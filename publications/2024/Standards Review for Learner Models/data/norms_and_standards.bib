	abstract = {The proposed standard consists of two parts. The first part of the standard defines the Enterprise Learner Record (ELR) data model for the various data objects that are used in the standard. The ELR data model preserves data ownership and integrity by providing indications to where raw learner data is stored and by providing the ability to track: - the learner's path through different organizations - the variety of learning experiences - demonstrated competencies - conferred credentials - employment history The data model describes the different ELR data elements and allows the expression of rules for how schema elements are populated and how this data is stored within a Learner Profile for auditing purposes within an organization. The second part of the standard defines the transfer methods and application programming interface (API) for communicating learner records between services that adhere to the specification. This includes the format of requests and the expected responses. The Learner API enables privacy and security of learner data as it is transmitted between connected systems through formal information exchange agreements (e.g., Interservice Connection Agreement). The Learner API follows the guidelines of the Representational State Transfer (REST) software architecture style and is transferred via HTTP requests and responses.},

A Learner Information server may exchange data with Learner Delivery systems or with other Learner Information servers. It is the responsibility of the Learner Information server to allow the owner of the learner information to define what part of the learner information can be shared with other systems. The core structures of the 1EdTech LIP are based upon: accessibilities; activities; affiliations; competencies; goals; identifications; interests; qualifications, certifications and licences; relationship; security keys; and transcripts.},

NOTE The proposed model proposed is not intended to define the representation of the entire spectrum of learner mobility information but to define the formally structured representation of official, institutionally attested achievement information for learners engaged in formal learning processes, in order to facilitate its recording and subsequent exchange within any international area within which learner mobility is possible. Achievement information structured and presented in compliance with this document could, of course, be used for other purposes, for instance, to provide descriptions of achievement to enrich a learner-owned report in an e-portfolio.
