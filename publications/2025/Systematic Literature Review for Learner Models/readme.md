## Learner Models: Design, Components, Structure, and Modelling
### A Systematic Literature Review

> Welcome to the Research Reporistory for the publication >**Learner Models**: Design, Components, Structure, and Modelling<.
> This repository contains the code and resources for the research publication. The goal of this project is to explore learner models in adaptive e-learning environments, with a focus on modelling learner models. Throughout this work, we will look at the complex environment of (guided) learning and find that many different disciplines work together in this context. In this paper, we explicitly focus only on the sub-disciplines of computer science (technical realization) and pedagogy (didactics of computer science and computer-supported learning) and deliberately leave out other important areas such as the humanities. We will look at learner models from the perspective of computer science and pedagogy to answer the major question: _What do learner models look like and how are they filled, kept up-to-date, and used?_. A criterion for the selection of the models is their possible (technical) feasibility, even if they are currently only described theoretically. Purely theoretical thought experiments without reference to practice or the possibility of implementation are not included in this research.

## Overview

This repository serves to ensure the reproducibility of the results and to create transparency for the reader. The repository includes the following components:

- **Data**: Raw and processed datasets used in the research.
- **Tools**: An interactive visualization tool to visualize the data and the visualization scripts for the UpSetPlots used in the article.
- **Results**: Preprocessed results, charts, figures, and analysis outputs.
- **Documentation**: A detailed description of the methodology, experiments, and findings.
- **Experimental**: Possible ideas and next steps from the results of the systematic literature review (_e.g., a classifier that assigns the components of the new created taxonomy_).
