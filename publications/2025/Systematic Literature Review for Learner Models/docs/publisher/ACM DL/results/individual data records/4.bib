abstract = {The notion of Digital Twin is known as a means to access otherwise dispersed lifecycle data of industrial devices, and enabling advanced reasoning on top of the data via various kinds of models (e.g. machine learning, simulation). Despite many studies on digital twins, there is still a need for common architectures, platforms and information meta-modelling that enable defining various lifecycle data in a harmonized way, as well as integrating the information with machine learning and simulation models; a gap that is filled by this paper. Our approach for the integration of various digital twin models addresses three known technical debt in machine learning systems: data pipeline jungle, undeclared/unstable data dependencies and undeclared consumers. Adopting such an integrated digital twin platform can reduce the required time and effort to develop and maintain digital twin-based solutions, as well as laying a foundation to support a variety of digital twin-based use cases.},

abstract = {Digital twin technology and virtual augmented reality technology have been developed rapidly in recent years, and in order to make users get a good immersive experience, predicting user preferences and realizing integrated human-computer interaction are urgent problems. The application model of deep learning is a research hotspot in recent years, especially in some more complex pattern recognition problems, which has produced a large number of relevant research results, and the study of user preference strategy based on user line analysis, as a multidimensional data analysis task, is suitable for building multidimensional models to solve. Therefore, firstly, using the behavioral characteristics data of users in virtual reality, the Kmeans algorithm is used to categorize the scenes in virtual reality according to the obtained multidimensional data, and the data is enhanced to overcome the problem of unknown data characteristics and improve the robustness of the model. Again, according to the high-dimensional characteristics of users' behavioral characteristics, Improved BP neural network preference recommendation model was studied, and compared with the traditional clustering model for analysis. The experiments show that the model improves on the accuracy of user characteristics analysis in the virtual environment while ensuring the response time, and can effectively provide preference prediction to users, thus improving their immersive experience.},

In this paper, we propose a Consistency Mean Teaching (CMT) method to improve clustering-based UDA Re-ID. Our CMT consists of two consistencies, i.e., an inter-view consistency and an intra-identity consistency. First, the inter-view consistency exploits a popular self-supervised training for UDA, which has been neglected in existing clustering-based UDA methods. Second, the intra-identity consistency imposes regulations between the teacher and student model to output consistent representations for different samples from the same identity. Third, these two consistencies are integrated into a single student-teacher framework and facilitate complementary benefits. Experimental results show that CMT brings significant improvements over the baseline and achieves competitive accuracy on four popular UDA re-ID.},

abstract = {Neural end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) is superior to conventional statistical methods in many ways. However, the exposure bias problem, that arises from the mismatch between the training and inference process in autoregressive models, remains an issue. It often leads to performance degradation in face of out-of-domain test data. To address this problem, we study a novel decoding knowledge transfer strategy, and propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation (MT-KD) network for Tacotron2 TTS model. The idea is to pre-train two Tacotron2 TTS teacher models in teacher forcing and scheduled sampling modes, and transfer the pre-trained knowledge to a student model that performs free running decoding. We show that the MT-KD network provides an adequate platform for neural TTS training, where the student model learns to emulate the behaviors of the two teachers, at the same time, minimizing the mismatch between training and run-time inference. Experiments on both Chinese and English data show that MT-KD system consistently outperforms the competitive baselines in terms of naturalness, robustness and expressiveness for in-domain and out-of-domain test data. Furthermore, we show that knowledge distillation outperforms adversarial learning and data augmentation in addressing the exposure bias problem.},

In this position paper, we elucidate unique characteristics and capabilities of a DT framework that enables realization of such promises as online learning of a physical environment, real-time monitoring of assets, Monte Carlo heuristic search for predictive prevention, on-policy, and off-policy reinforcement learning in real-time. We establish a conceptual layered architecture for a DT framework with decentralized implementation on cloud computing and enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) services for modeling and decision-making processes. The DT framework separates the control functions, deployed as a system of logically centralized process, from the physical devices under control, much like software-defined networking (SDN) in fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. To clarify the significance of DT in lowering the risk of development and deployment of innovative technologies on existing system, we discuss the application of implementing zero trust architecture (ZTA) as a necessary security framework in future data-driven communication networks.},

abstract = {Entity Matching (EM) is an important problem in data integration and cleaning. More recently, deep learning techniques, especially pre-trained language models, have been integrated into EM applications and achieved promising results. Unfortunately, the significant performance gain comes with the loss of explainability and transparency, deterring EM from the requirement of responsible data management. To address this issue, recent studies extended explainable AI techniques to explain black-box EM models. However, these solutions have the major drawbacks that (i) their explanations do not capture the unique semantics characteristics of the EM problem; and (ii) they fail to provide an objective method to quantitatively evaluate the provided explanations. In this paper, we propose Minun, a model-agnostic method to generate explanations for EM solutions. We utilize counterfactual examples generated from an EM customized search space as the explanations and develop two search algorithms to efficiently find such results. We also come up with a novel evaluation framework based on a student-teacher paradigm. The framework enables the evaluation of explanations of diverse formats by capturing the performance gain of a "student" model at simulating the target "teacher" model when explanations are given as side input. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on explaining state-of-the-art deep EM models on popular EM benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that Minun significantly outperforms popular explainable AI methods such as LIME and SHAP on both explanation quality and scalability.},

abstract = {Native ad is a popular type of online advertisement that has similar forms with the native content displayed on websites. Native ad click-through rate (CTR) prediction is useful for improving user experience and platform revenue. However, it is challenging due to the lack of explicit user intent, and user behaviors on the platform with native ads may be insufficient to infer users’ interest in ads. Fortunately, user behaviors exist on many online platforms that can provide complementary information for user-interest mining. Thus, leveraging multi-platform user behaviors is useful for native ad CTR prediction. However, user behaviors are highly privacy-sensitive, and the behavior data on different platforms cannot be directly aggregated due to user privacy concerns and data protection regulations. Existing CTR prediction methods usually require centralized storage of user behavior data for user modeling, which cannot be directly applied to the CTR prediction task with multi-platform user behaviors. In this article, we propose a federated native ad CTR prediction method named FedCTR, which can learn user-interest representations from cross-platform user behaviors in a privacy-preserving way. On each platform a local user model learns user embeddings from the local user behaviors on that platform. The local user embeddings from different platforms are uploaded to a server for aggregation, and the aggregated ones are sent to the ad platform for CTR prediction. Besides, we apply local differential privacy and differential privacy to the local and aggregated user embeddings, respectively, for better privacy protection. Moreover, we propose a federated framework for collaborative model training with distributed models and user behaviors. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset show that FedCTR can effectively leverage multi-platform user behaviors for native ad CTR prediction in a privacy-preserving manner.},

abstract = {Transfer learning is a popular software reuse technique in the deep learning community that enables developers to build custom models (students) based on sophisticated pretrained models (teachers). However, like vulnerability inheritance in traditional software reuse, some defects in the teacher model may also be inherited by students, such as well-known adversarial vulnerabilities and backdoors. Reducing such defects is challenging since the student is unaware of how the teacher is trained and/or attacked. In this paper, we propose ReMoS, a relevant model slicing technique to reduce defect inheritance during transfer learning while retaining useful knowledge from the teacher model. Specifically, ReMoS computes a model slice (a subset of model weights) that is relevant to the student task based on the neuron coverage information obtained by profiling the teacher model on the student task. Only the relevant slice is used to finetune the student model, while the irrelevant weights are retrained from scratch to minimize the risk of inheriting defects. Our experiments on seven DNN defects, four DNN models, and eight datasets demonstrate that ReMoS can reduce inherited defects effectively (by 63\% to 86\% for CV tasks and by 40\% to 61\% for NLP tasks) and efficiently with minimal sacrifice of accuracy (3\% on average).},

In this paper, we propose a user model pre-training method named UserBERT to learn universal user models on unlabeled user behavior data with two contrastive self-supervision tasks. The first one is masked behavior prediction and discrimination, aiming to model the contexts of user behaviors. The second one is behavior sequence matching, aiming to capture user interest stable in different periods. Besides, we propose a medium-hard negative sampling framework to select informative negative samples for better contrastive pre-training. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of UserBERT in user model pre-training.},

CL-DRD iteratively optimizes the dense retrieval (student) model by increasing the difficulty of the knowledge distillation data made available to it. In more detail, we initially provide the student model coarse-grained preference pairs between documents in the teacher's ranking, and progressively move towards finer-grained pairwise document ordering requirements. In our experiments, we apply a simple implementation of the CL-DRD framework to enhance two state-of-the-art dense retrieval models. Experiments on three public passage retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been increasing interest in adopting published neural retrieval models learned from corpora for text retrieval. Although these models achieve excellent retrieval performance, in terms of popular accuracy metrics, on datasets they have been trained, their performance on new text data might degrade. To obtain the desired retrieval performance on both the data used in training and the latest data collected after training, the simple approach of learning a new model from both datasets is not always feasible since the annotated dataset used in training is often not published along with the learned model. Knowledge amalgamation (KA) is an emerging technique to deal with this problem of inaccessibility of data used in previous training. KA learns a new model (called a student model) from new data by reusing (called amalgamating) a number of trained models (called teacher models) instead of accessing the teachers' original training data. However, in order to efficiently learn an accurate student model, the classical KA approach requires manual selection of an appropriate subset of teacher models for amalgamation. This manual procedure for selecting teacher models prevents the classical KA from being scaled to retrieval tasks for which a large number of candidate teacher models are ready to be reused.This paper presents Arm, an intelligent system for efficiently learning a neural retrieval model with the desired accuracy on incoming data by automatically amalgamating a subset of teacher models (called a teacher model combination or simply combination ) among a large number of teacher models. o filter combinations that fail to produce accurate student models, Arm employs Bayesian optimization to derive an accuracy prediction model based on sampled amalgamation tasks. Then, Arm uses the derived prediction model to exclude unqualified combinations without training the rest combinations.To speed up training, Arm introduces a cost model that picks the teacher model combination with the minimal training cost among all qualified teacher model combinations to produce the final student model. This paper will demonstrate the major workflow of Arm and present the produced student models to users.},

abstract = {The student of this course should already know how to use 3D modeling software to create FBX files. This Course expands on a short overview presented in the Educators' Forum. It is different in several ways. First presented is the overview of the context and justification of why botanically accurate plants and landscapes are important for educational applications, such as for use in museums, arboretums, and field trip experiences to botanical gardens. Connected to that goal is the importance of accuracy in visualization of not only the plant, but the entire virtual model of the landscape using plant inventory data and plant population density geographical information system (GIS) data. This then touches on the important issues for digital twins, as models and simulations of reality. Educational applications are different than entertainment application in the dimensions of information fidelity, or the trustworthiness of the presentation, and also the graphical fidelity, or the photorealistic capacity of the rendering systems. These are not always the same. High graphical fidelity is a byproduct of high information fidelity; the reverse is not always true. High graphical fidelity enhances information fidelity, if used for that purpose. Two immersive informal learning applications use cases are presented, one for augmented reality (AR), and the other as a virtual reality (VR) example. Both models used the same design and development process, integrating domain expertise, the botanist and the ecologist, with the art and software team to enhance the accuracy. Co-design, highly iterative review process, removes errors in educational content, and representation, as well as usability and may be generalized to any domain when learning is a goal of a digital twin. In this work it is referred to as the Expert-Learner-User-Experience (ELUX) design process. Game engines, as general purpose visualization tools, make multimodal and interaction possible to enhance user experiences and to make semantic material accessible to the learner. The technical constrains on the application design demanded two production pipelines. The AR and VR pipeline required low-polygon models for performance, and the newly released Unreal Engine 5 and Reality Capture created an opportunity to increase the graphical fidelity and the information fidelity of the plants and models. Virtual nature construction methods are covered in two processes, first with low-polygon 3D plant models ideal for AR and VR, and the second with high-polygon 3D plant models using Unreal Engine 5 and Reality Capture. As highly accurate 3D plant models, combined with stat of the art rendering for photorealistic models, when combined with GIS geospatial datasets, and visualized in immersive devices, digital twins of the natural world become possible. Once these models are connected to mathematical models of the natural world, dynamics driven by real time data feeds, and forecasts, both back in time and forward into the future will enhance our understanding of the natural world, and how it interacts with that of the artificial man-made world.},

Self-training is one of the semi-supervised learning paradigms that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data. It trains a teacher model on labeled data, and uses it to generate pseudo labels for unlabeled data. The labeled and pseudo-labeled data are then combined to train a student model. However, the pseudo labels generated from the teacher model are not sufficiently accurate. Thus, we propose a robust self-training strategy by exploring robust loss function to handle such noisy labels, which is model and task agnostic, and can be easily embedded with any prediction tasks. We have conducted molecular biology prediction tasks to gradually evaluate the performance of proposed robust self-training strategy. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently boosts the prediction performance, especially for molecular regression tasks, which have gained a 41.5\% average improvement.},

abstract = {Recently, Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL) which aims at addressing the Few-Shot Learning (FSL) problem across different domains has attracted rising attention. The core challenge of CD-FSL lies in the domain gap between the source and novel target datasets. Though many attempts have been made for CD-FSL without any target data during model training, the huge domain gap makes it still hard for existing CD-FSL methods to achieve very satisfactory results. Alternatively, learning CD-FSL models with few labeled target domain data which is more realistic and promising is advocated in previous work. Thus, in this paper, we stick to this setting and technically contribute a novel Multi-Expert Domain Decompositional Network (ME-D2N). Concretely, to solve the data imbalance problem between the source data with sufficient examples and the auxiliary target data with limited examples, we build our model under the umbrella of multi-expert learning. Two teacher models which can be considered to be experts in their corresponding domain are first trained on the source and the auxiliary target sets, respectively. Then, the knowledge distillation technique is introduced to transfer the knowledge from two teachers to a unified student model. Taking a step further, to help our student model learn knowledge from different domain teachers simultaneously, we further present a novel domain decomposition module that learns to decompose the student model into two domain-related sub-parts. This is achieved by a novel domain-specific gate that learns to assign each filter to only one specific domain in a learnable way. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

abstract = {Current lane detection methods are struggling with the invisibility lane issue caused by heavy shadows, severe road mark degradation, and serious vehicle occlusion. As a result, discriminative lane features can be barely learned by the network despite elaborate designs due to the inherent invisibility of lanes in the wild. In this paper, we target at finding an enhanced feature space where the lane features are distinctive while maintaining a similar distribution of lanes in the wild. To achieve this, we propose a novel Repainting and Imitating Learning (RIL) framework containing a pair of teacher and student without any extra data or extra laborious labeling. Specifically, in the repainting step, an enhanced ideal virtual lane dataset is built in which only the lane regions are repainted while non-lane regions are kept unchanged, maintaining the similar distribution of lanes in the wild. The teacher model learns enhanced discriminative representation based on the virtual data and serves as the guidance for a student model to imitate. In the imitating learning step, through the scale-fusing distillation module, the student network is encouraged to generate features that mimic the teacher model both on the same scale and cross scales. Furthermore, the coupled adversarial module builds the bridge to connect not only teacher and student models but also virtual and real data, adjusting the imitating learning process dynamically. Note that our method introduces no extra time cost during inference and can be plug-and-play in various cutting-edge lane detection networks. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the RIL framework both on CULane and TuSimple for four modern lane detection methods. The code and model will be available soon.},

abstract = {Wearable sensor-based Human Action Recognition (HAR) has achieved remarkable success recently. However, the accuracy performance of wearable sensor-based HAR is still far behind the ones from the visual modalities-based system (i.e., RGB video, skeleton and depth). Diverse input modalities can provide complementary cues and thus improve the accuracy performance of HAR, but how to take advantage of multi-modal data on wearable sensor-based HAR has rarely been explored. Currently, wearable devices, i.e., smartwatches, can only capture limited kinds of non-visual modality data. This hinders the multi-modal HAR association as it is unable to simultaneously use both visual and non-visual modality data. Another major challenge lies in how to efficiently utilize multi-modal data on wearable devices with their limited computation resources. In this work, we propose a novel Progressive Skeleton-to-sensor Knowledge Distillation (PSKD) model which utilizes only time-series data, i.e., accelerometer data, from a smartwatch for solving the wearable sensor-based HAR problem. Specifically, we construct multiple teacher models using data from both teacher (human skeleton sequence) and student (time-series accelerometer data) modalities. In addition, we propose an effective progressive learning scheme to eliminate the performance gap between teacher and student models. We also designed a novel loss function called Adaptive-Confidence Semantic (ACS), to allow the student model to adaptively select either one of the teacher models or the ground-truth label it needs to mimic. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PSKD method, we conduct extensive experiments on Berkeley-MHAD, UTD-MHAD and MMAct datasets. The results confirm that the proposed PSKD method has competitive performance compared to the previous mono sensor-based HAR methods.},

abstract = {Modelling the user's multiple behaviors is an essential part of modern e-commerce, whose widely adopted application is to jointly optimize click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) predictions. Most of existing methods overlook the effect of two key characteristics of the user's behaviors: for each item list, (i) contextual dependence refers to that the user's behaviors on any item are not purely determinated by the item itself but also are influenced by the user's previous behaviors (e.g., clicks, purchases) on other items in the same sequence; (ii) multiple time scales means that users are likely to click frequently but purchase periodically. To this end, we develop a new multi-scale user behavior network named  &lt;u&gt;H&lt;/u&gt; ierarchical r &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt; current  &lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt; anking  &lt;u&gt;O&lt;/u&gt; n the  &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt; ntire  &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt; pace (HEROES) which incorporates the contextual information to estimate the user multiple behaviors in a multi-scale fashion. Concretely, we introduce a hierarchical framework, where the lower layer models the user's engagement behaviors while the upper layer estimates the user's satisfaction behaviors. The proposed architecture can automatically learn a suitable time scale for each layer to capture the dynamic user's behavioral patterns. Besides the architecture, we also introduce the Hawkes process to form a novel recurrent unit which can not only encode the items' features in the context but also formulate the excitation or discouragement from the user's previous behaviors. We further show that HEROES can be extended to build unbiased ranking systems through combinations with the survival analysis technique. Extensive experiments over three large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model compared with the state-of-the-art methods. characteristics of the user's behaviors: for each item list, (i) contex- tual dependence refers to that the user's behaviors on any item are not purely determinated by the item itself but also are influenced by the user's previous behaviors (e.g., clicks, purchases) on other items in the same sequence; (ii) multiple time scales means that users are likely to click frequently but purchase periodically.

abstract = {Wearable-based human activity recognition (HAR) is commonly employed in real-world scenarios such as health monitoring, auxiliary diagnosis, etc. As implementing activity recognition is a daunting challenge in an open dynamic environment, incremental learning has become a common method to adapt to variable behavior patterns of users and create dynamic modeling in activity recognition. However, catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge with incremental learning. This is contrary to our expectations of identifying new activity classes while remembering existing ones. To address this problem, we propose a knowledge importance-based class incremental learning method called KiCi and construct an incremental learning model based on the framework of self-iterative knowledge distillation for dynamic activity recognition. To eliminate the prediction bias of the teacher model on the old knowledge, we utilize the trained weights of previous incremental steps generated by the teacher model as the prior knowledge to obtain knowledge importance. Then use it to make the student model have a reasonable trade-off between old and new knowledge and mitigate catastrophic forgetting by avoiding negative transfer. We conduct extensive experiments on four public HAR datasets and our method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.},

abstract = {E-commerce marketplaces protect shopper experience and trust at scale by deploying deep learning models trained on human annotated moderation data, for the identification and removal of advert imagery that does not comply with moderation policies (a.k.a. defective images). However, human moderation labels can be hard to source for smaller advert programs that target specific device types with separate formats or for recently launched locales with unique moderation policies. Additionally, the sourced labels can be noisy due to annotator biases or policy rules clubbing multiple types of transgressions into a single category. Therefore, training advert image moderation models necessitates an approach that can effectively improve the sample efficiency of training, weed out noise and discover latent moderation sub-labels in one go.Our work demonstrates the merits of automated sub-label discovery using self-labelling. We show that self-labelling approaches can be used to decompose an image moderation task into its hidden sub-tasks (corresponding to intercepting a single sub-label) in an unsupervised manner, thus helping with cases where the granularity of labels is inadequate. This enables us to bootstrap useful representations quickly, via low-capacity but fast-learning teacher models that each specialize in a single distinct sub-task of the main classification task. These sub-task specialists then distil their logits to a high-capacity but slow-learning generalist student model, thus allowing it to perform well on complex moderation tasks with relatively fewer labels than vanilla supervised training. We conduct all our experiments on the moderation of sexually explicit advert images (though this method can be utilized for any defect type) and show a sizeable improvement in NPV (+30.2\% absolute gain) viz-a-viz regular supervised baselines at a 1\% FPR level. A long-term A/B test of our deployed model shows a significant relative reduction (-45.6\%) in the prevalence of such advertisements compared to the previously deployed model.},

Therefore, it is particularly important to consider the communication overhead of FL. In this paper, we introduce knowledge distillation (KD) technology for FL to reduce communication overhead and improve communication efficiency in vehicular networks. The KD adopts the teacher-student pair method to train model. Specifically, we use KD technology to compress the teacher model into student model, where only the student model is sent to the central server, which can efficiently reduce the communication overhead. Further, considering different network environments and vehicle heterogeneity, we design a model switching algorithm to improve communication efficiency. Eventually, we perform some simulations for showing the advantages of proposed scheme over existing baselines.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been an increasing focus on data privacy, which is one of the most popular areas of research today. Due to legal restrictions, it is difficult to centralize data, so multi-party collaborative learning becomes difficult to achieve. In this paper, we propose a data collaborative analysis method for protecting data privacy: Knowledge Distillation-based Analysis (KDDA). The proposed method can effectively solve the above problems. The framework of the proposed method is based on "teacher-student" network. Specifically, each institution (e.g., hospital) used sensitive data to train local models, which we call teacher models. Then we introduce unlabeled public datasets. We design an aggregator that aggregates all teacher models to generate pseudo-labels for the public dataset. It is worth noting that to minimize the risk of data privacy exposure, we limit the number of generated pseudo-labels. Finally, we train the student model using semi-supervised learning on the public dataset with pseudo-labels. Since the student model is not directly trained on sensitive data, it will not lead to the leakage of data privacy, so it can be publicized. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on three popular image benchmark datasets: MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective.},

In this training framework, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based multi-UAV path planning algorithm. Based on decomposed actor structure in DRL, we design a pooling-based combined LSTM network to better understand different state information in a multi-UAV path planning task. Moreover, we also establish a digital twin platform for multi-UAV system, which has a high degree of simulation and visualization. The simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher mean rewards, and outperforms DDPG in average arrival rate by more than 30\%.},

We use reinforcement learning to systematically explore the digital twin solution space. Our proposal is significant because it advances the effective use of digital twins to new problem domains that have new potential for impact. Our approach contributes an original meta model for simulatable digital twin of industry scale techno-socioeconomic systems, agent-based implementation of the digital twin, and an architecture that serves as a risk-free experimentation aid to support simulation-based evidence-backed decision-making.

abstract = {Forward biomechanical simulation in HCI holds great promise as a tool for evaluation, design, and engineering of user interfaces. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has been used to simulate biomechanics in interaction, prior work has relied on unrealistic assumptions about the control problem involved, which limits the plausibility of emerging policies. These assumptions include direct torque actuation as opposed to muscle-based control; direct, privileged access to the external environment, instead of imperfect sensory observations; and lack of interaction with physical input devices. In this paper, we present a new approach for learning muscle-actuated control policies based on perceptual feedback in interaction tasks with physical input devices. This allows modelling of more realistic interaction tasks with cognitively plausible visuomotor control. We show that our simulated user model successfully learns a variety of tasks representing different interaction methods, and that the model exhibits characteristic movement regularities observed in studies of pointing. We provide an open-source implementation which can be extended with further biomechanical models, perception models, and interactive environments.},

With the growing interest on Digital Twin City, such systems are ideal for real-time microscopic traffic simulation. However, learning-based models are heavily biased towards the training data and could produce physically inconsistent outputs. In terms of microscopic traffic simulation, this could lead to unsafe driving behaviours causing vehicle collisions in the simulation. As for symbiotic simulation, this could severely affect the performance of real-time base simulation models resulting in inaccurate or unrealistic forecasts, which could, in turn, mislead JIT what-if analyses. To overcome this issue, a physics-guided data-driven modelling paradigm should be adopted so that the resulting model could capture both accurate and safe driving behaviours. However, very few works exist in the development of such a car-following model that can balance between simulation accuracy and physical consistency. Therefore, in this paper, a new “jointly-trained physics-guided Long Short-Term Memory (JTPG-LSTM)” neural network, is proposed and integrated to a dynamic data-driven simulation system to capture dynamic car-following behaviours. An extensive set of experiments was conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model from both modelling and simulation perspectives.},

abstract = {Machine learning models are often trained on sensitive data, such as medical records or bank transactions, posing high privacy risks. In fact, membership inference attacks can use the model parameters or predictions to determine whether a given data point was part of the training set. One of the most promising mitigations in literature is Knowledge Distillation (KD). This mitigation consists of first training a teacher model on the sensitive private dataset, and then transferring the teacher knowledge to a student model, by the mean of a surrogate dataset. The student model is then deployed in place of the teacher model. Unfortunately, KD on its own does not provide users much flexibility, meant as the possibility to arbitrarily decide how much utility to sacrifice to get membership-privacy. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that combines KD with confidence score masking. Concretely, we repeat the distillation procedure multiple times in series and, during each distillation, perturb the teacher predictions using confidence masking techniques. We show that our solution provides more flexibility than standard KD, as it allows users to tune the number of distillation rounds and the strength of the masking function. We implement our approach in a tool, RepKD, and assess our mitigation against white- and black-box attacks on multiple models and datasets. Even when the surrogate dataset is different from the private one (which we believe to be a more realistic setting than is commonly found in literature), our mitigation is able to make the black-box attack completely ineffective and significantly reduce the accuracy of the white-box attack at the cost of only 0.6\% test accuracy loss.},

abstract = {Digital twins are increasingly developed to support the development, operation, and maintenance of cyber-physical systems such as industrial elevators. However, industrial elevators continuously evolve due to changes in physical installations, introducing new software features, updating existing ones, and making changes due to regulations (e.g., enforcing restricted elevator capacity due to COVID-19), etc. Thus, digital twin functionalities (often built on neural network-based models) need to evolve themselves constantly to be synchronized with the industrial elevators. Such an evolution is preferred to be automated, as manual evolution is time-consuming and error-prone. Moreover, collecting sufficient data to re-train neural network models of digital twins could be expensive or even infeasible. To this end, we propose unceRtaInty-aware tranSfer lEarning enriched Digital Twins LATTICE, a transfer learning based approach capable of transferring knowledge about the waiting time prediction capability of a digital twin of an industrial elevator across different scenarios. LATTICE also leverages uncertainty quantification to further improve its effectiveness. To evaluate LATTICE, we conducted experiments with 10 versions of an elevator dispatching software from Orona, Spain, which are deployed in a Software in the Loop (SiL) environment. Experiment results show that LATTICE, on average, improves the Mean Squared Error by 13.131\% and the utilization of uncertainty quantification further improves it by 2.71\%.},

abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) are one form of datafication. They are virtual reflections of physical world entities, of objects and phenomena, and are rapidly becoming an asset for innovation. There is a growing body of literature on DTs in various technology-related fields. A critical thread has emerged within this body, warning on the danger to forget that the digital part is always only a partial representation of real life, and that this partiality is always selective and biased for a specific purpose. It may thus serve some group of stakeholders better than others. We contribute with a literature review on the current understanding and use of the DT concept in the field of HCI. Our results consolidate the current understanding of DTs’ potential in HCI and note the omission of the critical perspective within the reviewed literature. The paper opens discussion of what HCI can bring to DT development and use.},

abstract = {Knowing "what is happening" and "what will happen" of the mobility in a city is the building block of a data-driven smart city system. In recent years, mobility digital twin that makes a virtual replication of human mobility and predicting or simulating the fine-grained movements of the subjects in a virtual space at a metropolitan scale in near real-time has shown its great potential in modern urban intelligent systems. However, few studies have provided practical solutions. The main difficulties are four-folds: 1) the daily variation of human mobility is hard to model and predict; 2) the transportation network enforces a complex constraints on human mobility; 3) generating a rational fine-grained human trajectory is challenging for existing machine learning models; and 4) making a fine-grained prediction incurs high computational costs, which is challenging for an online system. Bearing these difficulties in mind, in this paper we propose a two-stage human mobility predictor that stratifies the coarse and fine-grained level predictions. In the first stage, to encode the daily variation of human mobility at a metropolitan level, we automatically extract citywide mobility trends as crowd contexts and predict long-term and long-distance movements at a coarse level. In the second stage, the coarse predictions are resolved to a fine-grained level via a probabilistic trajectory retrieval method, which offloads most of the heavy computations to the offline phase. We tested our method using a real-world mobile phone GPS dataset in the Kanto area in Japan, and achieved good prediction accuracy and a time efficiency of about 2 min in predicting future 1h movements of about 220K mobile phone users on a single machine to support more higher-level analysis of mobility prediction.},

abstract = {App-based ride-hailing services, such as Uber and Lyft, have become popular thanks to technology advancements including smartphones and 4G/5G network. However, little is known about to what degree their operations impact urban traffic since Transportation Network Companies seldom share their ride data due to business and user privacy reasons. Recently, transportation engineering researchers began to collect data in large cities trying to understand the transportation impacts of ride-hailing services, so as to assist transport planning and policy making. However, (1) there does not exist a general data collection approach applicable to any city, and (2) the studies were based on historical data and cannot project the future easily even though ride-hailing services are developing quickly.In this paper, we introduce our approach to building a digital twin of the transportation in the medium-sized city of Birmingham, Alabama. This digital twin is a transportation simulation model that incorporates transportation modes such as public transits and ride-hailing services, in addition to private vehicles that constitute the majority of Birmingham's traffic. With this digital twin, transportation engineers can flexibly analyze the impact of ride-hailing services under different scenarios, such as "if the number of Uber drivers doubles" which could happen in the near future. The digital twin may also enable new opportunities, such as being an environment for learning policies with reinforcement learning.To enable realistic transportation simulation, we propose a novel approach to collect Uber ride data that is easy to carry out in any city. This approach collects app screenshots about Uber rides from Uber drivers, and uses crowdsourcing to postprocess these screenshots to extract detailed ride information. We then fit a spatiotemporal distribution of Uber rides using the collected data via network kernel density estimation (KDE). The existing network KDE method is flawed in that the contributions of different data samples are not the same, so we propose a new formulation to solve this issue. The distribution combined with population statistics from census data enable the generation of realistic Uber rides for agent-based simulation.

abstract = {The digital twin, as a digital counterpart of a physical entity, has shown great potential in data center prototyping and predictive thermal management. In this regard, Computational Fluid Dynamics/Heat Transfer (CFD/HT) models have been widely adopted. However, the computing time of the CFD/HT simulation is prohibitively long in practice. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) has been explored to approximate the CFD/HT simulation by a linear combination of POD modes and coefficients. Existing approaches to calculating the POD coefficients use either the black-box interpolation or the simplified physical model, leading to unsatisfactory generalization ability. To advance existing approaches, this paper proposes Reducio, a physics-guided model reduction approach based on the POD to predict the temperature field by following two key phases of i) offline POD modes calculation and coefficients interpolation and ii) online coefficients extrapolation supervised by the principle of energy balance. To extrapolate the coefficients with limited training data, we adopt the Gaussian Process (GP) model to learn a nonlinear map between the boundary conditions and POD coefficients. We conduct two case studies in two data centers with different scales. Evaluation results in the edge data center show that Reducio achieves sub-1°C mean absolute error (MAE) in temperature field prediction compared with the CFD/HT simulation result, outperforming the existing method based on the simplified physical model by 1.5 °C. When evaluating in the industry-grade hyper-scale data center with the sensor measurements, around 1°C temperature prediction MAE is observed. Furthermore, Reducio can predict the full-fledged temperature field in real-time, making it a strong candidate for building data center predictive digital twins.},

In this paper, we propose an SVD method via similarity-based semi-supervised learning (SSSL_SVD). For one thing, we propose to enrich the diversity of training data using the self-training semi-supervised method (SSL). In SSL, pseudo labels of the unlabeled data are first generated by a pre-trained teacher model and are then used to train a student model. For another thing, we propose to measure the audio frame from a similarity-based perspective. Taking it into consideration, we could provide more appropriate learning targets. Finally, experiment results indicate that the proposed method achieved comparable results with state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms.},

Dynamic control actions are performed by a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. Our work includes experimentation and evaluation on a laboratory testbed where we have implemented basic information services on a service mesh supported by the Istio and Kubernetes platforms. We investigate different management objectives that include end-to-end delay bounds on service requests, throughput objectives, and service differentiation. These objectives are mapped onto reward functions that an RL agent learns to optimize, by executing control actions, namely, request routing and request blocking. We compute the control policies not on the testbed, but in a simulator, which speeds up the learning process by orders of magnitude. In our approach, the system model is learned on the testbed; it is then used to instantiate the simulator, which produces near-optimal control policies for various management objectives. The learned policies are then evaluated on the testbed using unseen load patterns.},

abstract = {As a promising solution for model compression, knowledge distillation (KD) has been applied in recommender systems (RS) to reduce inference latency. Traditional solutions first train a full teacher model from the training data, and then transfer its knowledge (iesoft labels ) to supervise the learning of a compact student model. However, we find such a standard distillation paradigm would incur serious bias issue --- popular items are more heavily recommended after the distillation. This effect prevents the student model from making accurate and fair recommendations, decreasing the effectiveness of RS.In this work, we identify the origin of the bias in KD --- it roots in the biased soft labels from the teacher, and is further propagated and intensified during the distillation. To rectify this, we propose a new KD method with a stratified distillation strategy. It first partitions items into multiple groups according to their popularity, and then extracts the ranking knowledge within each group to supervise the learning of the student. Our method is simple and teacher-agnostic --- it works on distillation stage without affecting the training of the teacher model. We conduct extensive theoretical and empirical studies to validate the effectiveness of our proposal. We release our code at: https://github.com/chengang95/UnKD.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection on multivariate time series (MTS) is an important research topic in data mining, which has a wide range of applications in information technology, financial management, manufacturing system, and so on. However, the state-of-the-art unsupervised deep learning models for MTS anomaly detection are vulnerable to noise and have poor performance on the training data containing anomalies. In this article, we propose a novel Self-Training based Anomaly Detection with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model called STAD-GAN to address the practical challenge. The STAD-GAN model consists of a generator-discriminator structure for adversarial learning and a neural network classifier for anomaly classification. The generator is learned to capture the normal data distribution, and the discriminator is learned to amplify the reconstruction error of abnormal data for better recognition. The proposed model is optimized with a self-training teacher-student framework, where a teacher model generates reliable high-quality pseudo-labels to train a student model iteratively with a refined dataset so that the performance of the anomaly classifier can be gradually improved. Extensive experiments based on six open MTS datasets show that STAD-GAN is robust to noise and achieves significant performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Predicting the evolution of Covid19 pandemic has been a challenge as it is significantly influenced by the characteristics of people, places and localities, dominant virus strains, extent of vaccination, and adherence to pandemic control interventions. Traditional SEIR based analyses help to arrive at a coarse-grained 'lumped up' understanding of pandemic evolution which is found wanting to determine locality-specific measures of controlling the pandemic. We comprehend the problem space from system theory perspective to develop a fine-grained simulatable city digital-twin for "in-silico" experimentations to systematically explore - Which indicators influence infection spread to what extent? Which intervention to introduce, and when, to control the pandemic with some a-priori assurance? How best to return to a new normal without compromising individual health safety?

Utilizing continuously updated crime records, the convolutional long short-term memory algorithm predicted areas crimes were most likely to occur. Then, a Monte Carlo traffic simulation simulated suspect vehicle movements to determine the most likely routes to flee crime scenes. Dynamic LPR placement predictions were made weekly, capturing the spatiotemporal variation in crimes and enhancing LPR performance relative to static placement.

During crane operations, kinematic data were collected, which were classified by machine learning algorithms for activity recognition and duration extraction. Based on the identified durations, Goodness-of-Fit techniques determined suitable probability density functions. The resulting probability density functions were used as input parameters in stochastic discrete event simulations. It was shown that with enriched data collection, probability density functions have to be updated. The data-driven discrete event simulation facilitates decision-making processes by providing more reliable real-time information for the planning of upcoming construction works.

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) is a prominent and growing area of machine learning that is rapidly changing how complex data in the world is modeled, interpreted, and utilized. To model these complexities, building accurate and robust DL models can often require heavy computation, memory, and energy costs. Because of this, researchers have been exploring methods to construct deep neural networks with small model sizes, light computation costs, and high segmentation accuracy. Knowledge distillation, a process in which a larger, cumbersome model is "distilled" into a smaller, student model, is a model compression method growing in popularity. In this research, we design efficient and compact deep networks using knowledge distillation to be applied to lane detection in autonomous vehicles with a low-cost computing environment in a classroom, such as Raspberry Pi. We address this by developing a student Convolutional Neural Network that reduces model size and minimizes accuracy loss as measured by the differences in MSE and R2 between the cumbersome model and the student model. Our research suggests that knowledge distillation can be applied to deep learning models trained for lane detection with improved model compactness and moderate accuracy preservation.},

To achieve this objective, we integrated a haptic feedback device to enable the user to receive feedback while the robotic arm performs the pick and place task. We have extensively tested this interface with a cohort of Electronics and Electrical engineering graduates from Glasgow College, UESTC, China. Our ultimate goal is to extend our interface to support multiple robots.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) systems are known for their susceptibility to cybersickness, which can seriously hinder users’ experience. Therefore, a plethora of recent research has proposed several automated methods based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to detect cybersickness. However, these detection methods are perceived as computationally intensive and black-box methods. Thus, those techniques are neither trustworthy nor practical for deploying on standalone VR head-mounted displays (HMDs). This work presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based framework VR-LENS for developing cybersickness detection ML models, explaining them, reducing their size, and deploying them in a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G processor-based Samsung A52 device. Specifically, we first develop a novel super learning-based ensemble ML model for cybersickness detection. Next, we employ a post-hoc explanation method, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Morris Sensitivity Analysis (MSA), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), and Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) to explain the expected results and identify the most dominant features. The super learner cybersickness model is then retrained using the identified dominant features. Our proposed method identified eye tracking, player position, and galvanic skin/heart rate response as the most dominant features for the integrated sensor, gameplay, and bio-physiological datasets. We also show that the proposed XAI-guided feature reduction significantly reduces the model training and inference time by 1.91X and 2.15X while maintaining baseline accuracy. For instance, using the integrated sensor dataset, our reduced super learner model outperforms the state-of-the-art works by classifying cybersickness into 4 classes (none, low, medium, and high) with an accuracy of and regressing (FMS 1–10) with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.03. Our proposed method can help researchers analyze, detect, and mitigate cybersickness in real time and deploy the super learner-based cybersickness detection model in standalone VR headsets.},

abstract = {Our time is characterized by big sprawling urban complexes that a majority of the human population chooses to live where interactions with the environment seem to be vanishing from our day to day lives. Our relationship with the planet’s natural ecosystem is paramount to our survival and well-being, a relationship that begins to form during our childhood years. Considering the above we propose a novel system which aims to give the ability to children to interact with the natural environment even when they have no access to it, from the classrooms in which they spend considerable parts of their lives. Specifically the proposed system is based on the technology of the Digital Twin, a core pillar of the 4th Industrial Revolution, and is comprised of a smart birdhouse and an electronic Digital Twin. The smart birdhouse can be deployed in a natural environment and collect atmospheric data like humidity and temperature values as well as record audio and pictures of possible bird visitors. At the same time the collected data will be available to the end user through a dashboard platform for atmospheric parameters and the digital electronic twin which will play the collected sound or pictures. With the above system we aim to achieve a greater and meaningful engagement of children with their natural habitat even when their urban environment makes it impractical or unfeasible.},

abstract = {The generation of large amounts of personal data provides data centers with sufficient resources to mine idiosyncrasy from private records. User modeling has long been a fundamental task with the goal of capturing the latent characteristics of users from their behaviors. However, centralized user modeling on collected data has raised concerns about the risk of data misuse and privacy leakage. As a result, federated user modeling has come into favor, since it expects to provide secure multi-client collaboration for user modeling through federated learning. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, existing federated learning methods that ignore the inconsistency among clients cannot be applied directly to practical user modeling scenarios, and moreover, they meet the following critical challenges: 1) Statistical heterogeneity. The distributions of user data in different clients are not always independently identically distributed (IID), which leads to unique clients with needful personalized information; 2) Privacy heterogeneity. User data contains both public and private information, which have different levels of privacy, indicating that we should balance different information shared and protected; 3) Model heterogeneity. The local user models trained with client records are heterogeneous, and thus require a flexible aggregation in the server; 4) Quality heterogeneity. Low-quality information from inconsistent clients poisons the reliability of user models and offsets the benefit from high-quality ones, meaning that we should augment the high-quality information during the process. To address the challenges, in this paper, we first propose a novel client-server architecture framework, namely Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning (HPFL), with a primary goal of serving federated learning for user modeling in inconsistent clients. More specifically, the client train and deliver the local user model via the hierarchical components containing hierarchical information from privacy heterogeneity to join collaboration in federated learning. Moreover, the client updates the personalized user model with a fine-grained personalized update strategy for statistical heterogeneity. Correspondingly, the server flexibly aggregates hierarchical components from heterogeneous user models in the case of privacy and model heterogeneity with a differentiated component aggregation strategy. In order to augment high-quality information and generate high-quality user models, we expand HPFL to the Augmented-HPFL (AHPFL) framework by incorporating the augmented mechanisms, which filters out low-quality information such as noise, sparse information and redundant information. Specially, we construct two implementations of AHPFL, i.e., AHPFL-SVD and AHPFL-AE, where the augmented mechanisms follow SVD (singular value decomposition) and AE (autoencoder), respectively. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of both HPFL and AHPFL frameworks.},

abstract = {Adaptive learning systems aim to emulate how skilled educators seek to provide every student the best possible learning experience. We investigate how such systems might be enriched by activities and indicators of social learning - an aspect of learning that focuses on the influences of learners’ social context and interactions. In this paper we describe a pilot study aimed at exploring the potential for including social learning in an adaptive system. Our analysis of the social learning scale demonstrates its validity and usefulness for our ongoing work. Our qualitative analysis of students’ learning demonstrates how social learning vary among students. We discuss how the rating scale results and observations of social learning can be integrated within a student model needed to drive an adaptive system. More generally, our work illustrates how theories of learning can contribute to the design of adaptive learning systems.},

abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) has been increasingly deployed in various real-world applications due to its unprecedented performance and automated capability of learning hidden representations. While DL can achieve high task performance, the training process of a DL model is both time- and resource-consuming. Therefore, current supply chains of the DL models assume the customers obtain pre-trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) from the third-party providers that have sufficient computing power. In the centralized setting, the model designer trains the DL model using the local dataset. However, the collected training data may contain erroneous or poisoned data points. The model designer might craft malicious training samples and inject a backdoor in the DL model distributed to the users. As a result, the user’s model will malfunction. In the federated learning setting, the cloud server aggregates local models trained on individual local datasets and updates the global model. In this scenario, the local client could poison the local training set and/or arbitrarily manipulate the local update. If the cloud server incorporates the malicious local gradients in model aggregation, the resulting global model will have degraded performance or backdoor behaviors. In this article, we present a comprehensive overview of contemporary data poisoning and model poisoning attacks against DL models in both centralized and federated learning scenarios. In addition, we review existing detection and defense techniques against various poisoning attacks.},
