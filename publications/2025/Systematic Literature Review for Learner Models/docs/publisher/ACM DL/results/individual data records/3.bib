abstract = {Encouraged by the success of deep learning in a variety of domains, we investigate the effectiveness of a novel application of such methods for detecting user confusion with eye-tracking data. We introduce an architecture that uses RNN and CNN sub-models in parallel, to take advantage of the temporal and visuospatial aspects of our data. Experiments with a dataset of user interactions with the ValueChart visualization tool show that our model outperforms an existing model based on a Random Forest classifier, resulting in a 22\% improvement in combined confused \&amp; not confused class accuracies.},

Further, a significant improvement in recognition performance of indoor activities is observed by incorporating Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. In this paper, we propose knowledge distillation based economic and efficient indoor activity recognition approach for low-cost resource constraint devices. Here, we adopt knowledge from teacher and trainee (cumbersome DNN models) for training student (compressed DNN model). Initially, student and trainee both are beginner and trainee helps the student in learning from the teacher. The student, after certain steps, is mature enough for directly learning from the teacher. We introduce an early halting mechanism for simultaneously reducing floating-point operations and training time of the student model.},

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been widely used for prototyping data centers. Evolving it to high-fidelity digital twin is desirable for the management and operations of large-scale data centers. Manually calibrating CFD model parameters to achieve twin-class fidelity by specially trained domain expert is tedious and labor-intensive. To reduce manual efforts, existing automatic calibration approaches developed for various computational models apply heuristics to search model configurations within an empirically defined parameter bound. However, in the context of CFD, each search step requires long-lasting CFD model's iterated solving, rendering these approaches impractical with increased model complexity. This paper presents Kalibre, a knowledge-based neural surrogate approach that performs CFD model calibration by iterating four key steps of i) training a neural surrogate model based on CFD-generated data, ii) finding the optimal parameters at the moment through neural surrogate retraining based on sensor-measured data, iii) configuring the found parameters back to the CFD model, and iv) validating the CFD model using sensor-measured data as the ground truth. Thus, the parameter search is offloaded to the neural surrogate which is ultra-faster than CFD model's iterated solving. To speed up the convergence of Kalibre, we integrate prior knowledge of the twinned data center's thermophysics into the neural surrogate design to improve its learning efficiency. With about five hours computation on a 32-core processor, Kalibre achieves mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.81°C and 0.75°C in calibrating two CFD models for two production data halls hosting thousands of servers each while requires fewer CFD solving processes than existing baseline approaches.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) is a promising technology for in-memory computing with high storage density, fast inference, and good compatibility with CMOS. However, the mapping of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) model on RRAM suffers from realistic device issues, especially the variation and quantization error, resulting in a significant reduction in inference accuracy. In this work, we first extract these statistical properties from 65 nm RRAM data on 300mm wafers. The RRAM data present 10--levels in quantization and 50\% variance, resulting in an accuracy drop to 31.76\% and 10.49\% for MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Based on the experimental data, we propose a combination of machine learning algorithms and on-line adaptation to recover the accuracy with the minimum overhead. The recipe first applies Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer an ideal model into a student model with statistical variations and 10 levels. Furthermore, an on-line sparse adaptation (OSA) method is applied to the DNN model mapped on to the RRAM array. Using importance sampling, OSA adds a small SRAM array that is sparsely connected to the main RRAM array; only this SRAM array is updated to recover the accuracy. As demonstrated on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, a 7.86\% area cost is sufficient to achieve baseline accuracy for the 65 nm RRAM devices.},

abstract = {In general, college students enrolled in computer science courses are provided some software design classes and exercises. In a cross-reviewing learning/exercise environment, however, beginners often cannot provide useful feedback and viewpoints to others. One of the reasons for this is that beginners are not confident in their understanding of the software design models. These learners should be encouraged by strengthening their understanding of the models. In this research, we propose a self-review supporting environment that provides learners with feedback generated by translating their Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams into natural language descriptions. This enables beginners to recognize discrepancies between what they would like to describe in their class diagrams and what they actually describe in their class diagrams by comparing them in natural language. We designed three types of templates to make learners aware of the discrepancies. Moreover, we performed an experiment to evaluate whether the feedback produced by translating a learner's model into natural language can support the learner to detect errors in the model themselves, and whether this feedback can support the learner to correct errors in the model themselves. The results of the experiment indicated that the subjects detected errors in their class diagrams with 89.2\% accuracy and detected 47.3\% of all errors in their diagrams. Furthermore, the subjects corrected the errors they correctly detected with 78.6\% accuracy.},

abstract = {More than a hundred countries implement freedom of information laws. In the UK, the Freedom of Information Act 2000 [1] (FOIA) states that the government's documents must be made freely available, or opened, to the public. Moreover, all central UK government departments' documents that have a historic value must be transferred to the The National Archives (TNA) within twenty years of the document's creation. However, government documents can contain sensitive information, such as personal information or information that would likely damage international relations if it was opened. Therefore, all government documents that are to be publicly archived must be sensitivity reviewed to identify and redact the sensitive information. However, the lack of structure in digital document collections and the volume of digital documents that are to be sensitivity reviewed mean that the traditional manual sensitivity review process is not practical for digital sensitivity review.In this thesis, we argue that sensitivity classification can be deployed to assist government departments and human reviewers to sensitivity review born-digital government documents. However, classifying sensitive information is a complex task, since sensitivity is context-dependent and can require a human to judge on the likely effect of releasing the information into the public domain. Moreover, sensitivity is not necessarily topic-oriented, i.e., it is usually dependent on a combination of what is being said and about whom.Through a thorough empirical evaluation, we show that a text classification approach is effective for sensitivity classification and can be improved by identifying the vocabulary, syntactic and semantic document features that are reliable indicators of sensitive or nonsensitive text [2]. Furthermore, we propose to reduce the number of documents that have to be reviewed to learn an effective sensitivity classifier through an active learning strategy in which a sensitivity reviewer redacts any sensitive text in a document as they review it, to construct a representation of the sensitivities in a collection [3].With this in mind, we propose a novel framework for technology-assisted sensitivity review that can prioritise the most appropriate documents to be reviewed at specific stages of the sensitivity review process. Furthermore, our framework can provide the reviewers with useful information to assist them in making their reviewing decisions. We conduct two user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework for assisting with two distinct digital sensitivity review scenarios, or user models. Firstly, in the limited review user model, which addresses a scenario in which there are insufficient reviewing resources available to sensitivity review all of the documents in a collection, we show that our proposed framework can increase the number of documents that can be reviewed and released to the public with the available reviewing resources [4]. Secondly, in the exhaustive review user model, which addresses a scenario in which all of the documents in a collection will be manually sensitivity reviewed, we show that providing the reviewers with useful information about the documents that contain sensitive information can increase the reviewers' accuracy, reviewing speed and agreement [5].This is the first thesis to investigate automatically classifying FOIA sensitive information to assist digital sensitivity review. The central contributions are our proposed framework for technology-assisted sensitivity review and our sensitivity classification approaches. Our contributions are validated using a collection of government documents that are sensitivity reviewed by expert sensitivity reviewers to identify two FOIA sensitivities, namely international relations and personal information. Our results demonstrate that our proposed framework is a viable technology for assisting digital sensitivity review.Supervisors Prof. Iadh Ounis (University of Glasgow), Dr. Craig Macdonald (University of Glasgow)Available from: http://theses.gla.ac.uk/41076},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a great deal of research in developing end-to-end speech recognition models, which enable simplifying the traditional pipeline and achieving promising results. Despite their remarkable performance improvements, end-to-end models typically require expensive computational cost to show successful performance. To reduce this computational burden, knowledge distillation (KD), which is a popular model compression method, has been used to transfer knowledge from a deep and complex model (teacher) to a shallower and simpler model (student). Previous KD approaches have commonly designed the architecture of the student by reducing the width per layer or the number of layers of the teacher. This structural reduction scheme might limit the flexibility of model selection since the student model structure should be similar to that of the given teacher. To cope with this limitation, we propose a KD method for end-to-end speech recognition, namely TutorNet, that applies KD techniques across different types of neural networks at the hidden representation-level as well as the output-level. For concrete realizations, we firstly apply representation-level knowledge distillation (RKD) during the initialization step, and then apply the softmax-level knowledge distillation (SKD) combined with the original task learning. When the student is trained with RKD, we make use of frame weighting that points out the frames to which the teacher pays more attention. Through a number of experiments, it is verified that TutorNet not only distills the knowledge between networks with different topologies but also significantly contributes to improving the performance of the distilled student.},

abstract = {The Elo rating system has been recognised as an effective method for modelling students and items within adaptive educational systems. A common characteristic across Elo-based learner models is that they are not sensitive to the lag time between two consecutive interactions of a student within the system. Implicitly, this characteristic assumes that students do not learn or forget between two consecutive interactions. However, this assumption seems insufficient in the context of adaptive learning systems where students could have improved their mastery through practising outside of the system or that their mastery may be declined due to forgetting. In this paper, we extend the existing works on the use of rating systems for modelling learners in adaptive educational systems by proposing a new learner model called MV-Glicko that builds on the Glicko rating system. MV-Glicko is sensitive to the lag time between two consecutive interactions of a student within the system and models it as a parameter that captures the confidence of the system in the current inferred rating. We apply MV-Glicko on three public data sets and three data sets obtained from an adaptive learning system and provide evidence that MV-Glicko outperforms other conventional models in estimating students’ knowledge mastery.},

Personalization systems typically build a user model, aiming to characterize the user at hand, and then use this model to personalize the interaction. Personalization and user modeling, however, are often intrinsically at odds with each other (a fact some times referred to as the personalization paradox). In this paper, we take a closer look at this personalization paradox, and identify two ways in which it might manifest: feedback loops and moving targets. To illustrate these issues, we report results in the domain of personalized exergames (videogames for physical exercise), and describe our early steps to address some of the issues arisen by the personalization paradox.},

abstract = {Privacy-preserving deep learning computing becomes popular these days as it helps protect, for example, both user data and deep neural network (DNN) model parameters at the same time with cryptographic techniques. In particular, significant efforts have been made to leverage secure two-party computation schemes for preventing user/model data from disclosure during DNN inference. Nevertheless, the existing works require manual intervention while converting trained models into secure computation programs, which is not scalable to modern deep networks efficiently. In this work, we propose a compiler framework, TONIC, to do the conversion automatically with scalability. Given a pre-trained DNN model, TONIC converts it into one of two secure two-party computation languages, i.e., ObliVM and ABY. Based on tailored backends built on top of a DNN compiler, TVM, our case studies show that TONIC is able to automatically convert popular DNN models, such as CryptoNets and MobileNetV2, into the corresponding programs for secure computations.},

abstract = {To help facilitate play and learning, game-based educational activities often feature a computational agent as a co-player. Personalizing this agent's behavior to the student player is an active area of research, and prior work has demonstrated the benefits of personalized educational interaction across a variety of domains. A critical research challenge for personalized educational agents is real-time student modeling. Most student models are designed for and trained on only a single task, which limits the variety, flexibility, and efficiency of student player model learning. In this paper we present a research project applying transfer learning methods to student player models over different educational tasks, studying the effects of an algorithmic "multi-task personalization" approach on the accuracy and data efficiency of student model learning. We describe a unified robotic game system for studying multi-task personalization over two different educational games, each emphasizing early language and literacy skills such as rhyming and spelling. We present a flexible Gaussian Process-based approach for rapidly learning student models from interactive play in each game, and a method for transferring each game's learned student model to the other via a novel instance-weighting protocol based on task similarity. We present results from a simulation-based investigation of the impact of multi-task personalization, establishing the core viability and benefits of transferrable student models and outlining new questions for future in-person research.},

The procedure is inefficient, and human decisions highly bias the results. While computational methods are used to assist various design tasks, there has not been any holistic approach to automate the design of input components. My thesis proposed a series of Computational Input Design workflows: I envision a sample-efficient multi-objective optimization algorithm that cleverly selects design instances, which are instantly deployed on physical simulators. A meta-reinforcement learning user model then simulates the user behaviors when using the design instance upon the simulators. The new workflows derive Pareto-optimal designs with high efficiency and automation. I demonstrate designing a push-button via the proposed methods. The resulting designs outperform the known baselines. The Computational Input Design process can be generalized to other devices, such as joystick, touchscreen, mouse, controller, etc.},

abstract = {With the passage of the 2018 U.S. Farm Bill, Industrial Hemp production is moved from limited pilot programs to a regulated agriculture production system. However, Industrial Hemp Supply Chain (IHSC) faces critical challenges, including high complexity and variability, very limited production knowledge, and lack of data/information tracking. In this paper, we propose blockchain-enabled IHSC and develop a preliminary simulation-based digital twin for this distributed cyber-physical system (CPS) to support the process learning and risk management. Basically, we develop a two-layer blockchain with proof of authority smart contract, which can track the data and key information, improve the supply chain transparency, and leverage local authorities and state regulators to ensure the quality control verification. Then, we introduce a simulation-based digital twin for IHSC management, which can characterize the process spatial-temporal causal interdependencies and dynamic evolution to guide risk control and decision making. Our empirical study demonstrates the promising performance of proposed platform.},

abstract = {With the increasing popularity of Digital Twin, there is an opportunity to employ deep learning models in symbiotic simulation system. Symbiotic simulation can replicate multiple what-if simulation instances from its real-time reference simulation (base simulation) for short-term forecasting. Hence, it is a useful tool for just-in-time decision making process. Recent trends on symbiotic simulation studies emphasize on its combination with machine learning. Despite its success and usefulness, very few works focus on application of such a hybrid system in microscopic traffic simulation. Existing application of machine (deep) learning models in microscopic traffic simulation is confined to either predictive analysis or offline simulation-based prescriptive analysis. Thus, there is also lack of work on updating parameters of a deep learning model dynamically for real-time traffic simulation. This is necessary if the learning-based model is to be used as part of the base simulation so that "Just-in-time (JIT)" what-if simulation initialized from the model can make better short-term forecasts. This paper proposes a data-driven modelling and simulation framework to dynamically update parameters of Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) for JIT microscopic traffic simulation. Extensive experiments were carried out to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of more accurate short-term forecasting than other baseline models.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous mobile computing have enabled ride-hailing services to collect vast amounts of behavioral data of riders and drivers and optimize supply and demand matching in real time. While these mobility service providers have some degree of control over the market by assigning vehicles to requests, they need to deal with the uncertainty arising from self-interested driver behavior since workers are usually free to drive when they are not assigned tasks. If a driver’s behavior can be accurately replicated on the digital twin, more detailed and realistic counterfactual simulations will enable decision making to improve mobility services as well as to validate urban planning. In this work, we formulate the problem of passenger-vehicle matching in a sparsely connected graph and proposed an algorithm to derive an equilibrium policy in a multi-agent environment. Our framework combines value iteration methods to estimate the optimal policy given expected state visitation and policy propagation to compute multi-agent state visitation frequencies. Furthermore, we developed a method to learn the driver’s reward function transferable to an environment with significantly different dynamics from training data. We evaluated the robustness to changes in spatio-temporal supply-demand distributions and deterioration in data quality using a real-world taxi trajectory dataset; our approach significantly outperforms several baselines in terms of imitation accuracy. The computational time required to obtain an equilibrium policy shared by all vehicles does not depend on the number of agents, and even on the scale of real-world services, it takes only a few seconds on a single CPU.},

abstract = {One-shot automated essay scoring (AES) aims to assign scores to a set of essays written specific to a certain prompt, with only one manually scored essay per distinct score. Compared to the previous-studied prompt-specific AES which usually requires a large number of manually scored essays for model training (e.g., about 600 manually scored essays out of totally 1000 essays), one-shot AES can greatly reduce the workload of manual scoring. In this paper, we propose a Transductive Graph-based Ordinal Distillation (TGOD) framework to tackle the task of one-shot AES. Specifically, we design a transductive graph-based model as a teacher model to generate pseudo labels of unlabeled essays based on the one-shot labeled essays. Then, we distill the knowledge in the teacher model into a neural student model by learning from the high confidence pseudo labels. Different from the general knowledge distillation, we propose an ordinal-aware unimodal distillation which makes a unimodal distribution constraint on the output of student model, to tolerate the minor errors existed in pseudo labels. Experimental results on the public dataset ASAP show that TGOD can improve the performance of existing neural AES models under the one-shot AES setting and achieve an acceptable average QWK of 0.69.},

abstract = {Semi-supervised learning on graphs is an important problem in the machine learning area. In recent years, state-of-the-art classification methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown their superiority over traditional ones such as label propagation. However, the sophisticated architectures of these neural models will lead to a complex prediction mechanism, which could not make full use of valuable prior knowledge lying in the data, e.g., structurally correlated nodes tend to have the same class. In this paper, we propose a framework based on knowledge distillation to address the above issues. Our framework extracts the knowledge of an arbitrary learned GNN model (teacher model), and injects it into a well-designed student model. The student model is built with two simple prediction mechanisms, i.e., label propagation and feature transformation, which naturally preserves structure-based and feature-based prior knowledge, respectively. In specific, we design the student model as a trainable combination of parameterized label propagation and feature transformation modules. As a result, the learned student can benefit from both prior knowledge and the knowledge in GNN teachers for more effective predictions. Moreover, the learned student model has a more interpretable prediction process than GNNs. We conduct experiments on five public benchmark datasets and employ seven GNN models including GCN, GAT, APPNP, SAGE, SGC, GCNII and GLP as the teacher models. Experimental results show that the learned student model can consistently outperform its corresponding teacher model by on average. Code and data are available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/CPF},

abstract = {User modeling aims to capture the latent characteristics of users from their behaviors, and is widely applied in numerous applications. Usually, centralized user modeling suffers from the risk of privacy leakage. Instead, federated user modeling expects to provide a secure multi-client collaboration for user modeling through federated learning. Existing federated learning methods are mainly designed for consistent clients, which cannot be directly applied to practical scenarios, where different clients usually store inconsistent user data. Therefore, it is a crucial demand to design an appropriate federated solution that can better adapt to user modeling tasks, and however, meets following critical challenges: 1) Statistical heterogeneity. The distributions of user data in different clients are not always independently identically distributed which leads to personalized clients; 2) Privacy heterogeneity. User data contains both public and private information, which have different levels of privacy. It means we should balance different information to be shared and protected; 3) Model heterogeneity. The local user models trained with client records are heterogeneous which need flexible aggregation in the server. In this paper, we propose a novel client-server architecture framework, namely Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning (HPFL) to serve federated learning in user modeling with inconsistent clients. In the framework, we first define hierarchical information to finely partition the data with privacy heterogeneity. On this basis, the client trains a user model which contains different components designed for hierarchical information. Moreover, client processes a fine-grained personalized update strategy to update personalized user model for statistical heterogeneity. Correspondingly, the server completes a differentiated component aggregation strategy to flexibly aggregate heterogeneous user models in the case of privacy and model heterogeneity. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the HPFL framework.},

abstract = {Question Answering (QA) systems have been extensively studied in both academia and the research community due to their wide real-world applications. When building such industrial-scale QA applications, we are facing two prominent challenges, i.e., i) lacking a sufficient amount of training data to learn an accurate model and ii) requiring high inference speed for online model serving. There are generally two ways to mitigate the above-mentioned problems. One is to adopt transfer learning to leverage information from other domains; the other is to distill the “dark knowledge” from a large teacher model to small student models. The former usually employs parameter sharing mechanisms for knowledge transfer, but does not utilize the “dark knowledge” of pre-trained large models. The latter usually does not consider the cross-domain information from other domains. We argue that these two types of methods can be complementary to each other. Hence in this work, we provide a new perspective on the potential of the teacher-student paradigm facilitating cross-domain transfer learning, where the teacher and student tasks belong to heterogeneous domains, with the goal to improve the student model’s performance in the target domain. Our framework considers the “dark knowledge” learned from large teacher models and also leverages the adaptive hints to alleviate the domain differences between teacher and student models. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two text matching tasks for retrieval-based QA systems. Results show the proposed method has better performance than the competing methods including the existing state-of-the-art transfer learning methods. We have also deployed our method in an online production system and observed significant improvements compared to the existing approaches in terms of both accuracy and cross-domain robustness.},

Learner support requires transparent and intelligible capacity building tools to grasp the idea of such complex systems and develop integrated design and engineering skills. Tangible components can help as physical cognitive artifacts for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications being part of CPS. However, the intertwining of physical and digital elements requires a didactically grounded vocabulary and development concept to learn with tangible artifacts as mental representation. In this paper we introduce an integrated tangible design and engineering learning support system. It synchronizes physical IoT components with their DT representation, as composed by means of M5Stack (m5stack.com), UIFlow© (flow.m5stack.com) using Blockly for visual programming, and the diagrammatic D3j-editor (D3js.org) for editing DTs and monitoring/controlling CPS behavior. Learners can design and engineer a CPS either via tangible IoT (control) elements, or digitally. Prepared use cases from smart home management and home healthcare serve as teasers for actively engaging learners in CPS development tasks.},

However, this may not be practical in many real-world applications, and it incurs additional computational costs. To achieve better efficiency, we propose a decentralized framework: Multi-Agent Ensemble. The framework leverages edge computing to facilitate ensemble learning techniques by focusing on the balancing of access restrictions (small sub-dataset) and accuracy enhancement. Specifically, network edge nodes (learners) are utilized to model classifications and predictions in our framework. Data is then distributed to multiple base learners who exchange data via an interaction mechanism to achieve improved prediction. The proposed approach relies on a training model rather than conventional centralized learning. Findings from the experimental evaluations using 20 real-world datasets suggest that Multi-Agent Ensemble outperforms other ensemble approaches in terms of accuracy even though the base learners require fewer samples (i.e., significant reduction in computation costs).},

Achieving this for new buildings is feasible, but it may be difficult to transform existing buildings to ZEBs. Digital twins provide a promising approach to monitor existing buildings and further increase their energy efficiency. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical entity. It has several applications in product design, product cycle, and fault detection. This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines physics-based and machine learning methods to create a DT for the built environment. A case study for a digital twin of a single room is also discussed. The initial comparison of cooling energy between the physical testbed and the DT model shows promising results for future development. The limitations, challenges, and future development of the approach are also addressed in the paper.},

abstract = {An emerging recipe for achieving state-of-the-art effectiveness in neural document re-ranking involves utilizing large pre-trained language models - e.g., BERT - to evaluate all individual passages in the document and then aggregating the outputs by pooling or additional Transformer layers. A major drawback of this approach is high query latency due to the cost of evaluating every passage in the document with BERT. To make matters worse, this high inference cost and latency varies based on the length of the document, with longer documents requiring more time and computation. To address this challenge, we adopt an intra-document cascading strategy, which prunes passages of a candidate document using a less expensive model, called ESM, before running a scoring model that is more expensive and effective, called ETM. We found it best to train ESM (short for Efficient Student Model) via knowledge distillation from the ETM (short for Effective Teacher Model) e.g., BERT. This pruning allows us to only run the ETM model on a smaller set of passages whose size does not vary by document length. Our experiments on the MS MARCO and TREC Deep Learning Track benchmarks suggest that the proposed Intra-Document Cascaded Ranking Model (IDCM) leads to over 400\% lower query latency by providing essentially the same effectiveness as the state-of-the-art BERT-based document ranking models.},

abstract = {The knowledge of a deep learning model may be transferred to a student model, leading to intellectual property infringement or vulnerability propagation. Detecting such knowledge reuse is nontrivial because the suspect models may not be white-box accessible and/or may serve different tasks. In this paper, we propose ModelDiff, a testing-based approach to deep learning model similarity comparison. Instead of directly comparing the weights, activations, or outputs of two models, we compare their behavioral patterns on the same set of test inputs. Specifically, the behavioral pattern of a model is represented as a decision distance vector (DDV), in which each element is the distance between the model's reactions to a pair of inputs. The knowledge similarity between two models is measured with the cosine similarity between their DDVs. To evaluate ModelDiff, we created a benchmark that contains 144 pairs of models that cover most popular model reuse methods, including transfer learning, model compression, and model stealing. Our method achieved 91.7\% correctness on the benchmark, which demonstrates the effectiveness of using ModelDiff for model reuse detection. A study on mobile deep learning apps has shown the feasibility of ModelDiff on real-world models.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems (RS) have employed knowledge distillation which is a model compression technique training a compact student model with the knowledge transferred from a pre-trained large teacher model. Recent work has shown that transferring knowledge from the teacher's intermediate layer significantly improves the recommendation quality of the student. However, they transfer the knowledge of individual representation point-wise and thus have a limitation in that primary information of RS lies in the relations in the representation space. This paper proposes a new topology distillation approach that guides the student by transferring the topological structure built upon the relations in the teacher space. We first observe that simply making the student learn the whole topological structure is not always effective and even degrades the student's performance. We demonstrate that because the capacity of the student is highly limited compared to that of the teacher, learning the whole topological structure is daunting for the student. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Hierarchical Topology Distillation (HTD) which distills the topology hierarchically to cope with the large capacity gap. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors. We also provide in-depth analyses to ascertain the benefit of distilling the topology for RS.},

As the data don't need a lot of manual annotation, unsupervised cross-modal hashing has a wider application prospect than supervised method. However, the existing unsupervised methods are difficult to achieve satisfactory performance due to the lack of credible supervisory information. To solve this problem, inspired by knowledge distillation, we propose a novel unsupervised Knowledge Distillation Cross-Modal Hashing method (KDCMH), which can use similarity information distilled from unsupervised method to guide supervised method. Specifically, firstly, the teacher model adopted an unsupervised distribution-based similarity hashing method, which can construct a modal fusion similarity matrix.Secondly, under the supervision of teacher model distillation information, student model can generate more discriminative hash codes. In two public datasets NUS-WIDE and MIRFLICKR-25K, extensive experiments have proved the significant improvement of KDCMH on several representative unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods.},

abstract = {Breathing biomarkers, such as breathing rate, fractional inspiratory time, and inhalation-exhalation ratio, are vital for monitoring the user's health and well-being. Accurate estimation of such biomarkers requires breathing phase detection, i.e., inhalation and exhalation. However, traditional breathing phase monitoring relies on uncomfortable equipment, e.g., chestbands. Smartphone acoustic sensors have shown promising results for passive breathing monitoring during sleep or guided breathing. However, detecting breathing phases using acoustic data can be challenging for various reasons. One of the major obstacles is the complexity of annotating breathing sounds due to inaudible parts in regular breathing and background noises. This paper assesses the potential of using smartphone acoustic sensors for passive unguided breathing phase monitoring in a natural environment. We address the annotation challenges by developing a novel variant of the teacher-student training method for transferring knowledge from an inertial sensor to an acoustic sensor, eliminating the need for manual breathing sound annotation by fusing signal processing with deep learning techniques. We train and evaluate our model on the breathing data collected from 131 subjects, including healthy individuals and respiratory patients. Experimental results show that our model can detect breathing phases with 77.33\% accuracy using acoustic sensors. We further present an example use-case of breathing phase-detection by first estimating the biomarkers from the estimated breathing phases and then using these biomarkers for pulmonary patient detection. Using the detected breathing phases, we can estimate fractional inspiratory time with 92.08\% accuracy, the inhalation-exhalation ratio with 86.76\% accuracy, and the breathing rate with 91.74\% accuracy. Moreover, we can distinguish respiratory patients from healthy individuals with up to 76\% accuracy. This paper is the first to show the feasibility of detecting regular breathing phases towards passively monitoring respiratory health and well-being using acoustic data captured by a smartphone.},

abstract = {Medical image segmentation task has been a hot research topic in the field of computer vision and natural field for many years. With the rapid development and application of convolutional neural networks, more and more medical segmentation models based on deep learning have been proposed, and more successful results and applications have been achieved in many disease segmentation tasks.The effect of medical image segmentation tasks is getting better. However, the computational cost of the medical image segmentation model has not been improved well. In this work, we propose a medical image segmentation model compression scheme that is theoretically applicable to all convolutional neural networks. First, we choose to construct a search space based on the number of convolution kernels at each location where convolution is used in the model, and then use neural network search to find a sub-network in this search space with less computation and high segmentation accuracy. Aiming at the encoding-decoding structure of the segmentation network, we propose Symmetrical-NAS to ensure that the encoding structure and decoding structure of any sub-network in our search space are symmetrical. Since it is too expensive to traverse the entire search space for training to find the most suitable architecture, we use weight sharing for training. During training, a sub-network in the search space is randomly selected for activation each time. Second, we use the method of knowledge distillation for training. We use the basic model as the teacher model and the searched sub-network as the student model to realize the knowledge transfer between the teacher model and the student model. Third, we use separable convolution instead of convolutional layer. Our method can be applied to various medicial image segmentation models regardless of model architectures and learning algorithms. Our method can reduce the computation of medical image segmentation models by 90\texttimes{} regarding FLOPs with little loss of segmentation effect. The code and demo will be publicly available.},

abstract = {3D reconstruction of stereo endoscope image, as an enabling technique for varied surgical systems, e.g., medical droids, navigations, etc., suffers from severe overfitting problems due to scarce labels. Semi-supervised learning based on Teacher-Student Network (TSN) is a potential solution, which utilizes a supervised teacher model trained on available labeled data to teach a student model on all images via assigning them pseudo labels. However, TSN often faces a dilemma: if given only few labeled endoscope images, the teacher model will be trained to be defective and induce high-noised pseudo labels, degrading the student model significantly. To solve this, we propose an improved TSN for a robust 3D reconstruction of stereo endoscope image. Specifically, two novel modules are introduced: 1) a semi-supervised teacher model based on adversarial learning to produce mostly correct pseudo labels by forcing a consistency in predictions for both labeled and unlabeled data, and 2) a confidence network to further filter out noisy pseudo labels by estimating a confidence for each prediction of the teacher model. By doing so, the student model is able to distill knowledge from more accurate and noiseless pseudo labels, thus achieving improved performance. Experimental results on two public datasets show that our improved TSN achieves a superior performance than the state-of-the-arts by reducing the averaged disparity error by at least 13.5\%.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the task of action anticipation on egocentric videos. Previous methods ignore explicit modeling of the global context relation among past and future actions, which is not an easy task due to the vacancy of unobserved videos. To solve this problem, we propose a Multimodal Global Relation Knowledge Distillation (MGRKD) framework to distill the knowledge learned from full videos to improve the action anticipation task on partially observed videos. The proposed MGRKD has a teacher-student learning strategy, where either the teacher or student model has three branches of global relation graph networks (GRGN) to explore the pairwise relations between past and future actions based on three kinds of features (i.e., RGB, motion or object). The teacher model has a similar architecture with the student model, except that the teacher model uses true feature of the future video snippet to build the graph in GRGN while the student model uses a progressive GRU to predict an initialized node feature of future snippet in GRGN. Through the teacher-student learning strategy, the discriminative features and relation knowledge of the past and future actions learned in the teacher model can be distilled to the student model. The experiments on two egocentric video datasets EPIC-Kitchens and EGTEA Gaze+ show that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performances.},

abstract = {Over the last few decades, artificial intelligence research has made tremendous strides, but it still heavily relies on fixed datasets in stationary environments. Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines how AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data in the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as deepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current multimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can detect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to their reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in this work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks' learning dynamics, emphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose Continual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the concept of Continual Learning (CL), Representation Learning (RL), and Knowledge Distillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain adaptation tasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets, while effectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student model setting. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method is efficient at domain adaptation to detect low-quality deepfakes videos and GAN-generated images from several datasets, outperforming the-state-of-art baseline methods.},

abstract = {In mixed-initiative user interactions, a user and an autonomous agent collaborate for solving tasks by taking interleaving actions. However, this shift of control towards the agent requires a formation of trust for the user, otherwise the assistance possibly will be rejected and becomes obsolete. One approach for fostering a trustworthy interaction is to equip an agent with proactive dialogue capabilities. However, the development of adequate proactive dialogue strategies is complex and highly user- as well as context-dependent. Inappropriate usage of proactive conversation may even do more harm than good and corrupt the human-computer trust relationship. In order to alleviate this problem, modelling and predicting a proactive system’s perceived trustworthiness during an ongoing interaction is essential. Therefore, this paper presents novel work on the development of a user model for live prediction of trust during proactive interaction, incorporating user-, system-, and context-dependent features. For predicting trust, three machine-learning algorithms – support vector machine, eXtreme Gradient Boost, gated recurrent unit network – are trained and tested on a proactive dialogue corpus. The experimental results show that among the classifiers the support vector machine showed the most well-rounded performance, while the gated recurrent unit had the best accuracy. The results prove the developed user model to be reliable for predicting trust in proactive dialogue. Based on the outcomes, the usability of the proposed method in real-life scenarios is discussed and implications for developing user-adaptive proactive dialogue strategies are described.},

abstract = {Knowledge Distillation (KD), which transfers the knowledge of a well-trained large model (teacher) to a small model (student), has become an important area of research for practical deployment of recommender systems. Recently, Relaxed Ranking Distillation (RRD) has shown that distilling the ranking information in the recommendation list significantly improves the performance. However, the method still has limitations in that 1) it does not fully utilize the prediction errors of the student model, which makes the training not fully efficient, and 2) it only distills the user-side ranking information, which provides an insufficient view under the sparse implicit feedback. This paper presents Dual Correction strategy for Distillation (DCD), which transfers the ranking information from the teacher model to the student model in a more efficient manner. Most importantly, DCD uses the discrepancy between the teacher model and the student model predictions to decide which knowledge to be distilled. By doing so, DCD essentially provides the learning guidance tailored to "correcting" what the student model has failed to accurately predict. This process is applied for transferring the ranking information from the user-side as well as the item-side to address sparse implicit user feedback. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component.},

abstract = {Personalized search plays a crucial role in improving user search experience owing to its ability to build user profiles based on historical behaviors. Previous studies have made great progress in extracting personal signals from the query log and learning user representations. However, neural personalized search is extremely dependent on sufficient data to train the user model. Data sparsity is an inevitable challenge for existing methods to learn high-quality user representations. Moreover, the overemphasis on final ranking quality leads to rough data representations and impairs the generalizability of the model. To tackle these issues, we propose a Personalized Search framework with Self-supervised Learning (PSSL) to enhance data representations. Specifically, we adopt a contrastive sampling method to extract paired self-supervised information from sequences of user behaviors in query logs. Four auxiliary tasks are designed to pre-train the sentence encoder and the sequence encoder used in the ranking model. They are optimized by contrastive loss which aims to close the distance between similar user sequences, queries, and documents. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our proposed model PSSL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing baselines.},

Existing differentiable soft-body simulators can be classified into two categories based on their time integration methods: Simulators using explicit timestepping schemes require tiny timesteps to avoid numerical instabilities in gradient computation, and simulators using implicit time integration typically compute gradients by employing the adjoint method and solving the expensive linearized dynamics. Inspired by Projective Dynamics (PD), we present Differentiable Projective Dynamics (DiffPD), an efficient differentiable soft-body simulator based on PD with implicit time integration. The key idea in DiffPD is to speed up backpropagation by exploiting the prefactorized Cholesky decomposition in forward PD simulation. In terms of contact handling, DiffPD supports two types of contacts: a penalty-based model describing contact and friction forces and a complementarity-based model enforcing non-penetration conditions and static friction. We evaluate the performance of DiffPD and observe it is 4–19 times faster compared with the standard Newton’s method in various applications including system identification, inverse design problems, trajectory optimization, and closed-loop control. We also apply DiffPD in a reality-to-simulation (real-to-sim) example with contact and collisions and show its capability of reconstructing a digital twin of real-world scenes.},

However, the underlying neural architectures require a large amount of parameters to train and suffer from high online inference latency, that is several model parameters have to be updated when new data arrive online. In this study we propose Distill2Vec, a knowledge distillation strategy to train a compact model with a low number of trainable parameters, so as to reduce the latency of online inference and maintain the model accuracy high. We design a distillation loss function based on Kullback-Leibler divergence to transfer the acquired knowledge from a teacher model trained on offline data, to a small-size student model for online data. Our experiments with publicly available datasets show the superiority of our proposed model over several state-of-the-art approaches with relative gains up to 5\% in the link prediction task. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our knowledge distillation strategy, in terms of number of required parameters, where Distill2Vec achieves a compression ratio up to 7:100 when compared with baseline approaches.

abstract = {Nuclei segmentation is an essential step in DNA ploidy analysis by image-based cytometry (DNA-ICM) which is widely used in cytopathology and allows an objective measurement of DNA content (ploidy). The routine fully supervised learning-based method requires often tedious and expensive pixel-wise labels. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised nuclei segmentation framework which exploits only sparsely annotated bounding boxes, without any segmentation labels. The key is to integrate the traditional image segmentation and self-training into fully supervised instance segmentation. We first leverage the traditional segmentation to generate coarse masks for each box-annotated nucleus to supervise the training of a teacher model, which is then responsible for both the refinement of these coarse masks and pseudo labels generation of unlabeled nuclei. These pseudo labels and refined masks along with the original manually annotated bounding boxes jointly supervise the training of student model. Both teacher and student share the same architecture and especially the student is initialized by the teacher. We have extensively evaluated our method with both our DNA-ICM dataset and public cytopathological dataset. Without bells and whistles, our method outperforms all existing weakly supervised entries on both datasets. Code and our DNA-ICM dataset are publicly available at &lt;uri&gt;https://github.com/CVIU-CSU/Weakly-Supervised-Nuclei-Segmentation&lt;/uri&gt;.},

abstract = {Modern businesses are being subjected to an unprecedented variety of change drivers that cannot be predicted such as new regulations, emerging business models, and changing needs of stakeholders. This creates new demands on enterprises to meet stated goals in a dynamic and uncertain environment that translate to demands on the enterprise’s software systems. Software systems however are currently designed to deliver a fixed set of goals and assumed to operate in a static environment, falling short in addressing the need for continuous adaptation under uncertainty. State-of-the-art adaptation architectures like MAPE-K have been applied to meeting non-functional requirements in a dynamic environment using a static repository of knowledge. This paper articulates the need for architecting software systems that learn from their own operation to dynamically extend existing knowledge, and utilize the knowledge to meet stated functional goals in an uncertain environment.},

abstract = {With rapid advancements in Cyber-Physical manufacturing, the Internet of Things, Simulation software, and Machine Learning algorithms, the applicability of Industry 4.0 is gaining momentum. The demand for real-time decision-making in the manufacturing industry has given significant attention to the field of Digital Twin (DT). The whole idea revolves around creating a digital counterpart of the physical system based on enterprise data to exploit the effects of numerous parameters and make informed decisions. Based on that, this paper proposes a simulation-optimization framework for the DT model of a Beverage Manufacturing Plant. A data-driven simulation model developed in Simio is integrated with Python to perform Multi-Objective optimization. The framework explores optimal solutions by simulating multiple scenarios by altering the availability of operators and dispatching/scheduling rules. The results show that simulation optimization can be integrated into the Digital-Twin models as part of real-time production planning and scheduling.},

abstract = {Over the years, AIT has begun to present to people's lives, making people's lives more comfortable. With the progress of intelligent scientific method, online education is developing in the field of education. In the face of the pandemic, millions of students around the world have turned to online education platforms to learn. This paper takes English teachers and students as examples to study the innovation and development of online education. This paper compares the influence of new teachers and students through experiential models and traditional teaching models, and focuses on analyzing the benefits of reformed advanced technologies for online English teachers and students. The results showed that 67\% of the students in the experimental group were satisfied or very satisfied with the new teacher-student model, while only 46\% of the students in the control group were satisfied or very satisfied with the traditional teaching model. Artificial intelligence scientific method (AIT) can promote the reform platform of Online English education.},

year = {2022},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Due to lifestyle changes caused by COVID-19 and other factors, the importance of gaming platforms that allow users to play together with distant friends and family members is increasing. In general, it is difficult for users with widely different gaming skills to play together. Therefore, game designers need to take asymmetry into account, such as providing different roles and different operation interfaces for each user. In this study, we propose a foundation for an asymmetric tele-gaming platform using mobile robots and their digital twins. Then, we conducted an experiment to evaluate the usability of this platform. As a result, we found that the visual size of the digital twin may affect the usability. Based on these results, we propose a model of the relationship between the size of the digital twin and the usability perceived by the user.},
