abstract = {Digital twin technology has revolutionized the state-of-the-art practice in many industries, and digital twins have a natural application to modeling cancer patients. By simulating patients at a more fundamental level than conventional machine learning models, digital twins can provide unique insights by predicting each patient's outcome trajectory. This has numerous associated benefits, including patient-specific clinical decision-making support and the potential for large-scale virtual clinical trials. Historically, it has not been feasible to use digital twin technology to model cancer patients because of the large number of variables that impact each patient's outcome trajectory, including genotypic, phenotypic, social, and environmental factors. However, the path to digital twins in radiation oncology is becoming possible due to recent progress, such as multiscale modeling techniques that estimate patient-specific cellular, molecular, and histological distributions, and modern cryptographic techniques that enable secure and efficient centralization of patient data across multiple institutions. With these and other future scientific advances, digital twins for radiation oncology will likely become feasible. This work discusses the likely generalized architecture of patient-specific digital twins and digital twin networks, as well as the benefits, existing barriers, and potential gateways to the application of digital twin technology in radiation oncology.},

abstract = {Recent recommender systems have shown remarkable performance by using an ensemble of heterogeneous models. However, it is exceedingly costly because it requires resources and inference latency proportional to the number of models, which remains the bottleneck for production. Our work aims to transfer the ensemble knowledge of heterogeneous teachers to a lightweight student model using knowledge distillation (KD), to reduce the huge inference costs while retaining high accuracy. Through an empirical study, we find that the efficacy of distillation severely drops when transferring knowledge from heterogeneous teachers. Nevertheless, we show that an important signal to ease the difficulty can be obtained from the teacher’s training trajectory. This paper proposes a new KD framework, named HetComp, that guides the student model by transferring easy-to-hard sequences of knowledge generated from the teachers’ trajectories. To provide guidance according to the student’s learning state, HetComp uses dynamic knowledge construction to provide progressively difficult ranking knowledge and adaptive knowledge transfer to gradually transfer finer-grained ranking information. Our comprehensive experiments show that HetComp significantly improves the distillation quality and the generalization of the student model.},

abstract = {Market sentiment analysis on social media content requires knowledge of both financial markets and social media jargon, which makes it a challenging task for human raters. The resulting lack of high-quality labeled data stands in the way of conventional supervised learning methods. In this work, we conduct a case study approaching this problem with semi-supervised learning using a large language model (LLM). We select Reddit as the target social media platform due to its broad coverage of topics and content types. Our pipeline first generates weak financial sentiment labels for Reddit posts with an LLM and then uses that data to train a small model that can be served in production. We find that prompting the LLM to produce Chain-of-Thought summaries and forcing it through several reasoning paths helps generate more stable and accurate labels, while training the student model using a regression loss further improves distillation quality. With only a handful of prompts, the final model performs on par with existing supervised models. Though production applications of our model are limited by ethical considerations, the model’s competitive performance points to the great potential of using LLMs for tasks that otherwise require skill-intensive annotation.},

As an important application direction of personalized learning system, learning resource recommendation is used to solve the problems of "information overload" and "information maze" caused by massive learning resources. This paper first constructs learner profile data based on learners' learning behavior, and uses GA-K-means algorithm to cluster learners according to the characteristic data of learner model, which effectively solves the cold start problem caused by untimely resource scoring. Finally, a learning resource recommendation method is designed from the three dimensions of consolidation, promotion and expansion, and N resources with the highest degree of fit are recommended to learners. The experimental results show that GA-K-means algorithm is significantly better than the traditional K-means clustering algorithm in stability and effectiveness, and the classification of learner groups is also in line with the actual situation, which can recommend personalized learning resources that meet the cognitive level for students.},

abstract = {Unsupervised cross-modal hashing (UCMH) has attracted increasing research due to its efficient retrieval performance and label irrelevance. However, existing methods have some bottlenecks: Firstly, the existing unsupervised methods suffer from inaccurate similarity measures due to the lack of correlation between features of different modalities and simple features cannot fully describe the fine-grained relationships of multi-modal data. Secondly, existing methods have rarely explored vision-language knowledge distillation schemes to distil multi-modal knowledge of these vision-language models to guide the learning of student networks. To address these bottlenecks, this paper proposes an effective unsupervised cross-modal hashing retrieval method, called Vision-Language Knowledge Distillation for Unsupervised Cross-Modal Hashing Retrieval (VLKD). VLKD uses the vision-language pre-training (VLP) model to encode features on multi-modal data, and then constructs a similarity matrix to provide soft similarity supervision for the student model. It distils the knowledge of the VLP model to the student model to gain an understanding of multi-modal knowledge. In addition, we designed an end-to-end unsupervised hashing learning model that incorporates a graph convolutional auxiliary network. The auxiliary network aggregates information from similar data nodes based on the similarity matrix distilled by the teacher model to generate more consistent hash codes. Finally, the teacher network does not require additional training, it only needs to guide the student network to learn high-quality hash representation, and VLKD is quite efficient in training and retrieval. Sufficient experiments on three multimedia retrieval benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves better retrieval performance compared to existing unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) is a task that learns semantic knowledge and embedding extraction to retrieve similar images using a sketch without any training examples of unseen classes. Existing methods have attempted to address the modal and semantic gaps in ZS-SBIR by using various strategies such as leveraging category linguistic information for improved discriminability and utilizing knowledge distillation to increase the model’s generalizability towards unseen classes. However, these methods fail to consider the importance of discriminability and generalizability in a unified manner. To address this, we propose a novel method called Adaptive Balanced Discriminability and Generalizability (ABDG) for ZS-SBIR. Specifically, our ABDG method utilizes an advanced two-stage knowledge distillation scheme to balance the learning of discriminability and generalizability for each instance. In addition to task-agnostic teacher models to preserve structural information used in existing work, we introduce a task-specific teacher model pre-trained with a classification objective function to emphasize the discriminability property during knowledge distillation. We also employ a novel entropy-based weighting strategy to balance the effects of structural information preservation and classification losses specific to the classification progress of each instance. Furthermore, we use fine-grained semantic relevance to refine the ego predictions of the student model, with the aim of improving its performance as the training objective continues to converge. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets of ZS-SBIR demonstrate that our ABDG method establishes a state-of-the-art performance by balancing the learning of discriminative and generalizable properties.},

abstract = {Knowledge Transfer has received much attention for its ability to transfer knowledge, rather than data, from one application task to another. In order to comply with the stringent data privacy regulations, privacy-preserving knowledge transfer is highly desirable. The Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) scheme is one promising approach to address this privacy concern while supporting knowledge transfer from an ensemble of "teacher" models to a "student" model under the coordination of an aggregator. To further protect the data privacy of the student node, the privacy-enhanced version of PATE makes use of cryptographic techniques at the expense of heavy computation overheads at the teacher nodes. However, this inevitably hinders the adoption of knowledge transfer due to the highly disparate computational capability of teachers. Besides, in real-life systems, participating teachers may drop out of the system at any time, which causes new security risks for adopted cryptographic building blocks. Thus, it is desirable to devise privacy-enhanced knowledge transfer that can run on teacher nodes with relatively fewer computational resources and can preserve privacy with dropped teacher nodes. In this connection, we propose a dropout-resilient and privacy-enhanced knowledge transfer scheme, Collaborative Split learning over Teacher Ensembles (CSTE), that supports the participating teacher nodes to train and infer their local models using split learning. CSTE not only allows the compute-intensive processing to be performed at a split learning server, but also protects the data privacy of teacher nodes from collusion between the student node and aggregator. Experimental results showed that CSTE achieves significant efficiency improvement from existing schemes.},

Due to their size and complexity, existing approaches have a limited range of applications. In order to decrease inference delay, knowledge distillation techniques have been used in recommendation systems. Due to the student model's lower capacity, the knowledge distillation process is less effective when there is a significant difference in the complexity of the network architecture between the teacher model and the student model.We present a novel knowledge distillation approach called Bridge-based Knowledge Distillation (BKD), which employs a bridge model to facilitate the student model's learning from the teacher model's latent representations. The bridge model is based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and leverages the edges of GNNs to identify significant feature interaction relationships, while simultaneously reducing redundancy for improved efficiency. To further enhance the efficiency of knowledge distillation, we decoupled the extracted knowledge and transferred each component separately to the student model, aiming to improve the distillation sufficiency of each module. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed BKD approach outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on various tasks.},

abstract = {Bundle recommendation aims to recommend a bundle of items to users as a whole with user-bundle (U-B) interaction information, and auxiliary user-item (U-I) interaction and bundle-item affiliation information. Recent methods usually use two graph neural networks (GNNs) to model user's bundle preferences separately from the U-B graph (bundle view) and U-I graph (item view). However, by conducting statistical analysis, we find that the auxiliary U-I information is far underexplored due to the following reasons: 1) Loosely combining the predicted results cannot well synthesize the knowledge from both views. 2) The local U-B and U-I collaborative relations might not be consistent, leading to GNN's inaccurate modeling of user's bundle preference from the U-I graph. 3) The U-I interactions are usually modeled equally while the significant ones corresponding to user's bundle preference are less emphasized.Based on these analyses, we propose a Distillation-enhanced Graph Masked AutoEncoder (DGMAE) for bundle recommendation. Our framework extracts the knowledge of first- and higher-order U-B relations from the U-B graph and injects it into a well-designed graph masked autoencoder (student model). The student model is built with two key designs to jointly capture significant local and global U-I relations from the U-I graph. In specific, we design a transformer-enhanced GNN encoder for global relation learning, which increases the model's representational power of depicting user's bundle preferences. Meanwhile, an adaptive edge masking strategy and reconstruction target are designed on the significant U-I edges to guide the student model to identify the potential ones suggesting user's bundle preferences. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the significant improvements of DGMAE over the SOTA methods.},

abstract = {Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based models have become the mainstream approach for recommender systems. Despite the effectiveness, they are still suffering from the cold-start problem, i.e., recommend for few-interaction items. Existing GNN-based recommendation models to address the cold-start problem mainly focus on utilizing auxiliary features of users and items, leaving the user-item interactions under-utilized. However, embeddings distributions of cold and warm items are still largely different, since cold items' embeddings are learned from lower-popularity interactions, while warm items' embeddings are from higher-popularity interactions. Thus, there is a seesaw phenomenon, where the recommendation performance for the cold and warm items cannot be improved simultaneously. To this end, we proposed a Uncertainty-aware Consistency learning framework for Cold-start item recommendation (shorten as UCC) solely based on user-item interactions. Under this framework, we train the teacher model (generator) and student model (recommender) with consistency learning, to ensure the cold items with additionally generated low-uncertainty interactions can have similar distribution with the warm items. Therefore, the proposed framework improves the recommendation of cold and warm items at the same time, without hurting any one of them. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both warm and cold items, with an average performance improvement of 27.6\%.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is critical to ensure the security of cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, due to the increasing complexity of attacks and CPS themselves, anomaly detection in CPS is becoming more and more challenging. In our previous work, we proposed a digital twin-based anomaly detection method, called ATTAIN, which takes advantage of both historical and real-time data of CPS. However, such data vary significantly in terms of difficulty. Therefore, similar to human learning processes, deep learning models (e.g., ATTAIN) can benefit from an easy-to-difficult curriculum. To this end, in this paper, we present a novel approach, named digitaL twin-based Anomaly deTecTion wIth Curriculum lEarning (LATTICE), which extends ATTAIN by introducing curriculum learning to optimize its learning paradigm. LATTICE attributes each sample with a difficulty score, before being fed into a training scheduler. The training scheduler samples batches of training data based on these difficulty scores such that learning from easy to difficult data can be performed. To evaluate LATTICE, we use five publicly available datasets collected from five real-world CPS testbeds. We compare LATTICE with ATTAIN and two other state-of-the-art anomaly detectors. Evaluation results show that LATTICE outperforms the three baselines and ATTAIN by 0.906\%-2.367\% in terms of the F1 score. LATTICE also, on average, reduces the training time of ATTAIN by 4.2\% on the five datasets and is on par with the baselines in terms of detection delay time.},

abstract = {Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm consisting of local model training, global model aggregation, and global model distribution. Recent research found that model aggregation can reveal the participants’ privacy. To preserve the participants’ privacy, multi-party computation-based secure aggregation is used in federated learning with mobile device participants. The character of the mobile device requires that secure aggregation can be efficient in computation and robust to the dropout. However, prior works need multi rounds, increase computation cost related to the dropped participants, and fails to resist quantum attacks. To solve these issues, we propose a 3-round post-quantum secure protocol for federated learning. In the proposed protocol, single-masking generated by homomorphic Pseudorandom Generator based on learning with round encrypts single user's model. After all the encrypted models are aggregated fast, additively homomorphic decryption based on Shamir secret share guarantee the robustness and performance induced by the dropped participants. All message exchange is based on a post-quantum secure channel constructed with the first post-quantum cryptography standard, Kyber KEM. In post-quantum security, security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can preserve privacy under the sem-honest adversaries setting, and the experimental results show higher running time efficiency.},

This can benefit the drug development process by reducing the sample size required for participant recruitment, improving patient outcome predictive modeling, and mitigating privacy risks when sharing synthetic clinical trial data. However, prior research has mainly focused on generating Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs), which often assume large training data and do not account for personalized synthetic patient record generation. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient method TWIN for generating personalized clinical trial digital twins. TWIN can produce digital twins of patient-level clinical trial records with high fidelity to the targeting participant's record and preserves the temporal relations across visits and events. We compare our method with various baselines for generating real-world patient-level clinical trial data. The results show that TWIN generates synthetic trial data with high fidelity to facilitate patient outcome predictions in low-data scenarios and strong privacy protection against real patients from the trials.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the "joint pre-training and local re-training'' framework for learning and applying multi-source knowledge graph (KG) embeddings. We are motivated by the fact that different KGs contain complementary information to improve KG embeddings and downstream tasks. We pre-train a large teacher KG embedding model over linked multi-source KGs and distill knowledge to train a student model for a task-specific KG. To enable knowledge transfer across different KGs, we use entity alignment to build a linked subgraph for connecting the pre-trained KGs and the target KG. The linked subgraph is re-trained for three-level knowledge distillation from the teacher to the student, i.e., feature knowledge distillation, network knowledge distillation, and prediction knowledge distillation, to generate more expressive embeddings. The teacher model can be reused for different target KGs and tasks without having to train from scratch. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.},

abstract = {News recommendation is essential for personalized news distribution. Federated news recommendation, which enables collaborative model learning from multiple clients without sharing their raw data, is a promising approach for preserving users' privacy. However, the security of federated news recommendation is still unclear. In this paper, we study this problem by proposing an untargeted attack on federated news recommendation called UA-FedRec. By exploiting the prior knowledge of news recommendation and federated learning, UA-FedRec can effectively degrade the model performance with a small percentage of malicious clients. First, the effectiveness of news recommendation highly depends on user modeling and news modeling. We design a news similarity perturbation method to make representations of similar news farther and those of dissimilar news closer to interrupt news modeling, and propose a user model perturbation method to make malicious user updates in opposite directions of benign updates to interrupt user modeling. Second, updates from different clients are typically aggregated with a weighted average based on their sample sizes. We propose a quantity perturbation method to enlarge sample sizes of malicious clients in a reasonable range to amplify the impact of malicious updates. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that UA-FedRec can effectively degrade the accuracy of existing federated news recommendation methods, even when defense is applied. Our study reveals a critical security issue in existing federated news recommendation systems and calls for research efforts to address the issue.

abstract = {Human Digital Twin (HDT) is a powerful tool to create a virtual replica of a human, to be used for example for designing interactions with physical systems, preventing cognitive overload, managing human capital, and maintaining a healthy and motivated workforce. Building human twins is a challenging task due to the need to reliably represent each corresponding human being, and the fact that human beings notably differ from each other. Therefore, relying solely on expert knowledge is insufficient, and human twins must learn the specifics of each individual in order to accurately represent them. This paper focuses on AI methods for modelling the mental wellbeing of knowledge workers because the mounting cognitive demands of both white-collar and blue-collar work lead to employees’ stress, and stress leads to diminished creativity and motivation, increased sick leaves, and in severe cases, accidents, burnouts, and disabilities. This paper describes the main building blocks of AI-based detectors of mental stress and highlights the main challenges and future directions of research., which are expected to be relevant also for HDT learning in other domains because the high degree of individuality is ubiquitous in all human activities.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) learns a global model in a distributional manner, which does not require local clients to share private data. Such merit has drawn lots of attention in the interaction scenarios, where Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) emerges as a cross-field research direction focusing on the robust training of agents. Different from FL, the heterogeneity problem in FRL is more challenging because the data depends on the policy of agents and the environment dynamics. FRL learns to interact under the non-stationary environment feedback, while the typical FL methods aim at handling the constant data heterogeneity. In this article, we are among the first attempts to analyze the heterogeneity problem in FRL and propose an off-policy FRL framework. Specifically, a student–teacher–student model learning and fusion method, termed as Server-Client Collaborative Distillation (SCCD), is introduced. Unlike the traditional FL, we distill all local models on the server side for model fusion. To reduce the variance of the training, a local distillation is also conducted every time the agent receives the global model. Experimentally, we compare SCCD with a range of straightforward combinations between FL methods and RL. The results demonstrate that SCCD has a superior performance in four classical continuous control tasks with non-IID environments.},

abstract = {While personalization increases the utility of recommender systems, it also brings the issue of filter bubbles. e.g., if the system keeps exposing and recommending the items that the user is interested in, it may also make the user feel bored and less satisfied. Existing work studies filter bubbles in static recommendation, where the effect of overexposure is hard to capture. In contrast, we believe it is more meaningful to study the issue in interactive recommendation and optimize long-term user satisfaction. Nevertheless, it is unrealistic to train the model online due to the high cost. As such, we have to leverage offline training data and disentangle the causal effect on user satisfaction. To achieve this goal, we propose a counterfactual interactive recommender system (CIRS) that augments offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with causal inference. The basic idea is to first learn a causal user model on historical data to capture the overexposure effect of items on user satisfaction. It then uses the learned causal user model to help the planning of the RL policy. To conduct evaluation offline, we innovatively create an authentic RL environment (KuaiEnv) based on a real-world fully observed user rating dataset. The experiments show the effectiveness of CIRS in bursting filter bubbles and achieving long-term success in interactive recommendation. The implementation of CIRS is available via https://github.com/chongminggao/ CIRS-codes.},

Smart service can be defined as a service conveyed using intelligent products that possess awareness and connectivity. All kinds of smart services can be connected in smart cities to offer citizens comprehensive solutions. Pre-emptive services, self-services, or highly interactive services, for example, have the potential to be implemented using current technology such as the internet of things, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, big data, machine learning, machine-to-machine communications, and the digital twin. Therefore, there is scope for research and implementation of other technology for smart services in the future.},

abstract = {In the present era of advanced technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling smart connected environments. This includes various domains such as smart homes, smart healthcare, smart cities, smart vehicles, and many others. The IoT facilitates the integration and interconnection of devices, enabling them to communicate, share data, and work together to create intelligent and efficient systems. With ubiquitous smart connected devices and systems, a large amount of data associated with them is at a prime risk from malicious entities (e.g., users, devices, applications) in these systems. Innovative technologies, including cloud computing, Machine Learning (ML), and data analytics, support the development of anomaly detection models for the Vehicular Internet of Things (V-IoT), which encompasses collaborative automatic driving and enhanced transportation systems. However, traditional centralized anomaly detection models fail to provide better services for connected vehicles due to issues such as high latency, privacy leakage, performance overhead, and model drift.Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant recognition for its ability to address data privacy concerns in the IoT domain. In the context of V-IoT, which involves autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems with connected vehicles communicating with various sensors and devices, FL is used to develop an anomaly detection model. Current technology, the Digital Twin (DT), proves beneficial in addressing uncertain crises and data security issues by creating a virtual replica that simulates various factors, including traffic trajectories, city policies, and vehicle utilization. This enables the system to facilitate efficient and inclusive decision-making. However, the effectiveness of a V-IoT DT system heavily relies on the collection of long-term and high-quality data to make appropriate decisions. Consequently, its advantages may be limited when confronted with urgent crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.This paper introduces a Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) based anomaly detection model for V-IoT, aiming to enhance the accuracy of the model. Our proposed model integrates both DT and HFL approaches to create a comprehensive system for detecting malicious activities using an anomaly detection model. Additionally, real-world V-IoT use case scenarios are presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed model.},

We report using a reinforcement learning (RL) model for customary vessel parameters when training with subject-specific pressure and flow waveforms. We use an equivalent electric-circuit model for the human arteries and adjust the values of resistors, inductors, and capacitors in combination with reinforcement learning (RL). The conceived model stems as a digital twin replicating specific subjects.

To achieve these goals, we propose an imperfect surrogate user model for AAC system design and evaluation, develop a dedicated machine learning language model for AAC purposes, and design an AI-driven text entry system Tinkerable AAC (TAAC) which is ready for user testing.

abstract = {Knowledge distillation (KD) is a powerful and widely applicable technique for the compression of deep learning models. The main idea of knowledge distillation is to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a small student model, where the attention mechanism has been intensively explored in regard to its great flexibility for managing different teacher-student architectures. However, existing attention-based methods usually transfer similar attention knowledge from the intermediate layers of deep neural networks, leaving the hierarchical structure of deep representation learning poorly investigated for knowledge distillation. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical multi-attention transfer framework (HMAT), where different types of attention are utilized to transfer the knowledge at different levels of deep representation learning for knowledge distillation. Specifically, position-based and channel-based attention knowledge characterize the knowledge from low-level and high-level feature representations, respectively, and activation-based attention knowledge characterize the knowledge from both mid-level and high-level feature representations. Extensive experiments on three popular visual recognition tasks, image classification, image retrieval, and object detection, demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical multi-attention transfer or HMAT significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art KD methods.},

This is even more important when considering systems, such as nautical and aerial fleet radars, in which incumbent radios operate mission-critical communication links. To study, develop, and validate these solutions, adequate platforms, such as the Colosseum wireless network emulator, are key as they enable experimentation with spectrum-sharing heterogeneous radio technologies in controlled environments. In this work, we demonstrate how Colosseum can be used to twin commercial radio waveforms to evaluate the coexistence of such technologies in complex wireless propagation environments. To this aim, we create a high-fidelity spectrum-sharing scenario on Colosseum to evaluate the impact of twinned commercial radar waveforms on a cellular network operating in the CBRS band. Then, we leverage IQ samples collected on the testbed to train a machine learning agent that runs at the base station to detect the presence of incumbent radar transmissions and vacate the bandwidth to avoid causing them harmful interference. Our results show an average detection accuracy of 88\%, with accuracy above 90\% in SNR regimes above 0 dB and SINR regimes above --20 dB, and with an average detection time of 137 ms.},

abstract = {Nursing records, rich in free-text data, encapsulate valuable insights into patients' physiological status and physicians' diagnoses, offering more holistic perspectives than mere tabular data. The scrutiny of these free-text descriptions often enables physicians to rapidly assimilate the patients' historical and current health states, thereby facilitating accurate diagnosis and treatment. One particularly pressing issue is the identification of intra-dialytic hypotension (IDH) symptoms within these records. IDH, a sporadic yet potentially fatal complication during hemodialysis sessions for end-stage kidney disease patients, is diagnosed by a decrease of 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure during hemodialysis or a drop of 10 mmHg in mean arterial pressure coupled with hypo-perfusion-related symptoms. In response to this, we have meticulously developed a Multi-modality-aware IDH Classifier (MMIDHC) using a natural language processing (NLP) model aimed at the classification of these records. Primarily, this model focuses on the classification of English-Chinese bilingual dialysis records concerning IDH. Composed of three distinct modules, the model's intricate processes are delineated in Figure 1.Free-text Pre-processing: To investigate the influence of long sentences and noise on classification, we implemented sentence segmentation. Additionally, we enhanced the contextual relationships and augmented the sample size by merging adjacent segments in both antegrade and retrograde fashions, as context ordered-shuffling.Free-text Feature Extraction: To expedite the process and avoid the need to rebuild NLP models, we adopted publicly available NLP models that support the Chinese language for feature extraction. In this context, we utilized the Multilingual Universal Sentence Encoder (mUSE) proposed by Yang et al. [3] and the Multilingual Sentence BERT (mSBERT) introduced by Reimers et al. [2]. The latter model builds upon Sentence BERT (SBERT) [1] and incorporates the Teacher-Student Model. Both these multilingual NLP models serve as encoders, parsing free-text, and converting natural language into feature vectors. The performance of these models, in terms of metric indicators, showed minimal differences at a fixed threshold. Nevertheless, the mSBERT encoder consistently outperformed mUSE in speed, approximately 20 times faster. Given the potential impact of encoder speed on the operation of the multimodule model, we selected mSBERT as the primary encoder.Classification Learning: We employed a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for classifying the extracted features. In order to improve the reliability of our classification, we incorporated the MLP's Intradialytic Hypotension (IDH) results with the blood pressure readings from the ongoing dialysis session into an ensemble model. This method facilitates more nuanced decision-making. For example, if the MLP detects IDH symptoms (Yes), but the blood pressure reading is normal (False), we classify the result as False owing to lack of fulfilling definition of IDH. However, if both the MLP and the blood pressure readings suggest a normal state, we categorize the dialysis record as Non-IDH. Our baseline model has achieved encouraging results across all metrics: Accuracy 0.951, Recall 0.955, Precision 0.913, and F1-score 0.932.

In our approach, we consider buildings in which a network of heterogeneous sensors in each spatial unit records key properties such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration, as well as energy consumption and solar energy production. The continuously collected sensor data forms a spatio-temporal data space, which is used by the digital twin as a basis for AI-based analyses and simulations. The transfer of time-series data in near real time can be done by different databases. Analysis techniques focusing on time-series data allow for targeted access to the information and support the identification of exceptional events, recurring patterns, and the comparison of energy and climate-related performance. A prototype of an energy- and climate-oriented digital twin is currently being implemented in a government project in Andalusia, Spain, covering about 430 public buildings.},

abstract = {This paper introduces an unsupervised model for audio-visual localization, which aims to identify regions in the visual data that produce sounds. Our key technical contribution is to demonstrate that using distilled prior knowledge of both sounds and objects in an unsupervised learning phase can improve performance significantly. We propose an Audio-Visual Correspondence (AVC) model consisting of an audio and a vision student, which are respectively supervised by an audio teacher (audio recognition model) and a vision teacher (object detection model). Leveraging a contrastive learning approach, the AVC student model extracts features from sounds and images and computes a localization map, discovering the regions of the visual data that correspond to the sound signal. Simultaneously, the teacher models provide feature-based hints from their last layers to supervise the AVC model in the training phase. In the test phase, the teachers are removed. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-visual localization models on 10k and 144k subsets of the Flickr and VGGS datasets, including cross-dataset validation.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of drug-drug interaction (DDI) is crucial to achieving effective decision-making in medical treatment for both doctors and patients. Recently, many deep learning based methods have been proposed to learn from drug-related features and conduct DDI prediction. These works have achieved promising results. However, the extreme imbalance of medical data poses a serious problem to DDI prediction, where a small fraction of DDI types occupy the majority training data. A straightforward way is to develop an appropriate policy to sample the data. Due to the high complexity and speciality of medical science, a dynamic learnable policy is required instead of a heuristic, uniform or static one. Therefore, we propose a REinforced Student-Teacher curriculum learning model (REST) for effective sampling to tackle this imbalance problem. Specifically, REST consists of two interactive parts, which are a heterogeneous graph neural network as the student and a reinforced sampler as the teacher. In each interaction, the teacher model takes action to sample an appropriate batch to train the student model according to the student model state while the cumulated improvement in performance of the student model is treated as the reward for policy gradient of the teacher model. The experimental results on two benchmarking datasets have demonstrated the significant effectiveness of our proposed model in DDI prediction, especially for the DDI types with low frequency.},

abstract = {Developing realistic and interactive virtual environments is a major hurdle in the progress of Metaverse. At present, majority of Metaverse applications necessitate the manual construction of 3D models which is both time-consuming and costly. Additionally, it is challenging to design environments that can promptly react to users' actions. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach to generate virtual worlds using digital twin (DT) technology and AI through a Text-to-Metaverse pipeline. This pipeline converts natural language input into a scene JSON, which is used to generate a 3D virtual world using two engines: Generative Script Engine (GSE) and Generative Metaverse Engine (GME). GME generates a design script from the JSON file, and then uses it to generate 3D objects in an environment. It aims to use multimodal AI and DT technology to produce realistic and highly detailed virtual environments. The proposed pipeline has potential applications including education, training, architecture, healthcare and entertainment, and could change the way designers and developers create virtual worlds. While this short paper covers an abstract as per the Doctorial Symposium's guidelines, it contributes to the research on generative models for multimodal data and provides a new direction for creating immersive virtual experiences.},

abstract = {Existing few-shot action recognition methods have placed primary focus on improving the recognition accuracy while neglecting another important indicator in practical scenarios, i.e., model efficiency. In this paper, we make the first attempt and propose a Lightweight Multi-modal Knowledge Distillation framework (Lite-MKD) for few-shot action recognition. In this framework, the teacher model conducts multi-modal learning to achieve a comprehensive fusion of the optical flow, depth, and appearance features of human movements, thus achieving a more robust representation of actions. The student model is utilized to learn to recognize actions from the single RGB modality at a lower computational cost under the guidance of the teacher. To fully explore and integrate multi-modal information, a hierarchical Multi-modal Fusion Module (MFM) is introduced in the teacher model. Besides, a multi-level Distinguish-to-Mimic (D2M) knowledge distillation component is proposed for the student model. D2M improves the ability of the student model to mimic the action classification probabilities of the teacher model by enhancing the distinguishability of the student model for different video categories in the support set. Extensive experiments on three action recognition datasets Kinetics, HMDB51, and UCF101 demonstrate our framework's effectiveness and stable generalization ability. With a much more lightweight network for inference, we achieve comparable performance to previous state-of-the-art methods. Our source code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/Lite-MKD},

abstract = {Visual Question Answering (VQA) has achieved significant success over the last few years, while most studies focus on training a VQA model on a stationary domain (e.g., a given dataset). In real-world application scenarios, however, these methods are often inefficient because VQA systems are always supposed to extend their knowledge and meet the ever-changing demands of users. In this paper, we introduce a new and challenging multi-domain lifelong VQA task, dubbed MDL-VQA, which encourages the VQA model to continuously learn across multiple domains while mitigating the forgetting on previously-learned domains. Furthermore, we propose a novel replay-free Self-Critical Distillation (SCD) framework tailor-made for MDL-VQA, which alleviates forgetting issue via transferring previous-domain knowledge from teacher to student models. First, we propose to introspect the teacher's understanding over original and counterfactual samples, thereby creating informative instance-relevant and domain-relevant knowledge for logits-based distillation. Second, on the side of feature-based distillation, we propose to introspect the reasoning behavior of student model to establish the harmful domain-specific knowledge acquired in current domain, and further leverage the metric learning strategy to encourage student to learn useful knowledge in new domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCD framework outperforms state-of-the-art competitors with different training orders.},

abstract = {Multimodal recommendation exploits the rich multimodal information associated with users or items to enhance the representation learning for better performance. In these methods, end-to-end feature extractors (e.g., shallow/deep neural networks) are often adopted to tailor the generic multimodal features that are extracted from raw data by pre-trained models for recommendation. However, compact extractors, such as shallow neural networks, may find it challenging to extract effective information from complex and high-dimensional generic modality features. Conversely, DNN-based extractors may encounter the data sparsity problem in recommendation. To address this problem, we propose a novel model-agnostic approach called Semantic-guided Feature Distillation (SGFD), which employs a teacher-student framework to extract feature for multimodal recommendation. The teacher model first extracts rich modality features from the generic modality feature by considering both the semantic information of items and the complementary information of multiple modalities. SGFD then utilizes response-based and feature-based distillation loss to effectively transfer the knowledge encoded in the teacher model to the student model. To evaluate the effectiveness of our SGFD, we integrate SGFD into three backbone multimodal recommendation models. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate that SGFD-enhanced models can achieve substantial improvement over their counterparts.},

abstract = {Knowledge distillation is an effective paradigm for boosting the performance of pocket-size model, especially when multiple teacher models are available, the student would break the upper limit again. However, it is not economical to train diverse teacher models for the disposable distillation. In this paper, we introduce a new concept dubbed Avatars for distillation, which are the inference ensemble models derived from the teacher. Concretely, (1) For each iteration of distillation training, various Avatars are generated by a perturbation transformation. We validate that Avatars own higher upper limit of working capacity and teaching ability, aiding the student model in learning diverse and receptive knowledge perspectives from the teacher model. (2) During the distillation, we propose an uncertainty-aware factor from the variance of statistical differences between the vanilla teacher and Avatars, to adjust Avatars' contribution on knowledge transfer adaptively. Avatar Knowledge Distillation (AKD) is fundamentally different from existing methods and refines with the innovative view of unequal training. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our Avatars mechanism, which polishes up the state-of-the-art distillation methods for dense prediction without more extra computational cost. The AKD brings at most 0.7 AP gains on COCO 2017 for Object Detection and 1.83 mIoU gains on Cityscapes for Semantic Segmentation, respectively.},

abstract = {Pseudo-Labeling based semi-supervised learning has shown promising advantages in Scene Text Recognition (STR). Most of them usually use a pre-trained model to generate sequence-level pseudo labels for text images and then re-train the model. Recently, conducting Pseudo-Labeling in a teacher-student framework (a student model is supervised by the pseudo labels from a teacher model) has become increasingly popular, which trains in an end-to-end manner and yields outstanding performance in semi-supervised learning. However, applying this framework directly to Pseudo-Labeling STR exhibits unstable convergence, as generating pseudo labels at the coarse-grained sequence-level leads to inefficient utilization of unlabelled data. Furthermore, the inherent domain shift between labeled and unlabeled data results in low quality of derived pseudo labels. To mitigate the above issues, we propose a novel Cross-domain Pseudo-Labeling (CPL) approach for scene text recognition, which makes better utilization of unlabeled data at the character-level and provides more accurate pseudo labels. Specifically, our proposed Pseudo-Labeled Curriculum Learning dynamically adjusts the thresholds for different character classes according to the model's learning status. Moreover, an Adaptive Distribution Regularizer is employed to bridge the domain gap and improve the quality of pseudo labels. Extensive experiments show that CPL boosts those representative STR models to achieve state-of-the-art results on six challenging STR benchmarks. Besides, it can be effectively generalized to handwritten text.},

abstract = {Masked video modeling has shown remarkable performance in downstream tasks by predicting masked video tokens from visible ones. However, training models from scratch on large-scale unlabeled data remains computationally challenging and time-consuming. Moreover, the commonly used random-based sampling techniques may lead to the selection of redundant or low-information regions, hindering the model from learning discriminative representations within the limited training epochs. To achieve efficient pre-training, we propose MaskAgain, an efficient feature-based knowledge distillation framework for masked video pre-training that facilitates knowledge transfer from a pre-trained teacher model to a student model. In contrast to previous approaches that align all visible token features with the teacher model at output layers, MaskAgain adopts a selective approach by masking visible tokens again at both the hidden and output layers of the transformer block. Attention mechanisms are utilized for informative feature selection. At the hidden level, attention maps generated by the transformer's multi-head attention structure are utilized to select crucial token information at both temporally-global and temporally-local levels. Additionally, at the output level, an activation-based attention map is generated using token features, enabling us to focus on important tokens while preserving feature similarity and the relationship matrix similarity between patches. Extensive experimental results show that MaskAgain achieves comparable or even better performance than existing methods on benchmark datasets with much fewer training epochs and much less memory, which demonstrates that MaskAgain allows for efficient pre-training of accurate video models, reducing computational resources and training time significantly.

abstract = {Point clouds produced by 3D scanning are typically sparse, non-uniform, and noisy. Existing upsampling techniques directly learn the mapping from a sparse point set to a dense point set, which is often under-determined and ill-posed. To reduce the uncertainty and ambiguity of the upsampling mapping, this paper proposes a generic three-stage vector-quantization framework, which incorporates a Codebook lookup Transformer and knowledge distillation for Point Cloud Upsampling, named CPU. The proposed CPU reformulates the upsampling task into a relatively determinate code prediction task within a small, discrete proxy space. Since the traditional vector-quantization methods cannot be directly applied to point cloud upsampling scenarios, we introduce a knowledge distillation training scheme that facilitates efficient codebook learning and ensures full utilization of codebook entries. Specifically, we adopt a teacher-student training paradigm to avoid model collapse during codebook learning. In the first stage, we pre-train a vanilla auto-encoder of the dense point set as the teacher model, which provides rich guidance features to ensure sufficient codebook learning. In the second stage, we train a vector-quantized auto-encoder as a student model to capture high-fidelity geometric priors into a learned codebook with the aid of distillation. In the third stage, we propose a Codebook Lookup Transformer to model the global context of the sparse point set and predict the code indices. Then the coarse features of the sparse point set can be quantized and substituted by looking up the indices in the learned codebook. Benefiting from the expressive codebook priors and the distillation training scheme, the proposed CPU outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.},

In contrast to existing methods that suffer from low usability and high mental load, our approach only requires the user to rank images over multiple iterations according to the perceived similarity with their mental image. Based on these rankings, our mental face reconstruction system extracts image features in each iteration, combines them into a joint feature vector, and then uses a generative model to visually reconstruct the mental image. To avoid the need for collecting large amounts of human training data, we further propose a computational user model that can simulate human ranking behaviour using data from an online crowd-sourcing study (N=215). Results from a 12-participant user study show that our method can reconstruct mental images that are visually similar to existing approaches but has significantly higher usability, lower perceived workload, and is faster. In addition, results from a third 22-participant lineup study in which we validated our reconstructions on a face ranking task show a identification rate of , which is in line with prior work. These results represent an important step towards new interactive intelligent systems that can robustly and effortlessly reconstruct a user’s mental image.},

We scale up the fault diagnosis algorithm to the required real-time performance through the use of parallelization and surrogate models of the physics-based digital twin. The prognostics module tracks fault progression and trains the online degradation models to compute remaining useful life of system components. In addition, we use the degradation models to assess the impact of the fault progression on the operational requirements. The reconfiguration module uses PDDL-based planning endowed with semantic attachments to adjust the system controls to minimize the fault impact on the system operation. We define a resilience metric and use a fuel system example to demonstrate how the metric improves with our framework.},

abstract = {Microservices are terraforming the computing landscape with web-scale infrastructures (e.g., Facebook, Google, Amazon) and telecom infrastructures (e.g., ATT, Ericsson) adopting them. At it’s core, the microservices paradigm promotes a decoupling of applications into multiple services – a decoupling that promotes better scalability, fault-tolerance, and deployability. Unfortunately, this decoupling significantly increases the space of configuration options and performance problems, rendering traditional approaches to management ineffective. Recent efforts to address this problem embrace Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps). However, training effective AI models requires significant amounts of data and, in some instances, a framework for quickly exploring or analyzing model performance. Digital twins, or simulators, have effectively enabled AI-based management frameworks within other domains (e.g., manufacturing, industrial and automotive). In this paper, we propose the design of KubeKlone, the first comprehensive and opensource digital twin for modeling cloud-native microservices applications. KubeKlone is motivated by our need for accurate, efficient, and general model training. KubeKlone satisfies these goals by decoupling the simulation of microservices from the training of machine learning (ML) models while simultaneously ensuring efficiency and simplifying model design. In particular, KubeKlone introduces a queue-based simulator that abstracts infrastructure details and focuses on modeling, with queues, resource contentions across host and network components. To simplify model design, KubeKlone provides interfaces that hide simulator details and provides wrappers around popular ML packages. To illustrate the strengths of KubeKlone, we validate it against a deployment on Google Cloud Engine and implement several AIOps resource management algorithms (including PARTIES).},

abstract = {With the remarkable technological development in cyber-physical systems, industry 4.0 has evolved by use of a significant concept named digital twin (DT). However, it is still difficult to construct a relationship between twin simulation and a real scenario considering dynamic variations, especially when dealing with small surface defect detection tasks with high performance and computation resource requirements. In this article, we aim to construct cyber-manufacturing systems to achieve a DT solution for small surface defect detection task. Focusing on DT-based solution, the proposed system consists of an Edge–Cloud architecture and a surface defect detection algorithm. Considering dynamic characteristics and real-time response requirement, Edge–Cloud architecture is built to achieve smart manufacturing by efficiently collecting, processing, analyzing, and storing data produced by factory. A deep learning–based algorithm is then constructed to detect surface defeats based on multi-modal data, i.e., imaging and depth data. Experiments show the proposed algorithm could achieve high accuracy and recall in small defeat detection task, thus constructing DT in cyber-manufacturing.},

abstract = {The Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) collects information on cancer patients by receiving cancer messages from different medical entities (e.g., medical labs, hospitals) in Norway. Such messages are validated by an automated cancer registry system: GURI. Its correct operation is crucial since it lays the foundation for cancer research and provides critical cancer-related statistics to its stakeholders. Constructing a cyber-cyber digital twin (CCDT) for GURI can facilitate various experiments and advanced analyses of the operational state of GURI without requiring intensive interactions with the real system. However, GURI constantly evolves due to novel medical diagnostics and treatment, technological advances, etc. Accordingly, CCDT should evolve as well to synchronize with GURI. A key challenge of achieving such synchronization is that evolving CCDT needs abundant data labelled by the new GURI. To tackle this challenge, we propose EvoCLINICAL, which considers the CCDT developed for the previous version of GURI as the pretrained model and fine-tunes it with the dataset labelled by querying a new GURI version. EvoCLINICAL employs a genetic algorithm to select an optimal subset of cancer messages from a candidate dataset and query GURI with it. We evaluate EvoCLINICAL on three evolution processes. The precision, recall, and F1 score are all greater than 91\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of EvoCLINICAL. Furthermore, we replace the active learning part of EvoCLINICAL with random selection to study the contribution of transfer learning to the overall performance of EvoCLINICAL. Results show that employing active learning in EvoCLINICAL increases its performances consistently.},

Simulation of therapeutic scenarios becomes possible, allowing inference of possible outcomes and providing tools for decision support. Therefore, this research focuses on the design of an AI-augmented digital twin towards adaptive serious-games therapy for people with disabilities (e.g., cerebral palsy, speech disorders, Parkinson’s disease) to provide solutions toward positive therapy results.

In case of linear regression and ridge regression we give an explicit expression for the so defined sensitivity w.r.t. training data and study the properties. Moreover, we discuss the numerical approximation of sensitivity w.r.t. training data for neural networks and provide an application of this numerical approximation to remote sensing in the environmental sciences.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are expected to be assistants that help human users find relevant information automatically without explicit queries. As recommender systems evolve, increasingly sophisticated learning techniques are applied and have achieved better performance in terms of user engagement metrics such as clicks and browsing time. The increase in the measured performance, however, can have two possible attributions: a better understanding of user preferences, and a more proactive ability to utilize human bounded rationality to seduce user over-consumption. A natural following question is whether current recommendation algorithms are manipulating user preferences. If so, can we measure the manipulation level? In this paper, we present a general framework for benchmarking the degree of manipulations of recommendation algorithms, in both slate recommendation and sequential recommendation scenarios. The framework consists of four stages, initial preference calculation, training data collection, algorithm training and interaction, and metrics calculation that involves two proposed metrics, Manipulation Score and Preference Shift. We benchmark some representative recommendation algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets under the proposed framework. We have observed that a high online click-through rate does not necessarily mean a better understanding of user initial preference, but ends in prompting users to choose more documents they initially did not favor. Moreover, we find that the training data have notable impacts on the manipulation degrees, and algorithms with more powerful modeling abilities are more sensitive to such impacts. The experiments also verified the usefulness of the proposed metrics for measuring the degree of manipulations. We advocate that future recommendation algorithm studies should be treated as an optimization problem with constrained user preference manipulations.},
