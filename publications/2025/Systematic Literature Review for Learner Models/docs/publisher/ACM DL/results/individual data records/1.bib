abstract = {An Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) is an educational software that provides personal assistance for students, allowing them to learn at their own pace. This is possible because ITSs are able to map the learners' knowledge to create a student model. Most of the tutors use a Bayesian Network (BN) to perform this task, due to their ability to deal with uncertain data. However, classic static BNs are unable to model data, such as the student's knowledge, that changes over time. Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) are an interesting option in this case, because they are a special type of BN that reasons over time. This paper presents an architecture of DBN that aims at inferring student's algebraic knowledge. This network was constructed based on a concept map, which was developed with the goal of structuring the algebraic knowledge, i. e. defining relationships among concepts. The proposed DBN was evaluated with the help of an expert in order to verify the ability of the network to predict the student's knowledge on the application of operations to solve 1st degree equations. This DBN is being integrated into an web-based ITS for algebra learning.},

abstract = {In Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) systems, students work in groups interacting by using computers. Each member of the team behaves in a particular way to collaborate with others, manifesting a particular learning style. In this paper we propose a new approach for automatically creating student groups in CSCL systems by considering their individual learning styles. Data mining techniques are applied to discover which existent combinations of learning styles lead to a better performance. The discovered knowledge will be used by a software agent to propose the creation of the most promising new groups. The approach also considers the creation and maintenance of a user model for each student and a group model for each team. The assistant agent will be implemented in an existing CSCL tool, and its performance will be validated with real students.},

abstract = {Empirical studies of adaptive annotation in the educational context have demonstrated that it can help students to acquire knowledge faster, improve learning outcomes, reduce navigational overhead, and encourage non-sequential navigation. Over the last 8 years we have explored a lesser known effect of adaptive annotation -- its ability to significantly increase student engagement in working with non-mandatory educational content. In the presence of adaptive link annotation, students tend to access significantly more learning content; they stay with it longer, return to it more often and explore a wider variety of learning resources. This talk will present an overview of our exploration of the addictive links effect in many course-long studies, which we ran in several domains (C, SQL and Java programming), for several types of learning content (quizzes, problems, interactive examples). The first part of the talk will review our exploration of a more traditional knowledge-based personalization approach and the second part will focus on more recent studies of social navigation and open social student modeling.},

abstract = {We propose two methods for exploratory image search systems using gaze data for continuous learning of the users' interests and relevance calculation. The first system uses the fixation time over the images selected by gaze in the search results pages, whereas the second one utilizes the fixation time over the clicked images and fixations over the non-selected images on the results page. A user model is trained and continuously updated from the gaze input throughout the whole session in both systems. We conducted an experiment with 24 users, each performing four search tasks using the proposed systems and compared the results to a baseline system, which does not employ any gaze data. The Gaze feedback system users viewed 22.35\% more images than the users of the baseline system. A high correlation between the number of saved images and the satisfaction with the results was observed in data collected from the users of a mouse feedback system enriched by gaze data. The results show that including the gaze data into the relevance calculation in both cases increases the degree of satisfaction with the search results compared with the baseline.},

abstract = {When a user learns to use a new device, her understanding of it evolves. A progressive comparison of the evolving user models towards the device target model, for analysing learning, involves determining the behavioral proximity between them. To quantify the gap between a user model and a target model, we introduce an edit distance metric for measuring their behavioral proximity using a bisimulation-based equivalence relation. We define edit distance to be the minimum number of edges and states with incident edges required to be deleted from and/or added to a user model to make it bisimilar to the target model. We propose an algorithm to compute edit distance between two models and employ the heuristic procedure on experimental data for computing edit distance between target and user models. The data is organised into two experiments depending on the device the user interacted with: (a) a simple device resembling a vending machine and (b) a close to real-world vehicle transmission model. The results validate our proposed metric as edit distance converges with progressive user learning, increases for erroneous learning, and remains unchanged indicating no learning.},

For these possibilities to unfold, the expertise and collaboration of many specialists will be necessary to improve data collection, to foster the development of better predictive models, and to assure models are interpretable and actionable. The big data collected from MOOCs needs to be bigger, not in its height (number of students) but in its width more meta-data and information on learners' cognitive and self-regulatory states needs to be collected in addition to correctness and completion rates. This more detailed articulation will help open up the black box approach to machine learning models where prediction is the primary goal. Instead, a data-driven learner model approach uses fine grain data that is conceived and developed from cognitive principles to build explanatory models with practical implications to improve student learning.},

There are differences in the properties of each individual such as differences in skills, prior knowledge, ... etc. These characteristics must be measured to display the content that is suitable to individual needs of student. There are different e-assessment models that are appropriate for discovering the prior knowledge and skills. The main objective of this research is to build an e-assessment model for Personal and Intelligent Assessment using Test (PIAT) to facilitate the evaluation process and measure the students' proficiency with more accuracy and store it in the student's profile for later use in the process of adapting content material to individual student needs. On one hand the model can help the instructors to develop the test by determining the objectives, creation and reuse of the test items. On the other hand the model can provide a personal test environment to the student. It generates the appropriate questions in an adaptive way, based on the student's model. The PIAT model is based on two theories. The first theory is Revised Bloom's Taxonomy (RBT) and the second theory is Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM).},

People from different countries have different cultures and interact with the user interface differently, prefer different graphic designs, and have different expectations and behavior patterns. Therefore, the user interface should be adapted to the needs of each geographical location to provide optimal user experience.

abstract = {Multiplayer Serious Games are a promising concept to combine the features of Serious Games with the concept of collaborative learning. Multiplayer games, however, are hard to model, especially as interaction between players is often hard to predict. For the design of multiplayer Serious Games, especially considering adaptation algorithms for multiplayer Serious Games, exhaustive tests are desirable. As real players are often hard to obtain, simulation of players might be a solution. In this paper we propose an approach to simulate human player behavior in collaborative multiplayer Serious Games. Our approach considers behavior in terms of gaming (player model), learning (learner model), and collaboration and teamwork (interaction model). The aim of our model is to have a sound foundation of realistic player behavior as a basis for evaluation of adaptation mechanisms in collaborative multiplayer Serious Games. We implemented our approach as an extension of the collaborative multiplayer Serious Game 'Escape From Wilson Island' and carried out a first evaluation. The results are promising as they indicate that it is possible to soundly and reproducibly simulate player behavior based on a player model, player skills as well as on teamwork and communication.},

abstract = {Evaluating and optimizing an interactive system (like search engines, recommender and advertising systems) from historical data against a predefined online metric is challenging, especially when that metric is computed from user feedback such as clicks and payments. The key challenge is counterfactual in nature: we only observe a user's feedback for actions taken by the system, but we do not know what that user would have reacted to a different action. The golden standard to evaluate such metrics of a user-interacting system is online A/B experiments (a.k.a. randomized controlled experiments), which can be expensive in terms of both time and engineering resources. Offline evaluation/optimization (sometimes referred to as off-policy learning in the literature) thus becomes critical, aiming to evaluate the same metrics without running (many) expensive A/B experiments on live users. One approach to offline evaluation is to build a user model that simulates user behavior (clicks, purchases, etc.) under various contexts, and then evaluate metrics of a system with this simulator. While being straightforward and common in practice, the reliability of such model-based approaches relies heavily on how well the user model is built. Furthermore, it is often difficult to know a priori whether a user model is good enough to be trustable.Recent years have seen a growing interest in another solution to the offline evaluation problem. Using statistical techniques like importance sampling and doubly robust estimation, the approach can give unbiased estimates of metrics for a wide range of problems. It enjoys other benefits as well. For example, it often allows data scientists to obtain a confidence interval for the estimate to quantify the amount of uncertainty; it does not require building user models, so is more robust and easier to apply. All these benefits make the approach particularly attractive to a wide range of problems. Successful applications have been reported in the last few years by some of the industrial leaders.This tutorial gives a review of the basic theory and representative techniques. Applications of these techniques are illustrated through several case studies done at Microsoft and Yahoo!.},

abstract = {The learning managements systems (LMS)s that are widely used to provide access to educational opportunities on the Web are limited by a text based, linear presentation of course materials and the standard temporal restrictions in the traditional classroom. Making a fundamental change in how course materials are presented and interfaced with can make educational opportunities available to a broader spectrum of people with diverse abilities and various circumstances. We have developed a graph-based approach to presenting the learning materials of a course using a system called ENABLE [6, 7] with three major goals: (1) facilitate restructuring a set of synchronous classroom materials into a dynamic online system, (2) provide algorithms to analyze and enhance student performance as well as provide insights to the instructor concerning the efficacy of the learning items and their organization, and (3) identify ways to use data from an existing linear, temporal based course presentation to train predictive models for a course that allows individual flexibility in the ordering of the material. This work demonstrates the possibility of presenting course materials in a graphical way that expresses important relations and provides support for manipulating the order and timing of those materials. The graphical course map adds a new approach to making education accessible to people from many different spectrums of ability that respond and interface better with visual representations and those who will benefit from the removal of temporal limitations.},

We offer an approach that, in addition to providing visualisations of their learning, allows learners to propose changes to their learner model. This aims to help improve the accuracy of the learner model by taking into account student viewpoints on their learning, while also promoting learner reflection on their learning as part of a discussion of the content of their learner model. This aligns well with recent calls for learning analytics for learners. Building on previous research showing that learners will use open learner models, we here investigate their initial reactions to open learner model features to identify the likelihood of uptake in contexts where an open learner model is offered on an optional basis. We focus on university students' perceptions of a range of visualisations and their stated preferences for a facility to view evidence for the learner model data and to propose changes to the values.},

abstract = {Various e-learning systems that provide electronic textbooks are gathering data on large numbers of student reading interactions. This data can potentially be used to model student knowledge acquisition. However, reading activity is often overlooked in canonical student modeling. Prior studies modeling learning from reading either estimate student knowledge at the end of all reading activities, or use quiz performance data with expert-crafted knowledge components (KCs). In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamic modeling of student knowledge is feasible and that automatic text analysis can be applied to save expert effort. We propose a data-driven approach for dynamic student modeling in textbook-based learning. We formulate the problem of modeling learning from reading as a reading-time prediction problem, reconstruct existing popular student models (such as Knowledge Tracing) and explore two automatic text analysis approaches (bag-of-words-based and latent semantic-based) to build the KC model. We evaluate the proposed framework using a dataset collected from a Human-Computer Interaction course. Results show that our approach for reading modeling is plausible; the proposed Knowledge Tracing-based student model reliably outperforms baselines and the latent semantic-based approach can be a promising way to construct a KC model. Serving as the first step to model dynamic knowledge in textbook-based learning, our framework can be applied to a broader context of open-corpus personalized learning.},

An important element in SRL that can bring a better understanding of these tools and their effects concerns to learning motivation theories. In this work I connect these aspects and propose to study the effects of OLM and motivational factors drawn from learning motivation theories. To account for a broader spectrum of OLM representations, I proposed to explore the addition of social information and different levels of granularity in the OLM. I propose to evaluate different designs and then to evaluate the resulting interface in field studies. With the proposed work I expect to gain a deeper understanding of the effects of OLM tools which can be used to guide the development of better tools, better personalization and adaptive mechanisms, better use of such tools in supporting Self-Regulated Learning, and ultimately impact positively in learning.},

abstract = {Digital games can be potent problem solving environments which afford discovery learning through thoughtful exploration [1, 2]. As such, game microworlds facilitate self-regulated learning through sandbox elements in which students have agency in individualizing their pathways of interaction [3]. These agency-driven environments can support learning via individual discovery of problem space constraints and solutions, particularly through boundary testing and productive failure [cf. 4]. Thus, modeling of user interaction in digital learning games can provide considerable insight into emergent trajectories of discovery-based progression, in which equally engaged players may interact differently with the system. To this end, this research leverages educational data mining (EDM) [5] to investigate organic player trajectories of thoughtful exploration (around boundary testing and productive failure) in a learning gamespace. We align behavioral coding with log file data to automatically detect sequences of thoughtful exploration (TE) in play. Results include a robust predictive model of event-stream TE, with multiple trajectories of emergent student behavior-offering insight into organic learning pathways through the game-based problem space, and informing iterative design in optimization of user experience and student engagement.},

abstract = {Traditional Knowledge Tracing, which traces students' knowledge of each decomposed individual skill, has been a popular learner model for adaptive tutoring. Typically, a student is guided to the next skill when the student's knowledge on current skill is inferred as mastery. Unfortunately, this traditional approach no longer suffices to model complex skill practices where simple decompositions can not capture potential additional skills underlying the context as a whole. In such cases, mastery should only be granted when a student not only understands the basic of a skill but also can fluently apply a skill in varied application contexts. In this thesis, we aim to propose a data-driven approach to construct learner models considering different skill application contexts for tracing deeper knowledge, primarily based on Bayesian Networks. We aim to conduct novel, comprehensive, ``deep" evaluations, including internal data-drive evaluations, and external end-user evaluations examining the real world impact for students' personalized learning.},

abstract = {In exploratory search tasks, users usually start with considerable uncertainty about their search goals, and so the search intent of the user may be volatile as the user is constantly learning and reformulating her search hypothesis during the search. This may lead to a noticeable concept drift in the relevance feedback given by the user. We formulate a Bayesian regression model for predicting the accuracy of each individual user feedback and thus find outliers in the feedback data set. To accompany this model, we introduce a timeline interface that visualizes the feedback history to the user and gives her suggestions on which past feedback is likely in need of adjustment. This interface also allows the user to adjust the feedback accuracy inferences made by the model. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the performance of the new user model outperforms a simpler baseline and that the performance approaches that of an oracle, given a small amount of additional user interaction. A user study shows that the proposed modeling technique, combined with the timeline interface, made it easier for the users to notice and correct mistakes in their feedback, resulted in better and more diverse recommendations, allowed users to easier find items they liked, and was more understandable.},

Web advertising includes listing advertisement, which shows advertisements related to a search keyword, and interest-matching advertising, which shows advertisements relevant to a user's search content and browsing history. However, it is difficult to show effective Web advertising to potential purchasers using the technique based on conventional keyword matching. In this paper, we consider a recommender system for Web advertising based on analysis of the user's potential interests. In particular, we focus on a user model with potential interest for a certain website by analyzing browsing history. We introduce a Web advertising recommender system that is based not only based on keyword matching, but also on reported learning results. In addition, we argue the influence of the period for acquisition of the browsing history, which is taken when the users' model is learned.},

In this research study, we explored users' perceptions regarding the uptake and effective use of an open learner model visualisation prototype tool -- Doubtfire++, in facilitating student self-regulated learning supporting Task-oriented Portfolio teaching and learning. We investigated students' perceptions of setting appropriate goals, monitoring performance and reflecting on learning through the use of the visualisation tool to support students in becoming self-regulated learners. Data was collected from 134 users using an online survey questionnaire. Results show that Doubtfire++ positively impacted users' perceptions of setting appropriate goals, monitoring performance and reflecting on learning. User role, experience using Doubtfire++, frequency of using Doubtfire++ and different teaching units significantly impacted respondents' perceptions whereas gender and familiarity with information visualisation techniques had no impact on respondents' perceptions. The results indicate that the approach can facilitate student self-regulated learning, especially for those new to Task-oriented Portfolio teaching and learning of programming units.},

Prior knowledge can improve machine learning models by indicating relevant variables and parameter values. Yet, this prior knowledge is often tacit and only available from domain experts. We present a novel approach that uses interactive visualization to elicit the tacit prior knowledge and uses it to improve the accuracy of prediction models. The main component of our approach is a user model that models the domain expert's knowledge of the relevance of different features for a prediction task. In particular, based on the expert's earlier input, the user model guides the selection of the features on which to elicit user's knowledge next. The results of a controlled user study show that the user model significantly improves prior knowledge elicitation and prediction accuracy, when predicting the relative citation counts of scientific documents in a specific domain.},

OSSM is a recent extension of Open Student Modeling (OSM), a popular technology in the area of personalized learning systems. While in traditional personalized systems, student models were hidden "under the hood" and used to personalize the educational process; open student modeling introduced the ability to view and modify the state of students' own knowledge to support reflection, self-organized learning, and system transparency. Open Social Student Modeling takes this idea one step further by allowing students to explore each other's models or an aggregated model of the class. The idea to make OSM social was originally suggested and explored by Bull [1; 2]. Over the last few years, our team explored several approaches to present OSSM in a highly visual form and evaluated these approaches in a sequence of classroom and lab studies. I will present a summary of this work introducing such systems as QuizMap [3], Progressor [4], and Mastery Grids [5] and reviewing most interesting research evidence collected by the studies.},

abstract = {The accuracy of learner model is the heart of any Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). More intelligence in the ITS needs a more accurate learner model. In the earlier versions of ITS, the student must submit a test before using the ITS. That test was used to build the student model, which contains information about the knowledge of the student, his/her misconceptions, preferences and other related issues. However, this method doesn't work efficiently for school students, because one test canfit accurately evaluate their knowledge and misconceptions. In this research, we implement a system (web application) to get the student model for school students by allowing the students, parents, and instructors to add their assessment and feedback to the model. Then the system uses these multi-entries together with the traditional test to build an enhanced student model (smart learner model). Furthermore, in order to support collaborative learning, the implemented system gives the student the access to open his/her model for other instructors and peers. The proposed system has been applied on a group of students, their parents and instructors. According to the obtained results and the surveys, the studentfis knowledge has been improved in many students. also the students, parents, instructors found the system to be useful, interesting and easy to use. Furthermore, all parties were happy to be engaged in the educational process.},

The numerous existing systems generally integrate three models: learner, domain and adaptation. But, how are these models built and what are the challenges for designers and developers? To answer this question, a study of 50 adaptive educational hypermedia systems was conducted, by comparing each of the three models. This paper presents the results of these comparisons and discusses them. Limits are also highlighted and some avenues of solution are proposed.

abstract = {The gold standard for identifying more effective pedagogical approaches is to perform an experiment. Unfortunately, frequently a hypothesized alternate way of teaching does not yield an improved effect. Given the expense and logistics of each experiment, and the enormous space of potential ways to improve teaching, it would be highly preferable if it were possible to estimate in advance of running a study whether an alternative teaching strategy would improve learning. This is true even in learning at scale situations, since even if it is logistically easier to recruit a large number of subjects, it remains a high stakes environment because the experiment is impacting many real students. For certain classes of alternate teaching approaches, such as new ways to sequence existing material, it is possible to build student models that can be used as simulators to estimate the performance of learners under new proposed teaching methods. However, existing methods for doing so can overestimate the performance of new teaching methods. We instead propose the Robust Evaluation Matrix (REM) method which explicitly considers model mismatch between the student model used to derive the teaching strategy and that used as a simulator to evaluate the teaching strategy effectiveness. We then present two case studies from a fractions intelligent tutoring system and from a concept learning task from prior work that show how REM could be used both to detect when a new instructional policy may not be effective on actual students and to detect when it may be effective in improving student learning.},

abstract = {The digital economy is based on data sharing yet citizens have little control about how their personal data is being used. While data management during web and app-based use is already a challenge, as the Internet of Things (IoT) scales up, the number of devices accessing and requiring personal data will go beyond what a person can manually assess in terms of data access requests. Therefore, new approaches are needed for managing privacy preferences at scale and providing active consent around data sharing that can improve fidelity of operation in alignment with user intent. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel agent-based approach to negotiate the permission to exchange private data between users and services. Our agent negotiates based on learned preferences from actual users. To evaluate our agent-based approach, we developed an experimental tool to run on people's own smartphones, where users were asked to share their private, real data (e.g. photos, contacts, etc) under various conditions. The agent autonomously negotiates potential agreements for the user, which they can refine by manually continuing the negotiation. The agent learns from these interactions and updates the user model in subsequent interactions. We find that the agent is able to effectively capture the preferences and negotiate on the user's behalf but, surprisingly, does not reduce user engagement with the system. Understanding how interaction interplays with agent-based automation is a key component to successful deployment of negotiating agents in real-life settings and within the IoT context in particular.},

These dancing features can be presented back to the students as feedback, in the form of i) summaries, ii) visualisations or iii) narratives.

abstract = {Open Learner Models (OLM) show the learner model to users to assist their self-regulated learning by, for example, helping prompt reflection, facilitating planning and supporting navigation. OLMs can show different levels of detail of the underlying learner model, and can also structure the information differently. As a result, a trade-off may exist between the potential for better support for learning and the complexity of the information shown. This paper investigates students' perceptions about whether offering more and richer information in an OLM will result in more effective support for their self-regulated learning. In a first study, questionnaire responses relating to designs for six visualisations of varying complexity led to the implementation of three variations on one of the designs. A second controlled study involved students interacting with these variations. The study revealed that the most useful variation for searching for suitable learning material was a visualisation combining a basic coloured grid, an extended bar chart-like visualisation indicating related concepts, and a learning gauge.},

abstract = {To serve large user populations, autonomous intervention systems (i.e. intelligent agents) are being developed to play more active roles such as fitness coaches and clinical disease prevention aids. Although generic user models have been developed, users may require extensive individualization to meet their personal needs. Machine learning techniques may be applied to learn tailored intervention policies for users. However, traditional machine learning requires significant amounts of data to learn an optimal policy. For wearable technology, this may mean probing the user to perform some activity and gauging user response. This paper presents a feasible intervention system model and discusses learners for tailoring user intervention policies. We examine how similar the general user model has to be with respect to the tailored model in order for our learner to perform well.},

These methods often require intermittent attention requests with manual data input. This may cause unnecessary burden to the user, leading to annoyance, frustration and possible application abandonment. We designed a novel method that uses on-screen alert dialogs to transform recurrent smartphone usage sessions into moments of data contributions and evaluate how accurately machine learning can reduce unintended interruptions. We collected sensor data from 48 participants during a 4-week long deployment and analysed how personal device usage can be considered in scheduling data inputs. We show that up to 81.7\% of user interactions with the alert dialogs can be accurately predicted using user clusters, and up to 75.5\% of unintended interruptions can be prevented and rescheduled. Our approach can be leveraged by applications that require self-reports on a frequent basis and may provide a better longitudinal QS experience.},

abstract = {Learning mathematics is closely related with the fact that the student knows how to solve problems. There are cognitive theories that say that problem solving teaching requires techniques based on the student's cognitive ability, linked to the type of problems or examples (when cognitive ability is low) that must work. This process requires automated tools to identify the characteristics of the students in order to provide more personalized teaching strategies and also manage feedback that helps the student and the teacher to identify their achievements. These types of automated tools are known as cognitive tutors, which are intelligent tutoring systems, with the particularity of being focused on providing individualized support to students to improve their complex cognitive skills, through problem-solving practice. On the other hand, it is considered that algebra, in addition to arithmetic, are the areas that serve as the basis for the understanding of many mathematical subjects. Therefore, in this thesis project a semi-automated tool is proposed, by means of which, the different modules of a cognitive tutor are implemented, following an instructional design for solving algebra problems, through the management of gamification and game strategies based on the techniques of computational theory of tangible user interfaces. For the student model module, a fuzzy model is used to detect and classify the student's cognitive ability. In modules of model of the domain and the tutor model, fuzzy cognitive maps are defined and implemented to determine, respectively, the activities related to the different types of problems related to various algebra topics and to determine the pedagogical activities that the student must follow in each of the stages of problem solving.},

abstract = {One of the biggest challenges of Adaptive e-learning systems is learner modelling. The learner model should represent the learner's characteristics as faithfully as possible in order to provide adaptive learning. Among these characteristics, the learner's knowledge is considered to be the core characteristic of the learner model, as adaptive e-learning systems are centered on the learner's knowledge, since acquiring « knowledge » about a specific domain or concept is considered the main goal of learning and instruction. In this paper, we propose a novel adult learner's knowledge model using ontologies and rule reasoning, by trying to define the different components that construct the learner's knowledge in an exhaustive yet a simple way. The proposed model takes into account different elements of the learner's knowledge, such as the different knowledge types and categories, the learner's prior knowledge accumulated through his/her experiences, his/her misconceptions, errors and the previously learned but forgotten knowledge.},

Identifying a resource of relevant information to a specific context becomes a real challenge. In the course of our work we are interested in recommendation of pedagogical resources within a learning ecosystem. We have chosen to model a learning ecosystem as a system of information systems (SoIS). In this SoIS we introduce a resource recommender system. This system is based on users' votes (learners, teachers), and the similarity between the description of pedagogical resources and the learners' profile. In our approach, we take into account the willingness to collaborate. Therefore, we exploit a collaboration model that supports learning ecosystem to answer the demand for questions such as, who collaborates with whom, how, when, why, on what and where, etc. The work presented in this paper is focused on at recommendation of pedagogical resources within a learning ecosystem.},

abstract = {The paper presents semantic clustering and artificial neural network (ANN) based learning analytics software agent for personalised adaptive multi-agent learning system. First of all, systematic literature review on application of ANN to personalise learning in Web of Science database was performed. After that, methodology of application of ANN and semantic clustering of learning material in personalised adaptive multi-agent learning system is presented. In the paper, personalisation in multi-agent learning system is based on learning styles model that requires the use of psychological questionnaire to determine student's learning styles. The results of filling in the questionnaire could be incorrect since some students may answer the questionnaire dishonestly, irresponsibly, or make mistakes in self-diagnosis. This results in creation of an incorrect student's model. This causes the system to provide suboptimal learning objects and scenarios to the student. The authors present a model of ANN based learning analytics agent to be used in the system. Proposed agent uses ANN to associate students' learning styles with their real behaviour within the learning environment. The key factor describing the behaviour of students within the system is the learning content they seek out independently. Clustering the visited documents based on semantic content categorizes students into groups. Belonging to a semantic cluster is one of the inputs that can be used to train ANN agent. After training, the agent could identify potentially faulty student models by looking for anomalous behaviour for those learning styles. Such problems can be resolved by providing alternative learning objects or scenarios to the students and observing their choices.1},

abstract = {This paper describes the Pedagogical Model of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) for learning Computational Logic: SIAL. This ITS teaches classical refutation by resolution concepts. SIAL is a Model-Based System as its Domain Model is an Automated Theorem Prover (ATP) for First Order Logic (FOL). This allows SIAL to perform an accurate error diagnosis process while, at the same time, accepting several equivalent valid solutions to the same problem. This feature adds a general open-ended solution capability to SIAL which facilitates the adaptation to the students' way of thinking and allows them to explore and take their own decisions (and make their own mistakes). The Pedagogical Model of SIAL takes advantage of the error diagnosis capabilities of the Domain Model to offer a learner-adaptive tutorial action, according to the user cognitive profile. An example of the knowledge involved in the assessment of the next tutorial action based on the student model, and how SIAL adapts its behaviour to the student's assessed cognitive capabilities, is included. Some data obtained after a period of use of SIAL is also presented.},

abstract = {Machine learning? is a powerful tool in modeling historic user data and converting it into a computational user model. However, it is nearly impossible for a machine learning process to have access to all data pertaining to a user. This leads to potential gaps in the user model produced. Thus, involving the user in overseeing and controlling the modelling process may be considered as a worthwhile goal. This form of user model control is often referred to as scrutability in the personalization research domain. The approach proposed in this research is to combine the benefits of machine learning driven user modelling and scrutable user control in the modelling process. This PhD is at its midpoint and is currently focused on building the model while taking into consideration how user feedback may be incorporated. This feedback is solicited iteratively, enabling the ML process to retrain with the benefit of the user input. The early results of the experimental work show promising prediction accuracy results.},

With all the potential benefits of these tools " productivity increase and improved group communication " come significant challenges. Specifically, users find it hard to focus their attention on content that is relevant to them due to the load of conversational content. This load can be handled by personalized content presentation and summarization mitigated by user profiling. We present an unsupervised approach for implicitly modeling group chat users through a combination of a probabilistic topic model and social analysis. We evaluate our approach by testing it on a task of conversation participation prediction, serving as a proxy for anticipating user interests, and show that by utilizing our approach, a system successfully predicts users participation in conversations. We further analyze the contribution of the various user model components and show them to be significant.},
