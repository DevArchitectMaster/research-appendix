abstract = {Learner models are a key element of many intelligent computer-based assessment and training approaches. Oftentimes, these models, the processes, and evidences are hidden from the learners and even teachers. Open learner models (OLM) are intended to make the underlying logic of a model as well as the evidences that contributed to a certain student appraisal transparent to its users. Furthermore, they are intended to support learning in a formative sense, aiming to help learners to self-monitor, plan, focus, and work independently as well as to communicate and negotiate appraisals with peers and teachers. We present a use case where Lea's OLM uses evidence from a speed-reading training application, to build the model. Learners use a persuasion function to interact with the system and maintain the OLM. The study showed that students are able to use it efficiently in order to make their model more accurate. We argue that persuasion, and other interactive maintenance features, are a strong approach to improve a transparent and accurate learner modelling, specifically when the underlying evidences are manifold and from multiple, partially unclear sources. Moreover, we found that the possibility to interact with the system on an individual basis and to have the possibility to intervene in the process is a strong means of making educational systems more personalized},

abstract = {Guiding students to the learning activities that are most appropriate for their current level of knowledge is one of the goals that adaptive educational systems tried to achieve during the last decades. Recently, several attempts have been made to use Open Learner Models (OLM) as a tool for achieving this goal. While the original goal of OLM is to help students reflect about their own learning process, extending OLM with navigation support functionality enables students to take immediate actions towards improving their knowledge. In this work, we attempted to extend the navigation support functionality of OLM by developing a fine-grained OLM that offers student knowledge visualization on both topic and concept levels. The fine-grained OLM enables students to directly explore connections between their knowledge and available learning activities, making an informed decision about their next learning steps. To assess the impact of the new type of OLM, we evaluated several versions of it in a classroom study, while also comparing it with data from our earlier studies that featured a coarse-grained OLM. Our results suggest that the fine-grained OLM considerably impacts student choice of learning activities, making student learning more efficient. We also found that the specific design features of fine-grained OLM could affect students' confidence and persistence while selecting and attempting the learning activities.},

Creating student models that leverage gaze information holds significant promise for game-based learning environments. This paper introduces a gaze-enhanced student modeling framework that incorporates student eye tracking to dynamically predict students' performance in a game-based learning environment for microbiology education, CRYSTAL ISLAND. The gaze-enhanced student modeling framework was investigated in a study comparing a gaze-enhanced student model with a baseline student model that does not utilize student eye-tracking. Results of a study conducted with 65 college students interacting with the CRYSTAL ISLAND game-based learning environment indicate that the gaze-enhanced student model significantly outperforms the baseline model in dynamically predicting student problem-solving performance. The findings suggest that incorporating gaze into student modeling can contribute to a new generation of student models for game-based learning environments.},

abstract = {We propose a novel way to train ranking models, such as recommender systems, that are both effective and efficient. Knowledge distillation (KD) was shown to be successful in image recognition to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency. We propose a KD technique for learning to rank problems, called ranking distillation (RD). Specifically, we train a smaller student model to learn to rank documents/items from both the training data and the supervision of a larger teacher model. The student model achieves a similar ranking performance to that of the large teacher model, but its smaller model size makes the online inference more efficient. RD is flexible because it is orthogonal to the choices of ranking models for the teacher and student. We address the challenges of RD for ranking problems. The experiments on public data sets and state-of-the-art recommendation models showed that RD achieves its design purposes: the student model learnt with RD has less than an half size of the teacher model while achieving a ranking performance similar tothe teacher model and much better than the student model learnt without RD.},

The teacher model generates the output distribution called soft label to make a label for the unlabeled data stream and the student model trained by the unlabeled data stream with the soft label from teacher model. Experimental results show that the proposed method has better performances such as classification accuracy than that of the batch learning model trained by labeled data stream only.},

abstract = {With the development of sophisticated learning environments and learner-centric didactic approaches, personalized learning is in high demand. Personalization in learning environments occurs when such systems fit the learner profiles, which help in increasing their performance and quality of learning. Personalized learning refers to the pedagogy where the pace of learning, the instructional preferences and the learning objects are optimized as per the needs of each learner. To support customization, recommender systems can be used to recommend appropriate learning objects (LOs) corresponding to the learner attributes. This paper proposes an architecture of an Adaptive Personalized Learning Environment (APLE) and its features. APLE assists the learners by content recommendation and adapts to the learning preferences and performance of the learner. It has three modules such as Learner modelling Unit (LModU), Content Managing Unit (CMU) and Learner Monitoring Unit (LMU). LModU creates a Learner Model (LM) from the learner attributes.The system proposes to represent learner attributes as an ontology and learner modelling using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. The LMU should perform the knowledge assessment of the learner and monitor their changing preferences. CMU got two components, LO Manager and Content Recommendation Engine (CRE). LO Manager is responsible for creating the metadata corresponding to the learning resource following the IEEE LOM specification. CRE is an expert system which will map the learner attribute with the LOs. Currently, the CRE is implemented as a rule-based prediction engine where the rules represent the association between each LOM field with the learner attributes. This on-going research work aims at answering questions regarding the feasibility and effectiveness of mapping LO attributes and learner attributes.},

abstract = {Multi-label image classification is a fundamental but challenging task towards general visual understanding. Existing methods found the region-level cues (e.g., features from RoIs) can facilitate multi-label classification. Nevertheless, such methods usually require laborious object-level annotations (i.e., object labels and bounding boxes) for effective learning of the object-level visual features. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient deep framework to boost multi-label classification by distilling knowledge from weakly-supervised detection task without bounding box annotations. Specifically, given the image-level annotations, (1) we first develop a weakly-supervised detection (WSD) model, and then (2) construct an end-to-end multi-label image classification framework augmented by a knowledge distillation module that guides the classification model by the WSD model according to the class-level predictions for the whole image and the object-level visual features for object RoIs. The WSD model is the teacher model and the classification model is the student model. After this cross-task knowledge distillation, the performance of the classification model is significantly improved and the efficiency is maintained since the WSD model can be safely discarded in the test phase. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets (MS-COCO and NUS-WIDE) show that our framework achieves superior performances over the state-of-the-art methods on both performance and efficiency.},

We applied seven different supervised learning classification algorithms, using personality scores for each dimension (high or low) as target values, and analyzed the results. The findings were encouraging and revealed that most of Big Five personality dimensions can in fact be predicted using mainly educational data features, which could have an added value on unobtrusive dynamic learner modelling.},

abstract = {Integrating external knowledge into the recommendation system has attracted increasing attention in both industry and academic communities. Recent methods mostly take the power of neural network for effective knowledge representation to improve the recommendation performance. However, the heavy deep architectures in existing models are usually incorporated in an embedded manner, which may greatly increase the model complexity and lower the runtime efficiency.To simultaneously take the power of deep learning for external knowledge modeling as well as maintaining the model efficiency at test time, we reformulate the problem of recommendation with external knowledge into a generalized distillation framework. The general idea is to free the complex deep architecture into a separate model, which is only used in the training phrase, while abandoned at test time. In particular, in the training phrase, the external knowledge is processed by a comprehensive teacher model to produce valuable information to teach a simple and efficient student model. Once the framework is learned, the teacher model is abandoned, and only the succinct yet enhanced student model is used to make fast predictions at test time. In this article, we specify the external knowledge as user review, and to leverage it in an effective manner, we further extend the traditional generalized distillation framework by designing a Selective Distillation Network (SDNet) with adversarial adaption and orthogonality constraint strategies to make it more robust to noise information.Extensive experiments verify that our model can not only improve the performance of rating prediction, but also can significantly reduce time consumption when making predictions as compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {A Digital twin is the virtual replica of a physical system. Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and prognostics of machines and products. Traditionally, building a digital twin requires many built-in sensors to monitor various physical phenomena associated with cyber-physical systems such as vibration, energy consumption, etc. However, many legacy manufacturing systems do not have multi-physics sensors built-in by default. Moreover, it might not be feasible to intrusively place sensors in these systems after they are manufactured. To bring the advantages of digitalization to legacy manufacturing systems, this paper contributes with an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based methodology to build digital twins using an indirect medium such as side-channels, which can localize anomalous faults and infer the quality of the products being manufactured while keeping itself up-to-date. We achieve this by exploring and utilizing the side-channels (emissions such as acoustics, power, magnetic, etc.) of the system that unintentionally reveal the cyber and physical state of the system. To validate our methodology, in this paper, we focus on building a digital twin model of a Fused-Deposition Modeling (FDM) based Cartesian additive manufacturing system. The proposed methodology achieves 83.09\% accuracy in anomaly localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the possibility of modeling and maintaining a living digital twin of a manufacturing system by extracting information from the side-channels using low-end IoT sensors.},

abstract = {As services based on Machine Learning (ML) applications find increasing use, there is a growing risk of attack against such systems. Recently, adversarial machine learning has received a lot of attention, where an adversary is able to craft an input or manipulate an input to cause an ML system to misclassify. Another attack of concern is when an adversary with access to a ML model can reverse engineer attributes of a target class, creating a privacy concern, which is the subject of this paper. Such attacks use non-sensitive data obtainable by the adversary and the confidence levels returned by the ML model to infer sensitive attributes of the target user. Model Inversion attacks may be classified as white-box, where the ML model is known to the attacker, or black-box, where the adversary does not know the internals of the model. If the attacker has access to non-sensitive data of a target user, they can infer sensitive data by applying gradient ascent on the confidence returned by the model. Therefore, a black-box attack can be mounted by numerical approximations of the gradient to perform the gradient ascent. In this work, we present MLPrivacyGuard, a countermeasure against black-box model inversion attack is presented. This countermeasure consists of adding controlled noise to the output of the confidence function. It is important to preserve the accuracy of prediction/classification for the real users of the model while preventing attackers to infer sensitive data. This involves a trade-off between misclassification error and the effectiveness of defense. Based on experimental results, we demonstrate that when noise is injected with a long-tailed distribution, the objectives of low misclassification error with a strong defense can be attained as model inversion attacks are neutralized because numerical approximation of gradient ascent is unable to converge.},

abstract = {Attention plays an important role in the daily lives of people and especially in learning. It may be influenced by different factors since childhood or during the aging process because of deficits such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which is responsible of learning difficulties. Serious games for attention training may be helpful to develop self-regulation skills in attention training through a personalized game experience. It can provide children with appropriate guidance to develop their self-regulation skills while enhancing their cognitive functions such as attention. The transparency of the user model may help users (both children and tutors) to follow their progression, and to develop their learning strategy. In this paper, a pilot study was conducted to evaluate the assessment step of a developed attention training serious game. The objective was to study whether the transparency of the learner model influences the users' perception of their attention and self-regulate their learning. The primary results of the pilot experiment show that open learner model influences the decision of users on difficulty level preference that may be promising in self-regulated attention training.},

Their complexity makes them chal-lenging to use though, especially for less experienced developers. In this paper, we outline our approach for an user-adaptive IDE that is able to track the interactions, recognize the user's intent and expertise, and provide relevant, personalized recommendations in real-time. To obtain a user model and provide recommendations, interaction data is processed in a two-stage process: first, we derive a bandit based global model of general task patterns from a dataset of labeled interactions. Second, when the user is working with the IDE, we apply a pre-trained classifier in real-time to get task labels from the user's interactions. With those and user feedback we fine-tune a local copy of the global model. As a result, we obtain a personalized user model which provides user-specific recommendations. We finally present various approaches for using these recommendations to adapt the IDE's interface. Modifications range from visual highlighting to task automation, including explanatory feedback.},

abstract = {Online academic reading assessments can test graduate students' reading ability, while the results of tests as a feedback can help students reflect on their own ability, realize their weaknesses, and then take actions to improve their ability. These behaviors form the basis of self-regulated learning ability. In this paper, a negotiated online reading assessment system is developed to provide students with the function of self-assessment and reflection. For designing the system, the authors use the concept of a negotiated learner model, so that students may negotiate with the system and try to reach an agreement. In order to explore the differences in students' learning behaviors in such a system, the authors used the hidden Markov Model to construct the behavioral model of students' self-regulated learning ability. Furthermore, the authors differentiated the negotiation behaviors of students with high and low self-regulated learning ability in the reading assessment system. The results showed that the students in the high and low self-regulated learning ability groups shared the behaviors of peer comparison and retesting. The high self-regulated learning group tended to transit among retesting, peer comparison, test reflection, and self-assessment. The students in the low self-regulated learning group tended to transit among retesting, peer comparison, viewing grades, and self-reflection. The results indicated that the students tended to re-test to negotiate with the system, and that the students in the high self-regulated learning group may reflect on learning through negotiation and further plan their learning strategies.},

It is worth noting that the learning system recommendation is different from the general recommendation. Not only the method, the evaluation standard of recommendation result is also different. We should not simply recommend to students the exercises they must or must not mastered, but recommend to them the learning resources they should have within the range of their abilities according to the theory of proximal development zone. We also use the bayesian knowledge tracing model to judge students' mastery of knowledge as the evaluation standard of this algorithm.},

While it is generally easier for assessors to conduct preference judgements than absolute judgements, it is often not practical to obtain preference judgements for all combinations of documents. However, this problem can be overcome if we can effectively utilise noisy and incomplete preference judgements such as those that can be obtained from crowdsourcing. Our measure, η, is based on a simple probabilistic user model of the labellers which assumes that each document is associated with a graded relevance score for a given query. We also consider situations where multiple preference probabilities, rather than preference labels, are given for each document pair. For example, in the absence of manual preference judgements, one might want to employ an ensemble of machine learning techniques to obtain such estimated probabilities. For this scenario, we propose another ranking evaluation measure called η_p $. Through simulated experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed measures η and η_p$ can evaluate rankings more reliably than τmbox- b$, a popular rank correlation measure.},

abstract = {Recently, deep learning-based saliency prediction methods have achieved significant accuracy improvements. However, they are hard to embed in practical multimedia applications due to large memory consumption and running time caused by complicated architectures. In addition, most methods are fine-tuned from pre-trained models for classification tasks, and networks cannot flexibly be transferred for a new task. In this paper, a condensed and randomly initialized student network is employed to achieve higher efficiency by transferring knowledge from complicated and well-trained teacher networks. This is the first use of knowledge distillation for efficient pixel-wise saliency prediction. Instead of directly minimizing Euclidean distance between feature maps, we propose two statistical representations of feature maps (i.e., first-order and second-order statistics) as knowledge. We conduct experiments on three kinds of teacher networks and four benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the teacher networks, the student networks achieve an acceleration ratio of 4.56-4.73. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed model achieves competitive accuracy with faster running speed (up to 4.38 times) and smaller model size (up to 93.27\% reduction). We further embedded the proposed saliency prediction model into a video captioning application. The saliency-embedded approaches improve video captioning on all test metrics with a small complexity cost. The student-model embedded approach achieves 25\% time saving with similar performance to the teacher embedded one.},

abstract = {In automatic speech recognition, performance gains can often be obtained by combining an ensemble of multiple models. However, this can be computationally expensive when performing recognition. Teacher–student learning alleviates this cost by training a single student model to emulate the combined ensemble behaviour. Only this student needs to be used for recognition. Previously investigated teacher–student criteria often limit the forms of diversity allowed in the ensemble, and only propagate information from the teachers to the student at the frame level. This paper addresses both of these issues by examining teacher–student learning within a sequence-level framework, and assessing the flexibility that these approaches offer. Various sequence-level teacher–student criteria are examined in this work, to propagate sequence posterior information. A training criterion based on the Kullback–Leibler KL-divergence between context-dependent state sequence posteriors is proposed that allows for a diversity of state cluster sets to be present in the ensemble. This criterion is shown to be an upper bound to a more general KL-divergence between word sequence posteriors, which places even fewer restrictions on the ensemble diversity, but whose gradient can be expensive to compute. These methods are evaluated on the augmented multi-party interaction AMI meeting transcription and MGB-3 television broadcast audio tasks.},

abstract = {Continuous and effective monitoring of chronic diseases and their associated treatments might have a decisive impact on reducing risks and improving life quality of patients. This, however, demands new and innovative methods for engineering systems that support the required capabilities. Research on the application of the novel concept of Digital Twin (DT) in healthcare might provide the means to revolutionize traditional medical practices. A DT comprises a set of virtual representations of both the structural elements and dynamics of any physical asset (e.g., a patient) throughout its lifecycle. In the healthcare domain, it might represent a significan step forward towards tightening and improving the interactions between systems, caregivers and patients. Moreover, integrating data-driven methods (e.g., Machine Learning) and DT could serve as a noteworthy mechanism to not only track patients' health continuously, but also to evaluate the application and evolution of medical treatments virtually. In this paper, we describe our vision for the application of DT in precision medicine. Our contributions are twofold. First, we describe our initial ideas for a reference model that leverages DT capabilities and research advances in self-adaptive systems and autonomic computing to engineer smart and fl xible software systems in healthcare. We expect these systems to alleviate complexity and assist in the planning and decision-making processes when applying medical treatments to patients by healthcare professionals. Then, we elaborate on the definitio of internal structures for DT to support precision medicine techniques in the context of continuous monitoring and personalized data-driven medical treatments.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student learning framework for the preprocessing of a speech recognizer, leveraging the online noise tracking capabilities of improved minima controlled recursive averaging IMCRA and deep learning of nonlinear interactions between speech and noise. First, a teacher model with deep architectures is built to learn the target of ideal ratio masks IRMs using simulated training pairs of clean and noisy speech data. Next, a student model is trained to learn an improved speech presence probability by incorporating the estimated IRMs from the teacher model into the IMCRA approach. The student model can be compactly designed in a causal processing mode having no latency with the guidance of a complex and noncausal teacher model. Moreover, the clean speech requirement, which is difficult to meet in real-world adverse environments, can be relaxed for training the student model, implying that noisy speech data can be directly used to adapt the regression-based enhancement model to further improve speech recognition accuracies for noisy speech collected in such conditions. Experiments on the CHiME-4 challenge task show that our best student model with bidirectional gated recurrent units BGRUs can achieve a relative word error rate WER reduction of 18.85\% for the real test set when compared to unprocessed system without acoustic model retraining. However, the traditional teacher model degrades the performance of the unprocessed system in this case. In addition, the student model with a deep neural network DNN in causal mode having no latency yields a relative WER reduction of 7.94\% over the unprocessed system with 670 times less computing cycles when compared to the BGRU-equipped student model. Finally, the conventional speech enhancement and IRM-based deep learning method destroyed the ASR performance when the recognition system became more powerful. While our proposed approach could still improve the ASR performance even in the more powerful recognition system.},

abstract = {Social robots are increasingly applied to support children’s learning, but how a robot can foster (or may hinder) learning is still not fully clear. One technique used by teachers is scaffolding, temporarily assisting learners to achieve new skills or levels of understanding they would not reach on their own. We ask if and how a social robot can be utilized to scaffold second-language learning of children at kindergarten age (4--7 years). Specifically, we explore an adapt-and-explain scaffolding strategy in which a robot acts as a peer-like tutor who dynamically adapts its behavior or the learning tasks to the cognitive and affective state of the child, and provides verbal explanations of these adaptations. An evaluation study with 40 children shows that children benefit from the learning adaptation and that the explanations have a positive effect especially for slower learners. Further, in 76\% of all cases the robot managed to “re-engage” children who started to disengage from the learning interaction, helping them to achieve an overall higher learning gain. These findings demonstrate that a social robot equipped with suitable scaffolding mechanisms can increase engagement and learning, especially when being adaptive to the individual behavior and states of a child learner.},

In order to obtain effective representations, metric learning has become one of the most active researches in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. However, models using trained networks for predictions are often cumbersome and difficult to be deployed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel deep distillation metric learning (DDML) for online teaching in the procedure of learning the distance metric. Specifically, we employ model distillation to transfer the knowledge acquired by the larger model to the smaller model. Unlike the 2-step offline and mutual online manners, we propose to train a powerful teacher model, who transfer the knowledge to a lightweight and generalizable student model and iteratively improved by the feedback from the student model. We show that our method has achieved state-of-the-art results on CUB200-2011 and CARS196 while having advantages in computational efficiency.},

abstract = {In recent years, digital twin (DT) has been an efficient and reliable representation tool for Industry 4.0 in general and fault diagnosis and monitoring, especially in machinery consisting of several components working in tandem that introduce a large amount of data to be processed. Having a cloud-based and platform-independent system that can interpret Big Data in real-time and represent the processed information in a user-friendly manner offers the opportunity not only for improving fault diagnosis and troubleshooting automation, but also offering a better representation of data for operators, technicians and engineers. This not only decreases the repair costs by enabling constant components' state of health awareness, but also increases the efficacy of the apparatus by lowering the downtimes due to faults and issues.In this paper (WindTwin), we propose a real-time, interactive and dynamic 3-D neural-network model that provides important information of a small-scale wind turbine (WT) machinery setup including the state of health of different components (bearings, shafts) based on monitoring sensors (vibrations and temperature) and operations conditions (rotation speed). The system features real-time data processing of six sensors with eight channels including two single axis-accelerometer, one tri-axial accelerometer, one acoustics (microphone), one temperature and one light sensor (for rotational speed) with sampling data collection rate of 51.2 kHz achieved through an edge developed machine learning algorithm based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm using single hidden-layer feed forward neural network (SLFN) and gradient-based backpropagation (BP) training algorithm. The system also provides platform-independent (desktop and mobile companion app) user interfaces thanks to its cloud-based data processing integration. The prototype system proved to have on average 83.33 \% accuracy for the vibration-based condition monitoring model across the three different rotation speed of 15Hz, 9Hz and 12Hz with 1 second latency for different fault conditions to be reflected on the DT counterpart.},

We explore the robustness and generalizability of the model. We explicitly formulate simplifying assumptions that the model makes and we discuss methods for visualizing learning curves based on the model. We also report on an application of the model to data from a learning system for introductory programming; these experiments illustrate possibly misleading interpretation of model results due to differences in item difficulty. Overall, our results show that greater care has to be taken in the application of the model and in the interpretation of results obtained with the model.},

abstract = {Inductive reasoning is an important educational practice but can be difficult for teachers to support in the classroom due to the high level of preparation and classroom time needed to choose the teaching materials that challenge students' current views. Intelligent tutoring systems can potentially facilitate this work for teachers by supporting the automatic adaptation of examples based on a student model of the induction process. However, current models of inductive reasoning usually lack two main characteristics helpful to adaptive learning environments, individual differences of students and tracing of students' learning as they receive feedback. In this paper, we describe a model to predict and simulate inductive reasoning of students for a categorization task. Our approach uses a Bayesian model for describing the reasoning processes of students. This model allows us to predict students' choices in categorization questions by accounting for their feature biases. Using data gathered from 222 students categorizing three topics, we find that our model has a 75\% accuracy, which is 10\% greater than a baseline model. Our model is a contribution to learning analytics by enabling us to assign different bias profiles to individual students and tracking these profile changes over time through which we can gain a better understanding of students' learning processes. This model may be relevant for systematically analysing students' differences and evolution in inductive reasoning strategies while supporting the design of adaptive inductive learning environments.},

We further varied rates of "learning" and personalization with the system to test user preferences and changes in participants' linguistic and psychological interactions with an unadapted versus adapted user model, and to determine whether those changes were attributable to acclimatization with the system or to the modeling capabilities, seeking to address 3 research questions: What are the psycholinguistic characteristics of user interactions with a dialogue system designed to act as a scheduling assistant? How does a system's ability to learn about a user and maintain a user model affect these interactions? Are changes in interaction styles uniquely attributable to user modeling ability rather than simply user familiarity or acclimation with the system? We present a linguistic analysis of the results using summary measures generated by a widely used psycholinguistic text analysis tool. Some of the measures seem to present the slightly paradoxical effect of reduced user engagement when a conversational agent explicitly discloses information about its user model to the user. These results suggest that future studies should take care to consider the degree to which the user model is directly exposed to the user. That is, being overly forthcoming about what has been learned about a user may undermine attempts to tailor conversational agents to actively engage and relate to users.},

abstract = {Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is a widely used method for learning from graph-based data. However, it fails to use the unlabeled data to its full potential, thereby hindering its ability. Given some pseudo labels of the unlabeled data, the GCN can benefit from this extra supervision. Based on Knowledge Distillation and Ensemble Learning, lots of methods use a teacher-student architecture to make better use of the unlabeled data and then make a better prediction. However, these methods introduce unnecessary training costs and a high bias of student model if the teacher's predictions are unreliable. Besides, the final ensemble gains are limited due to limited diversity in the combined models. Therefore, we propose Reliable Data Distillation, a reliable data driven semi-supervised GCN training method. By defining the node reliability and edge reliability in a graph, we can make better use of high quality data and improve the graph representation learning. Furthermore, considering the data reliability and data importance, we propose a new ensemble learning method for GCN and a novel Self-Boosting SSL Framework to combine the above optimizations. Finally, our extensive evaluation of Reliable Data Distillation on real-world datasets shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on semi-supervised node classification tasks.},

abstract = {Lifelong Learning encompasses vast learning opportunities and MOOCs are a learning environment that can be up to the challenge if current modeling challenges are addressed. Studies have shown the importance of modeling the learner for a more personal and tailored learning experience in MOOC. Furthermore, Open Learner Models have proven their added value in facilitating learner's follow-up and course content personalization. However, while modeling the learner's knowledge is a common practice, modeling the learner's psychological state is a relegated concern within the community. This is despite the myriad of scientific evidence backing up the importance and repercussion of the learner's psychological state during and on the learning process.Flow is a psychological state characterized by total immersion in a task and a state of optimal performance. Programmers often refer to it as "being in the zone". It reliably correlates favorable learning metrics, such as motivation and engagement, among others. The aim of this paper is to propose a functional and technical architecture (comprising a Domain Model, a Flow Model, and an Open Learner Model for MOOC in a Lifelong Learning context) accounting for the learner's Flow state. This work is dedicated to MOOC designers/providers, pedagogical engineers, psychology, and education researchers who meet difficulties to incorporate and account for the Flow psychological state in a MOOC.},

However, directly deploying deep models on mobile devices presents both capacity bottleneck and prohibitive privacy risk. To address these problems, we develop a Differentially Private Knowledge Distillation (DPKD) framework to enable on-device deep learning as well as preserve training data privacy. We modify the conventional Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) paradigm by compressing the knowledge acquired by the ensemble of teachers into a student model in a differentially private manner. The student model is then trained on both the labeled, public data and the distilled knowledge by adopting a mixed training algorithm. Extensive experiments on popular image datasets, as well as the real implementation on a mobile device show that DPKD can not only benefit from the distilled knowledge but also provide a strong differential privacy guarantee (ε=2$) with only marginal decreases in accuracy.},

However, it is also a challenging topic for students of all ages and only one teacher in a classroom is too little to support approximately 30 students at the same time. Therefore, intelligent tutoring systems might be a meaningful way to support students and teachers. In this paper we describe an approach to support computer science lessons in secondary schools by using a learner model. We are explaining how the three phases of our learner model (data collection - profile construction - profile application) can be implemented for teaching robotics by using different types of implicit and explicit data to generate feedback for the teacher concerning competencies and knowledge of the students on the one hand and by supporting collaboration and group formation amongst the students on the other hand. The model is derived from literature and supported by data from different studies.},

We consider four hierarchical levels of healthcare data generation and processing of increasing complexity and wider implications. At the imaging scanner and instrument level, AI aims at improving, simplifying, and standardizing data acquisition and preparation. We present examples of systems for AI-driven automatic patient iso-centering before a computed tomography scan, deep learning-based image reconstruction, and creation of optimized and standardized visualizations, for example, automatic rib-unfolding. At the reading and reporting levels, AI focuses on the detection and characterization of abnormalities and on automatic measurements in images. We introduce multiple AI systems for the brain, heart, lung, prostate, and musculoskeletal disease. The third level is exemplified by the integrated nature of the clinical data in a patient-specific manner. The AI algorithms at this level focus on risk prediction and stratification, as opposed to merely detecting, measuring, and quantifying images. An AI-based approach for individualizing radiation dose in lung stereotactic body radiotherapy is discussed. The digital twin is presented as a concept of individualized computational modeling of human physiology. Finally, at the cohort and population analysis levels, the focus of AI shifts from clinical decision-making to operational decisions and process optimization.},

abstract = {Multimodal learning aims at utilizing information from a variety of data modalities to improve the generalization performance. One common approach is to seek the common information that is shared among different modalities for learning, whereas we can also fuse the supplementary information to leverage modality-specific information. Though the supplementary information is often desired, most existing multimodal approaches can only learn from samples with complete modalities, which wastes a considerable amount of data collected. Otherwise, model-based imputation needs to be used to complete the missing values and yet may introduce undesired noise, especially when the sample size is limited. In this paper, we proposed a framework based on knowledge distillation, utilizing the supplementary information from all modalities, and avoiding imputation and noise associated with it. Specifically, we first train models on each modality independently using all the available data. Then the trained models are used as teachers to teach the student model, which is trained with the samples having complete modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in extensive empirical studies on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets.},

abstract = {Molecular property prediction (e.g., energy) is an essential problem in chemistry and biology. Unfortunately, many supervised learning methods usually suffer from the problem of scarce labeled molecules in the chemical space, where such property labels are generally obtained by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation which is extremely computational costly. An effective solution is to incorporate the unlabeled molecules in a semi-supervised fashion. However, learning semi-supervised representation for large amounts of molecules is challenging, including the joint representation issue of both molecular essence and structure, the conflict between representation and property leaning. Here we propose a novel framework called Active Semi-supervised Graph Neural Network (ASGN) by incorporating both labeled and unlabeled molecules. Specifically, ASGN adopts a teacher-student framework. In the teacher model, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning method to learn general representation that jointly exploits information from molecular structure and molecular distribution. Then in the student model, we target at property prediction task to deal with the learning loss conflict. At last, we proposed a novel active learning strategy in terms of molecular diversities to select informative data during the whole framework learning. We conduct extensive experiments on several public datasets. Experimental results show the remarkable performance of our ASGN framework.},

abstract = {Remote Health Monitoring (RHM) has the potential to increase operational safety in extreme environments. Negative stress exposure influences mission success or the short- and long-term health conditions of deployed personnel. To quantify negative stress, we introduce a washable smart textile with integrated sensors. Analyzing the transmitted sensor values, medical advisors monitor up to 72 sensor values in parallel in case of an average group size of eight people. In order to aggregate the amount of data, we propose a stress level scale that includes stress trends. To predict individual stress levels based on sensor data, environmental quantities and the individual physiological fingerprint, we train different machine learning models. To evaluate such models, we implement a data acquisition environment to label data snapshots. Therefore, we do not need to collect in-field data and expose humans to negative stress. Moreover, we can mock sensor failures and rare, but relevant, sensor value combinations that are difficult to acquire in real-world scenarios. Our evaluation environment identifies Random Forest Regressor from a set of 25 models to perform best to predict individual stress levels. This model performs 23.19 times better than a zero rule classifier to distinguish among nine stress levels for mission goal health condition and 10.50 times better for mission goal mission success. Finally, we present our current RHM user interface design. It addresses issues such as information overload, avatar sympathy and unnecessary navigation paths.},

abstract = {With successful applications of deep feature learning algorithms, spoken language identification (LID) on long utterances obtains satisfactory performance. However, the performance on short utterances is drastically degraded even when the LID system is trained using short utterances. The main reason is due to the large variation of the representation on short utterances which results in high model confusion. To narrow the performance gap between long, and short utterances, we proposed a teacher-student representation learning framework based on a knowledge distillation method to improve LID performance on short utterances. In the proposed framework, in addition to training the student model on short utterances with their true labels, the internal representation from the output of a hidden layer of the student model is supervised with the representation corresponding to their longer utterances. By reducing the distance of internal representations between short, and long utterances, the student model can explore robust discriminative representations for short utterances, which is expected to reduce model confusion. We conducted experiments on our in-house LID dataset, and NIST LRE07 dataset, and showed the effectiveness of the proposed methods for short utterance LID tasks.},

abstract = {Recently, deep learning-based models have been widely studied for click-through rate (CTR) prediction and lead to improved prediction accuracy in many industrial applications. However, current research focuses primarily on building complex network architectures to better capture sophisticated feature interactions and dynamic user behaviors. The increased model complexity may slow down online inference and hinder its adoption in real-time applications. Instead, our work targets at a new model training strategy based on knowledge distillation (KD). KD is a teacher-student learning framework to transfer knowledge learned from a teacher model to a student model. The KD strategy not only allows us to simplify the student model as a vanilla DNN model but also achieves significant accuracy improvements over the state-of-the-art teacher models. The benefits thus motivate us to further explore the use of a powerful ensemble of teachers for more accurate student model training. We also propose some novel techniques to facilitate ensembled CTR prediction, including teacher gating and early stopping by distillation loss. We conduct comprehensive experiments against 12 existing models and across three industrial datasets. Both offline and online A/B testing results show the effectiveness of our KD-based training strategy.},

abstract = {Recent recommender systems have started to employ knowledge distillation, which is a model compression technique distilling knowledge from a cumbersome model (teacher) to a compact model (student), to reduce inference latency while maintaining performance. The state-of-the-art methods have only focused on making the student model to accurately imitate the predictions of the teacher model. They have a limitation in that the prediction results incompletely reveal the teacher's knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge distillation framework for recommender system, called DE-RRD, which enables the student model to learn from the latent knowledge encoded in the teacher model as well as from the teacher's predictions. Concretely, DE-RRD consists of two methods: 1) Distillation Experts (DE) that directly transfers the latent knowledge from the teacher model. DE exploits "experts" and a novel expert selection strategy for effectively distilling the vast teacher's knowledge to the student with limited capacity. 2) Relaxed Ranking Distillation (RRD) that transfers the knowledge revealed from the teacher's prediction with consideration of the relaxed ranking orders among items. Our extensive experiments show that DE-RRD outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors and achieves comparable or even better performance to that of the teacher model with faster inference time.},

abstract = {The task of session search focuses on using interaction data to improve relevance for the user's next query at the session level. In this paper, we formulate session search as a personalization task under the framework of learning to rank. Personalization approaches re-rank results to match a user model. Such user models are usually accumulated over time based on the user's browsing behaviour. We use a pre-computed and transparent set of user models based on concepts from the social science literature. Interaction data are used to map each session to these user models. Novel features are then estimated based on such models as well as sessions' interaction data. Extensive experiments on test collections from the TREC session track show statistically significant improvements over current session search algorithms.},
