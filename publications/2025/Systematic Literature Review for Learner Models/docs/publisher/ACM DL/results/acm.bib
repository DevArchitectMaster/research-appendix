abstract = {An Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) is an educational software that provides personal assistance for students, allowing them to learn at their own pace. This is possible because ITSs are able to map the learners' knowledge to create a student model. Most of the tutors use a Bayesian Network (BN) to perform this task, due to their ability to deal with uncertain data. However, classic static BNs are unable to model data, such as the student's knowledge, that changes over time. Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) are an interesting option in this case, because they are a special type of BN that reasons over time. This paper presents an architecture of DBN that aims at inferring student's algebraic knowledge. This network was constructed based on a concept map, which was developed with the goal of structuring the algebraic knowledge, i. e. defining relationships among concepts. The proposed DBN was evaluated with the help of an expert in order to verify the ability of the network to predict the student's knowledge on the application of operations to solve 1st degree equations. This DBN is being integrated into an web-based ITS for algebra learning.},

abstract = {In Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) systems, students work in groups interacting by using computers. Each member of the team behaves in a particular way to collaborate with others, manifesting a particular learning style. In this paper we propose a new approach for automatically creating student groups in CSCL systems by considering their individual learning styles. Data mining techniques are applied to discover which existent combinations of learning styles lead to a better performance. The discovered knowledge will be used by a software agent to propose the creation of the most promising new groups. The approach also considers the creation and maintenance of a user model for each student and a group model for each team. The assistant agent will be implemented in an existing CSCL tool, and its performance will be validated with real students.},

abstract = {Empirical studies of adaptive annotation in the educational context have demonstrated that it can help students to acquire knowledge faster, improve learning outcomes, reduce navigational overhead, and encourage non-sequential navigation. Over the last 8 years we have explored a lesser known effect of adaptive annotation -- its ability to significantly increase student engagement in working with non-mandatory educational content. In the presence of adaptive link annotation, students tend to access significantly more learning content; they stay with it longer, return to it more often and explore a wider variety of learning resources. This talk will present an overview of our exploration of the addictive links effect in many course-long studies, which we ran in several domains (C, SQL and Java programming), for several types of learning content (quizzes, problems, interactive examples). The first part of the talk will review our exploration of a more traditional knowledge-based personalization approach and the second part will focus on more recent studies of social navigation and open social student modeling.},

abstract = {We propose two methods for exploratory image search systems using gaze data for continuous learning of the users' interests and relevance calculation. The first system uses the fixation time over the images selected by gaze in the search results pages, whereas the second one utilizes the fixation time over the clicked images and fixations over the non-selected images on the results page. A user model is trained and continuously updated from the gaze input throughout the whole session in both systems. We conducted an experiment with 24 users, each performing four search tasks using the proposed systems and compared the results to a baseline system, which does not employ any gaze data. The Gaze feedback system users viewed 22.35% more images than the users of the baseline system. A high correlation between the number of saved images and the satisfaction with the results was observed in data collected from the users of a mouse feedback system enriched by gaze data. The results show that including the gaze data into the relevance calculation in both cases increases the degree of satisfaction with the search results compared with the baseline.},

abstract = {When a user learns to use a new device, her understanding of it evolves. A progressive comparison of the evolving user models towards the device target model, for analysing learning, involves determining the behavioral proximity between them. To quantify the gap between a user model and a target model, we introduce an edit distance metric for measuring their behavioral proximity using a bisimulation-based equivalence relation. We define edit distance to be the minimum number of edges and states with incident edges required to be deleted from and/or added to a user model to make it bisimilar to the target model. We propose an algorithm to compute edit distance between two models and employ the heuristic procedure on experimental data for computing edit distance between target and user models. The data is organised into two experiments depending on the device the user interacted with: (a) a simple device resembling a vending machine and (b) a close to real-world vehicle transmission model. The results validate our proposed metric as edit distance converges with progressive user learning, increases for erroneous learning, and remains unchanged indicating no learning.},

For these possibilities to unfold, the expertise and collaboration of many specialists will be necessary to improve data collection, to foster the development of better predictive models, and to assure models are interpretable and actionable. The big data collected from MOOCs needs to be bigger, not in its height (number of students) but in its width more meta-data and information on learners' cognitive and self-regulatory states needs to be collected in addition to correctness and completion rates. This more detailed articulation will help open up the black box approach to machine learning models where prediction is the primary goal. Instead, a data-driven learner model approach uses fine grain data that is conceived and developed from cognitive principles to build explanatory models with practical implications to improve student learning.},

There are differences in the properties of each individual such as differences in skills, prior knowledge, ... etc. These characteristics must be measured to display the content that is suitable to individual needs of student. There are different e-assessment models that are appropriate for discovering the prior knowledge and skills. The main objective of this research is to build an e-assessment model for Personal and Intelligent Assessment using Test (PIAT) to facilitate the evaluation process and measure the students' proficiency with more accuracy and store it in the student's profile for later use in the process of adapting content material to individual student needs. On one hand the model can help the instructors to develop the test by determining the objectives, creation and reuse of the test items. On the other hand the model can provide a personal test environment to the student. It generates the appropriate questions in an adaptive way, based on the student's model. The PIAT model is based on two theories. The first theory is Revised Bloom's Taxonomy (RBT) and the second theory is Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM).},

Therefore, the user interface should be adapted to the needs of each geographical location to provide optimal user experience.

abstract = {Multiplayer Serious Games are a promising concept to combine the features of Serious Games with the concept of collaborative learning. Multiplayer games, however, are hard to model, especially as interaction between players is often hard to predict. For the design of multiplayer Serious Games, especially considering adaptation algorithms for multiplayer Serious Games, exhaustive tests are desirable. As real players are often hard to obtain, simulation of players might be a solution. In this paper we propose an approach to simulate human player behavior in collaborative multiplayer Serious Games. Our approach considers behavior in terms of gaming (player model), learning (learner model), and collaboration and teamwork (interaction model). The aim of our model is to have a sound foundation of realistic player behavior as a basis for evaluation of adaptation mechanisms in collaborative multiplayer Serious Games. We implemented our approach as an extension of the collaborative multiplayer Serious Game 'Escape From Wilson Island' and carried out a first evaluation. The results are promising as they indicate that it is possible to soundly and reproducibly simulate player behavior based on a player model, player skills as well as on teamwork and communication.},

abstract = {Evaluating and optimizing an interactive system (like search engines, recommender and advertising systems) from historical data against a predefined online metric is challenging, especially when that metric is computed from user feedback such as clicks and payments. The key challenge is counterfactual in nature: we only observe a user's feedback for actions taken by the system, but we do not know what that user would have reacted to a different action. The golden standard to evaluate such metrics of a user-interacting system is online A/B experiments (a.k.a. randomized controlled experiments), which can be expensive in terms of both time and engineering resources. Offline evaluation/optimization (sometimes referred to as off-policy learning in the literature) thus becomes critical, aiming to evaluate the same metrics without running (many) expensive A/B experiments on live users. One approach to offline evaluation is to build a user model that simulates user behavior (clicks, purchases, etc.) under various contexts, and then evaluate metrics of a system with this simulator. While being straightforward and common in practice, the reliability of such model-based approaches relies heavily on how well the user model is built. Furthermore, it is often difficult to know a priori whether a user model is good enough to be trustable.Recent years have seen a growing interest in another solution to the offline evaluation problem. Using statistical techniques like importance sampling and doubly robust estimation, the approach can give unbiased estimates of metrics for a wide range of problems. It enjoys other benefits as well. For example, it often allows data scientists to obtain a confidence interval for the estimate to quantify the amount of uncertainty; it does not require building user models, so is more robust and easier to apply. All these benefits make the approach particularly attractive to a wide range of problems. Successful applications have been reported in the last few years by some of the industrial leaders.This tutorial gives a review of the basic theory and representative techniques. Applications of these techniques are illustrated through several case studies done at Microsoft and Yahoo!.},

abstract = {The learning managements systems (LMS)s that are widely used to provide access to educational opportunities on the Web are limited by a text based, linear presentation of course materials and the standard temporal restrictions in the traditional classroom. Making a fundamental change in how course materials are presented and interfaced with can make educational opportunities available to a broader spectrum of people with diverse abilities and various circumstances. We have developed a graph-based approach to presenting the learning materials of a course using a system called ENABLE [6, 7] with three major goals: (1) facilitate restructuring a set of synchronous classroom materials into a dynamic online system, (2) provide algorithms to analyze and enhance student performance as well as provide insights to the instructor concerning the efficacy of the learning items and their organization, and (3) identify ways to use data from an existing linear, temporal based course presentation to train predictive models for a course that allows individual flexibility in the ordering of the material. This work demonstrates the possibility of presenting course materials in a graphical way that expresses important relations and provides support for manipulating the order and timing of those materials. The graphical course map adds a new approach to making education accessible to people from many different spectrums of ability that respond and interface better with visual representations and those who will benefit from the removal of temporal limitations.},

We offer an approach that, in addition to providing visualisations of their learning, allows learners to propose changes to their learner model. This aims to help improve the accuracy of the learner model by taking into account student viewpoints on their learning, while also promoting learner reflection on their learning as part of a discussion of the content of their learner model. This aligns well with recent calls for learning analytics for learners. Building on previous research showing that learners will use open learner models, we here investigate their initial reactions to open learner model features to identify the likelihood of uptake in contexts where an open learner model is offered on an optional basis. We focus on university students' perceptions of a range of visualisations and their stated preferences for a facility to view evidence for the learner model data and to propose changes to the values.},

abstract = {Various e-learning systems that provide electronic textbooks are gathering data on large numbers of student reading interactions. This data can potentially be used to model student knowledge acquisition. However, reading activity is often overlooked in canonical student modeling. Prior studies modeling learning from reading either estimate student knowledge at the end of all reading activities, or use quiz performance data with expert-crafted knowledge components (KCs). In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamic modeling of student knowledge is feasible and that automatic text analysis can be applied to save expert effort. We propose a data-driven approach for dynamic student modeling in textbook-based learning. We formulate the problem of modeling learning from reading as a reading-time prediction problem, reconstruct existing popular student models (such as Knowledge Tracing) and explore two automatic text analysis approaches (bag-of-words-based and latent semantic-based) to build the KC model. We evaluate the proposed framework using a dataset collected from a Human-Computer Interaction course. Results show that our approach for reading modeling is plausible; the proposed Knowledge Tracing-based student model reliably outperforms baselines and the latent semantic-based approach can be a promising way to construct a KC model. Serving as the first step to model dynamic knowledge in textbook-based learning, our framework can be applied to a broader context of open-corpus personalized learning.},

An important element in SRL that can bring a better understanding of these tools and their effects concerns to learning motivation theories. In this work I connect these aspects and propose to study the effects of OLM and motivational factors drawn from learning motivation theories. To account for a broader spectrum of OLM representations, I proposed to explore the addition of social information and different levels of granularity in the OLM. I propose to evaluate different designs and then to evaluate the resulting interface in field studies. With the proposed work I expect to gain a deeper understanding of the effects of OLM tools which can be used to guide the development of better tools, better personalization and adaptive mechanisms, better use of such tools in supporting Self-Regulated Learning, and ultimately impact positively in learning.},

abstract = {Digital games can be potent problem solving environments which afford discovery learning through thoughtful exploration [1, 2]. As such, game microworlds facilitate self-regulated learning through sandbox elements in which students have agency in individualizing their pathways of interaction [3]. These agency-driven environments can support learning via individual discovery of problem space constraints and solutions, particularly through boundary testing and productive failure [cf. 4]. Thus, modeling of user interaction in digital learning games can provide considerable insight into emergent trajectories of discovery-based progression, in which equally engaged players may interact differently with the system. To this end, this research leverages educational data mining (EDM) [5] to investigate organic player trajectories of thoughtful exploration (around boundary testing and productive failure) in a learning gamespace. We align behavioral coding with log file data to automatically detect sequences of thoughtful exploration (TE) in play. Results include a robust predictive model of event-stream TE, with multiple trajectories of emergent student behavior-offering insight into organic learning pathways through the game-based problem space, and informing iterative design in optimization of user experience and student engagement.},

abstract = {Traditional Knowledge Tracing, which traces students' knowledge of each decomposed individual skill, has been a popular learner model for adaptive tutoring. Typically, a student is guided to the next skill when the student's knowledge on current skill is inferred as mastery. Unfortunately, this traditional approach no longer suffices to model complex skill practices where simple decompositions can not capture potential additional skills underlying the context as a whole. In such cases, mastery should only be granted when a student not only understands the basic of a skill but also can fluently apply a skill in varied application contexts. In this thesis, we aim to propose a data-driven approach to construct learner models considering different skill application contexts for tracing deeper knowledge, primarily based on Bayesian Networks. We aim to conduct novel, comprehensive, ``deep" evaluations, including internal data-drive evaluations, and external end-user evaluations examining the real world impact for students' personalized learning.},

abstract = {In exploratory search tasks, users usually start with considerable uncertainty about their search goals, and so the search intent of the user may be volatile as the user is constantly learning and reformulating her search hypothesis during the search. This may lead to a noticeable concept drift in the relevance feedback given by the user. We formulate a Bayesian regression model for predicting the accuracy of each individual user feedback and thus find outliers in the feedback data set. To accompany this model, we introduce a timeline interface that visualizes the feedback history to the user and gives her suggestions on which past feedback is likely in need of adjustment. This interface also allows the user to adjust the feedback accuracy inferences made by the model. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the performance of the new user model outperforms a simpler baseline and that the performance approaches that of an oracle, given a small amount of additional user interaction. A user study shows that the proposed modeling technique, combined with the timeline interface, made it easier for the users to notice and correct mistakes in their feedback, resulted in better and more diverse recommendations, allowed users to easier find items they liked, and was more understandable.},

Web advertising includes listing advertisement, which shows advertisements related to a search keyword, and interest-matching advertising, which shows advertisements relevant to a user's search content and browsing history. However, it is difficult to show effective Web advertising to potential purchasers using the technique based on conventional keyword matching. In this paper, we consider a recommender system for Web advertising based on analysis of the user's potential interests. In particular, we focus on a user model with potential interest for a certain website by analyzing browsing history. We introduce a Web advertising recommender system that is based not only based on keyword matching, but also on reported learning results. In addition, we argue the influence of the period for acquisition of the browsing history, which is taken when the users' model is learned.},

In this research study, we explored users' perceptions regarding the uptake and effective use of an open learner model visualisation prototype tool -- Doubtfire++, in facilitating student self-regulated learning supporting Task-oriented Portfolio teaching and learning. We investigated students' perceptions of setting appropriate goals, monitoring performance and reflecting on learning through the use of the visualisation tool to support students in becoming self-regulated learners. Data was collected from 134 users using an online survey questionnaire. Results show that Doubtfire++ positively impacted users' perceptions of setting appropriate goals, monitoring performance and reflecting on learning. User role, experience using Doubtfire++, frequency of using Doubtfire++ and different teaching units significantly impacted respondents' perceptions whereas gender and familiarity with information visualisation techniques had no impact on respondents' perceptions. The results indicate that the approach can facilitate student self-regulated learning, especially for those new to Task-oriented Portfolio teaching and learning of programming units.},

Prior knowledge can improve machine learning models by indicating relevant variables and parameter values. Yet, this prior knowledge is often tacit and only available from domain experts. We present a novel approach that uses interactive visualization to elicit the tacit prior knowledge and uses it to improve the accuracy of prediction models. The main component of our approach is a user model that models the domain expert's knowledge of the relevance of different features for a prediction task. In particular, based on the expert's earlier input, the user model guides the selection of the features on which to elicit user's knowledge next. The results of a controlled user study show that the user model significantly improves prior knowledge elicitation and prediction accuracy, when predicting the relative citation counts of scientific documents in a specific domain.},

OSSM is a recent extension of Open Student Modeling (OSM), a popular technology in the area of personalized learning systems. While in traditional personalized systems, student models were hidden "under the hood" and used to personalize the educational process; open student modeling introduced the ability to view and modify the state of students' own knowledge to support reflection, self-organized learning, and system transparency. Open Social Student Modeling takes this idea one step further by allowing students to explore each other's models or an aggregated model of the class. The idea to make OSM social was originally suggested and explored by Bull [1; 2]. Over the last few years, our team explored several approaches to present OSSM in a highly visual form and evaluated these approaches in a sequence of classroom and lab studies. I will present a summary of this work introducing such systems as QuizMap [3], Progressor [4], and Mastery Grids [5] and reviewing most interesting research evidence collected by the studies.},

abstract = {The accuracy of learner model is the heart of any Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). More intelligence in the ITS needs a more accurate learner model. In the earlier versions of ITS, the student must submit a test before using the ITS. That test was used to build the student model, which contains information about the knowledge of the student, his/her misconceptions, preferences and other related issues. However, this method doesn't work efficiently for school students, because one test canfit accurately evaluate their knowledge and misconceptions. In this research, we implement a system (web application) to get the student model for school students by allowing the students, parents, and instructors to add their assessment and feedback to the model. Then the system uses these multi-entries together with the traditional test to build an enhanced student model (smart learner model). Furthermore, in order to support collaborative learning, the implemented system gives the student the access to open his/her model for other instructors and peers. The proposed system has been applied on a group of students, their parents and instructors. According to the obtained results and the surveys, the studentfis knowledge has been improved in many students. also the students, parents, instructors found the system to be useful, interesting and easy to use. Furthermore, all parties were happy to be engaged in the educational process.},

The numerous existing systems generally integrate three models: learner, domain and adaptation. But, how are these models built and what are the challenges for designers and developers? To answer this question, a study of 50 adaptive educational hypermedia systems was conducted, by comparing each of the three models. This paper presents the results of these comparisons and discusses them. Limits are also highlighted and some avenues of solution are proposed.

abstract = {The gold standard for identifying more effective pedagogical approaches is to perform an experiment. Unfortunately, frequently a hypothesized alternate way of teaching does not yield an improved effect. Given the expense and logistics of each experiment, and the enormous space of potential ways to improve teaching, it would be highly preferable if it were possible to estimate in advance of running a study whether an alternative teaching strategy would improve learning. This is true even in learning at scale situations, since even if it is logistically easier to recruit a large number of subjects, it remains a high stakes environment because the experiment is impacting many real students. For certain classes of alternate teaching approaches, such as new ways to sequence existing material, it is possible to build student models that can be used as simulators to estimate the performance of learners under new proposed teaching methods. However, existing methods for doing so can overestimate the performance of new teaching methods. We instead propose the Robust Evaluation Matrix (REM) method which explicitly considers model mismatch between the student model used to derive the teaching strategy and that used as a simulator to evaluate the teaching strategy effectiveness. We then present two case studies from a fractions intelligent tutoring system and from a concept learning task from prior work that show how REM could be used both to detect when a new instructional policy may not be effective on actual students and to detect when it may be effective in improving student learning.},

abstract = {The digital economy is based on data sharing yet citizens have little control about how their personal data is being used. While data management during web and app-based use is already a challenge, as the Internet of Things (IoT) scales up, the number of devices accessing and requiring personal data will go beyond what a person can manually assess in terms of data access requests. Therefore, new approaches are needed for managing privacy preferences at scale and providing active consent around data sharing that can improve fidelity of operation in alignment with user intent. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel agent-based approach to negotiate the permission to exchange private data between users and services. Our agent negotiates based on learned preferences from actual users. To evaluate our agent-based approach, we developed an experimental tool to run on people's own smartphones, where users were asked to share their private, real data (e.g. photos, contacts, etc) under various conditions. The agent autonomously negotiates potential agreements for the user, which they can refine by manually continuing the negotiation. The agent learns from these interactions and updates the user model in subsequent interactions. We find that the agent is able to effectively capture the preferences and negotiate on the user's behalf but, surprisingly, does not reduce user engagement with the system. Understanding how interaction interplays with agent-based automation is a key component to successful deployment of negotiating agents in real-life settings and within the IoT context in particular.},

These dancing features can be presented back to the students as feedback, in the form of i) summaries, ii) visualisations or iii) narratives.

abstract = {Open Learner Models (OLM) show the learner model to users to assist their self-regulated learning by, for example, helping prompt reflection, facilitating planning and supporting navigation. OLMs can show different levels of detail of the underlying learner model, and can also structure the information differently. As a result, a trade-off may exist between the potential for better support for learning and the complexity of the information shown. This paper investigates students' perceptions about whether offering more and richer information in an OLM will result in more effective support for their self-regulated learning. In a first study, questionnaire responses relating to designs for six visualisations of varying complexity led to the implementation of three variations on one of the designs. A second controlled study involved students interacting with these variations. The study revealed that the most useful variation for searching for suitable learning material was a visualisation combining a basic coloured grid, an extended bar chart-like visualisation indicating related concepts, and a learning gauge.},

abstract = {To serve large user populations, autonomous intervention systems (i.e. intelligent agents) are being developed to play more active roles such as fitness coaches and clinical disease prevention aids. Although generic user models have been developed, users may require extensive individualization to meet their personal needs. Machine learning techniques may be applied to learn tailored intervention policies for users. However, traditional machine learning requires significant amounts of data to learn an optimal policy. For wearable technology, this may mean probing the user to perform some activity and gauging user response. This paper presents a feasible intervention system model and discusses learners for tailoring user intervention policies. We examine how similar the general user model has to be with respect to the tailored model in order for our learner to perform well.},

These methods often require intermittent attention requests with manual data input. This may cause unnecessary burden to the user, leading to annoyance, frustration and possible application abandonment. We designed a novel method that uses on-screen alert dialogs to transform recurrent smartphone usage sessions into moments of data contributions and evaluate how accurately machine learning can reduce unintended interruptions. We collected sensor data from 48 participants during a 4-week long deployment and analysed how personal device usage can be considered in scheduling data inputs. We show that up to 81.7% of user interactions with the alert dialogs can be accurately predicted using user clusters, and up to 75.5% of unintended interruptions can be prevented and rescheduled. Our approach can be leveraged by applications that require self-reports on a frequent basis and may provide a better longitudinal QS experience.},

abstract = {Learning mathematics is closely related with the fact that the student knows how to solve problems. There are cognitive theories that say that problem solving teaching requires techniques based on the student's cognitive ability, linked to the type of problems or examples (when cognitive ability is low) that must work. This process requires automated tools to identify the characteristics of the students in order to provide more personalized teaching strategies and also manage feedback that helps the student and the teacher to identify their achievements. These types of automated tools are known as cognitive tutors, which are intelligent tutoring systems, with the particularity of being focused on providing individualized support to students to improve their complex cognitive skills, through problem-solving practice. On the other hand, it is considered that algebra, in addition to arithmetic, are the areas that serve as the basis for the understanding of many mathematical subjects. Therefore, in this thesis project a semi-automated tool is proposed, by means of which, the different modules of a cognitive tutor are implemented, following an instructional design for solving algebra problems, through the management of gamification and game strategies based on the techniques of computational theory of tangible user interfaces. For the student model module, a fuzzy model is used to detect and classify the student's cognitive ability. In modules of model of the domain and the tutor model, fuzzy cognitive maps are defined and implemented to determine, respectively, the activities related to the different types of problems related to various algebra topics and to determine the pedagogical activities that the student must follow in each of the stages of problem solving.},

abstract = {One of the biggest challenges of Adaptive e-learning systems is learner modelling. The learner model should represent the learner's characteristics as faithfully as possible in order to provide adaptive learning. Among these characteristics, the learner's knowledge is considered to be the core characteristic of the learner model, as adaptive e-learning systems are centered on the learner's knowledge, since acquiring « knowledge » about a specific domain or concept is considered the main goal of learning and instruction. In this paper, we propose a novel adult learner's knowledge model using ontologies and rule reasoning, by trying to define the different components that construct the learner's knowledge in an exhaustive yet a simple way. The proposed model takes into account different elements of the learner's knowledge, such as the different knowledge types and categories, the learner's prior knowledge accumulated through his/her experiences, his/her misconceptions, errors and the previously learned but forgotten knowledge.},

Identifying a resource of relevant information to a specific context becomes a real challenge. In the course of our work we are interested in recommendation of pedagogical resources within a learning ecosystem. We have chosen to model a learning ecosystem as a system of information systems (SoIS). In this SoIS we introduce a resource recommender system. This system is based on users' votes (learners, teachers), and the similarity between the description of pedagogical resources and the learners' profile. In our approach, we take into account the willingness to collaborate. Therefore, we exploit a collaboration model that supports learning ecosystem to answer the demand for questions such as, who collaborates with whom, how, when, why, on what and where, etc. The work presented in this paper is focused on at recommendation of pedagogical resources within a learning ecosystem.},

abstract = {The paper presents semantic clustering and artificial neural network (ANN) based learning analytics software agent for personalised adaptive multi-agent learning system. First of all, systematic literature review on application of ANN to personalise learning in Web of Science database was performed. After that, methodology of application of ANN and semantic clustering of learning material in personalised adaptive multi-agent learning system is presented. In the paper, personalisation in multi-agent learning system is based on learning styles model that requires the use of psychological questionnaire to determine student's learning styles. The results of filling in the questionnaire could be incorrect since some students may answer the questionnaire dishonestly, irresponsibly, or make mistakes in self-diagnosis. This results in creation of an incorrect student's model. This causes the system to provide suboptimal learning objects and scenarios to the student. The authors present a model of ANN based learning analytics agent to be used in the system. Proposed agent uses ANN to associate students' learning styles with their real behaviour within the learning environment. The key factor describing the behaviour of students within the system is the learning content they seek out independently. Clustering the visited documents based on semantic content categorizes students into groups. Belonging to a semantic cluster is one of the inputs that can be used to train ANN agent. After training, the agent could identify potentially faulty student models by looking for anomalous behaviour for those learning styles. Such problems can be resolved by providing alternative learning objects or scenarios to the students and observing their choices.1},

SIAL is a Model-Based System as its Domain Model is an Automated Theorem Prover (ATP) for First Order Logic (FOL). This allows SIAL to perform an accurate error diagnosis process while, at the same time, accepting several equivalent valid solutions to the same problem. This feature adds a general open-ended solution capability to SIAL which facilitates the adaptation to the students' way of thinking and allows them to explore and take their own decisions (and make their own mistakes). The Pedagogical Model of SIAL takes advantage of the error diagnosis capabilities of the Domain Model to offer a learner-adaptive tutorial action, according to the user cognitive profile. An example of the knowledge involved in the assessment of the next tutorial action based on the student model, and how SIAL adapts its behaviour to the student's assessed cognitive capabilities, is included. Some data obtained after a period of use of SIAL is also presented.},

abstract = {Machine learning? is a powerful tool in modeling historic user data and converting it into a computational user model. However, it is nearly impossible for a machine learning process to have access to all data pertaining to a user. This leads to potential gaps in the user model produced. Thus, involving the user in overseeing and controlling the modelling process may be considered as a worthwhile goal. This form of user model control is often referred to as scrutability in the personalization research domain. The approach proposed in this research is to combine the benefits of machine learning driven user modelling and scrutable user control in the modelling process. This PhD is at its midpoint and is currently focused on building the model while taking into consideration how user feedback may be incorporated. This feedback is solicited iteratively, enabling the ML process to retrain with the benefit of the user input. The early results of the experimental work show promising prediction accuracy results.},

With all the potential benefits of these tools " productivity increase and improved group communication " come significant challenges. Specifically, users find it hard to focus their attention on content that is relevant to them due to the load of conversational content. This load can be handled by personalized content presentation and summarization mitigated by user profiling. We present an unsupervised approach for implicitly modeling group chat users through a combination of a probabilistic topic model and social analysis. We evaluate our approach by testing it on a task of conversation participation prediction, serving as a proxy for anticipating user interests, and show that by utilizing our approach, a system successfully predicts users participation in conversations. We further analyze the contribution of the various user model components and show them to be significant.},

abstract = {Learner models are a key element of many intelligent computer-based assessment and training approaches. Oftentimes, these models, the processes, and evidences are hidden from the learners and even teachers. Open learner models (OLM) are intended to make the underlying logic of a model as well as the evidences that contributed to a certain student appraisal transparent to its users. Furthermore, they are intended to support learning in a formative sense, aiming to help learners to self-monitor, plan, focus, and work independently as well as to communicate and negotiate appraisals with peers and teachers. We present a use case where Lea's OLM uses evidence from a speed-reading training application, to build the model. Learners use a persuasion function to interact with the system and maintain the OLM. The study showed that students are able to use it efficiently in order to make their model more accurate. We argue that persuasion, and other interactive maintenance features, are a strong approach to improve a transparent and accurate learner modelling, specifically when the underlying evidences are manifold and from multiple, partially unclear sources. Moreover, we found that the possibility to interact with the system on an individual basis and to have the possibility to intervene in the process is a strong means of making educational systems more personalized},

abstract = {Guiding students to the learning activities that are most appropriate for their current level of knowledge is one of the goals that adaptive educational systems tried to achieve during the last decades. Recently, several attempts have been made to use Open Learner Models (OLM) as a tool for achieving this goal. While the original goal of OLM is to help students reflect about their own learning process, extending OLM with navigation support functionality enables students to take immediate actions towards improving their knowledge. In this work, we attempted to extend the navigation support functionality of OLM by developing a fine-grained OLM that offers student knowledge visualization on both topic and concept levels. The fine-grained OLM enables students to directly explore connections between their knowledge and available learning activities, making an informed decision about their next learning steps. To assess the impact of the new type of OLM, we evaluated several versions of it in a classroom study, while also comparing it with data from our earlier studies that featured a coarse-grained OLM. Our results suggest that the fine-grained OLM considerably impacts student choice of learning activities, making student learning more efficient. We also found that the specific design features of fine-grained OLM could affect students' confidence and persistence while selecting and attempting the learning activities.},

Creating student models that leverage gaze information holds significant promise for game-based learning environments. This paper introduces a gaze-enhanced student modeling framework that incorporates student eye tracking to dynamically predict students' performance in a game-based learning environment for microbiology education, CRYSTAL ISLAND. The gaze-enhanced student modeling framework was investigated in a study comparing a gaze-enhanced student model with a baseline student model that does not utilize student eye-tracking. Results of a study conducted with 65 college students interacting with the CRYSTAL ISLAND game-based learning environment indicate that the gaze-enhanced student model significantly outperforms the baseline model in dynamically predicting student problem-solving performance. The findings suggest that incorporating gaze into student modeling can contribute to a new generation of student models for game-based learning environments.},

Knowledge distillation (KD) was shown to be successful in image recognition to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency. We propose a KD technique for learning to rank problems, called ranking distillation (RD). Specifically, we train a smaller student model to learn to rank documents/items from both the training data and the supervision of a larger teacher model. The student model achieves a similar ranking performance to that of the large teacher model, but its smaller model size makes the online inference more efficient. RD is flexible because it is orthogonal to the choices of ranking models for the teacher and student. We address the challenges of RD for ranking problems. The experiments on public data sets and state-of-the-art recommendation models showed that RD achieves its design purposes: the student model learnt with RD has less than an half size of the teacher model while achieving a ranking performance similar tothe teacher model and much better than the student model learnt without RD.},

The teacher model generates the output distribution called soft label to make a label for the unlabeled data stream and the student model trained by the unlabeled data stream with the soft label from teacher model.

abstract = {With the development of sophisticated learning environments and learner-centric didactic approaches, personalized learning is in high demand. Personalization in learning environments occurs when such systems fit the learner profiles, which help in increasing their performance and quality of learning. Personalized learning refers to the pedagogy where the pace of learning, the instructional preferences and the learning objects are optimized as per the needs of each learner. To support customization, recommender systems can be used to recommend appropriate learning objects (LOs) corresponding to the learner attributes. This paper proposes an architecture of an Adaptive Personalized Learning Environment (APLE) and its features. APLE assists the learners by content recommendation and adapts to the learning preferences and performance of the learner. It has three modules such as Learner modelling Unit (LModU), Content Managing Unit (CMU) and Learner Monitoring Unit (LMU). LModU creates a Learner Model (LM) from the learner attributes.The system proposes to represent learner attributes as an ontology and learner modelling using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. The LMU should perform the knowledge assessment of the learner and monitor their changing preferences. CMU got two components, LO Manager and Content Recommendation Engine (CRE). LO Manager is responsible for creating the metadata corresponding to the learning resource following the IEEE LOM specification. CRE is an expert system which will map the learner attribute with the LOs. Currently, the CRE is implemented as a rule-based prediction engine where the rules represent the association between each LOM field with the learner attributes. This on-going research work aims at answering questions regarding the feasibility and effectiveness of mapping LO attributes and learner attributes.},

abstract = {Multi-label image classification is a fundamental but challenging task towards general visual understanding. Existing methods found the region-level cues (e.g., features from RoIs) can facilitate multi-label classification. Nevertheless, such methods usually require laborious object-level annotations (i.e., object labels and bounding boxes) for effective learning of the object-level visual features. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient deep framework to boost multi-label classification by distilling knowledge from weakly-supervised detection task without bounding box annotations. Specifically, given the image-level annotations, (1) we first develop a weakly-supervised detection (WSD) model, and then (2) construct an end-to-end multi-label image classification framework augmented by a knowledge distillation module that guides the classification model by the WSD model according to the class-level predictions for the whole image and the object-level visual features for object RoIs. The WSD model is the teacher model and the classification model is the student model. After this cross-task knowledge distillation, the performance of the classification model is significantly improved and the efficiency is maintained since the WSD model can be safely discarded in the test phase. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets (MS-COCO and NUS-WIDE) show that our framework achieves superior performances over the state-of-the-art methods on both performance and efficiency.},

We applied seven different supervised learning classification algorithms, using personality scores for each dimension (high or low) as target values, and analyzed the results. The findings were encouraging and revealed that most of Big Five personality dimensions can in fact be predicted using mainly educational data features, which could have an added value on unobtrusive dynamic learner modelling.},

abstract = {Integrating external knowledge into the recommendation system has attracted increasing attention in both industry and academic communities. Recent methods mostly take the power of neural network for effective knowledge representation to improve the recommendation performance. However, the heavy deep architectures in existing models are usually incorporated in an embedded manner, which may greatly increase the model complexity and lower the runtime efficiency.To simultaneously take the power of deep learning for external knowledge modeling as well as maintaining the model efficiency at test time, we reformulate the problem of recommendation with external knowledge into a generalized distillation framework. The general idea is to free the complex deep architecture into a separate model, which is only used in the training phrase, while abandoned at test time. In particular, in the training phrase, the external knowledge is processed by a comprehensive teacher model to produce valuable information to teach a simple and efficient student model. Once the framework is learned, the teacher model is abandoned, and only the succinct yet enhanced student model is used to make fast predictions at test time. In this article, we specify the external knowledge as user review, and to leverage it in an effective manner, we further extend the traditional generalized distillation framework by designing a Selective Distillation Network (SDNet) with adversarial adaption and orthogonality constraint strategies to make it more robust to noise information.Extensive experiments verify that our model can not only improve the performance of rating prediction, but also can significantly reduce time consumption when making predictions as compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {A Digital twin is the virtual replica of a physical system. Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and prognostics of machines and products. Traditionally, building a digital twin requires many built-in sensors to monitor various physical phenomena associated with cyber-physical systems such as vibration, energy consumption, etc. However, many legacy manufacturing systems do not have multi-physics sensors built-in by default. Moreover, it might not be feasible to intrusively place sensors in these systems after they are manufactured. To bring the advantages of digitalization to legacy manufacturing systems, this paper contributes with an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based methodology to build digital twins using an indirect medium such as side-channels, which can localize anomalous faults and infer the quality of the products being manufactured while keeping itself up-to-date. We achieve this by exploring and utilizing the side-channels (emissions such as acoustics, power, magnetic, etc.) of the system that unintentionally reveal the cyber and physical state of the system. To validate our methodology, in this paper, we focus on building a digital twin model of a Fused-Deposition Modeling (FDM) based Cartesian additive manufacturing system. The proposed methodology achieves 83.09% accuracy in anomaly localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the possibility of modeling and maintaining a living digital twin of a manufacturing system by extracting information from the side-channels using low-end IoT sensors.},

abstract = {As services based on Machine Learning (ML) applications find increasing use, there is a growing risk of attack against such systems. Recently, adversarial machine learning has received a lot of attention, where an adversary is able to craft an input or manipulate an input to cause an ML system to misclassify. Another attack of concern is when an adversary with access to a ML model can reverse engineer attributes of a target class, creating a privacy concern, which is the subject of this paper. Such attacks use non-sensitive data obtainable by the adversary and the confidence levels returned by the ML model to infer sensitive attributes of the target user. Model Inversion attacks may be classified as white-box, where the ML model is known to the attacker, or black-box, where the adversary does not know the internals of the model. If the attacker has access to non-sensitive data of a target user, they can infer sensitive data by applying gradient ascent on the confidence returned by the model. Therefore, a black-box attack can be mounted by numerical approximations of the gradient to perform the gradient ascent. In this work, we present MLPrivacyGuard, a countermeasure against black-box model inversion attack is presented. This countermeasure consists of adding controlled noise to the output of the confidence function. It is important to preserve the accuracy of prediction/classification for the real users of the model while preventing attackers to infer sensitive data. This involves a trade-off between misclassification error and the effectiveness of defense. Based on experimental results, we demonstrate that when noise is injected with a long-tailed distribution, the objectives of low misclassification error with a strong defense can be attained as model inversion attacks are neutralized because numerical approximation of gradient ascent is unable to converge.},

abstract = {Attention plays an important role in the daily lives of people and especially in learning. It may be influenced by different factors since childhood or during the aging process because of deficits such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which is responsible of learning difficulties. Serious games for attention training may be helpful to develop self-regulation skills in attention training through a personalized game experience. It can provide children with appropriate guidance to develop their self-regulation skills while enhancing their cognitive functions such as attention. The transparency of the user model may help users (both children and tutors) to follow their progression, and to develop their learning strategy. In this paper, a pilot study was conducted to evaluate the assessment step of a developed attention training serious game. The objective was to study whether the transparency of the learner model influences the users' perception of their attention and self-regulate their learning. The primary results of the pilot experiment show that open learner model influences the decision of users on difficulty level preference that may be promising in self-regulated attention training.},

abstract = {Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are used for a varietyof software development tasks. Their complexity makes them chal-lenging to use though, especially for less experienced developers. In this paper, we outline our approach for an user-adaptive IDE that is able to track the interactions, recognize the user's intent and expertise, and provide relevant, personalized recommendations in real-time. To obtain a user model and provide recommendations, interaction data is processed in a two-stage process: first, we derive a bandit based global model of general task patterns from a dataset of labeled interactions. Second, when the user is working with the IDE, we apply a pre-trained classifier in real-time to get task labels from the user's interactions. With those and user feedback we fine-tune a local copy of the global model. As a result, we obtain a personalized user model which provides user-specific recommendations. We finally present various approaches for using these recommendations to adapt the IDE's interface. Modifications range from visual highlighting to task automation, including explanatory feedback.},

abstract = {Online academic reading assessments can test graduate students' reading ability, while the results of tests as a feedback can help students reflect on their own ability, realize their weaknesses, and then take actions to improve their ability. These behaviors form the basis of self-regulated learning ability. In this paper, a negotiated online reading assessment system is developed to provide students with the function of self-assessment and reflection. For designing the system, the authors use the concept of a negotiated learner model, so that students may negotiate with the system and try to reach an agreement. In order to explore the differences in students' learning behaviors in such a system, the authors used the hidden Markov Model to construct the behavioral model of students' self-regulated learning ability. Furthermore, the authors differentiated the negotiation behaviors of students with high and low self-regulated learning ability in the reading assessment system. The results showed that the students in the high and low self-regulated learning ability groups shared the behaviors of peer comparison and retesting. The high self-regulated learning group tended to transit among retesting, peer comparison, test reflection, and self-assessment. The students in the low self-regulated learning group tended to transit among retesting, peer comparison, viewing grades, and self-reflection. The results indicated that the students tended to re-test to negotiate with the system, and that the students in the high self-regulated learning group may reflect on learning through negotiation and further plan their learning strategies.},

It is worth noting that the learning system recommendation is different from the general recommendation. Not only the method, the evaluation standard of recommendation result is also different. We should not simply recommend to students the exercises they must or must not mastered, but recommend to them the learning resources they should have within the range of their abilities according to the theory of proximal development zone. We also use the bayesian knowledge tracing model to judge students' mastery of knowledge as the evaluation standard of this algorithm.},

While it is generally easier for assessors to conduct preference judgements than absolute judgements, it is often not practical to obtain preference judgements for all combinations of documents. However, this problem can be overcome if we can effectively utilise noisy and incomplete preference judgements such as those that can be obtained from crowdsourcing. Our measure, η, is based on a simple probabilistic user model of the labellers which assumes that each document is associated with a graded relevance score for a given query. We also consider situations where multiple preference probabilities, rather than preference labels, are given for each document pair. For example, in the absence of manual preference judgements, one might want to employ an ensemble of machine learning techniques to obtain such estimated probabilities. For this scenario, we propose another ranking evaluation measure called η_p $. Through simulated experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed measures η and η_p$ can evaluate rankings more reliably than τmbox- b$, a popular rank correlation measure.},

abstract = {Recently, deep learning-based saliency prediction methods have achieved significant accuracy improvements. However, they are hard to embed in practical multimedia applications due to large memory consumption and running time caused by complicated architectures. In addition, most methods are fine-tuned from pre-trained models for classification tasks, and networks cannot flexibly be transferred for a new task. In this paper, a condensed and randomly initialized student network is employed to achieve higher efficiency by transferring knowledge from complicated and well-trained teacher networks. This is the first use of knowledge distillation for efficient pixel-wise saliency prediction. Instead of directly minimizing Euclidean distance between feature maps, we propose two statistical representations of feature maps (i.e., first-order and second-order statistics) as knowledge. We conduct experiments on three kinds of teacher networks and four benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the teacher networks, the student networks achieve an acceleration ratio of 4.56-4.73. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed model achieves competitive accuracy with faster running speed (up to 4.38 times) and smaller model size (up to 93.27% reduction). We further embedded the proposed saliency prediction model into a video captioning application. The saliency-embedded approaches improve video captioning on all test metrics with a small complexity cost. The student-model embedded approach achieves 25% time saving with similar performance to the teacher embedded one.},

abstract = {In automatic speech recognition, performance gains can often be obtained by combining an ensemble of multiple models. However, this can be computationally expensive when performing recognition. Teacher–student learning alleviates this cost by training a single student model to emulate the combined ensemble behaviour. Only this student needs to be used for recognition. Previously investigated teacher–student criteria often limit the forms of diversity allowed in the ensemble, and only propagate information from the teachers to the student at the frame level. This paper addresses both of these issues by examining teacher–student learning within a sequence-level framework, and assessing the flexibility that these approaches offer. Various sequence-level teacher–student criteria are examined in this work, to propagate sequence posterior information. A training criterion based on the Kullback–Leibler KL-divergence between context-dependent state sequence posteriors is proposed that allows for a diversity of state cluster sets to be present in the ensemble. This criterion is shown to be an upper bound to a more general KL-divergence between word sequence posteriors, which places even fewer restrictions on the ensemble diversity, but whose gradient can be expensive to compute. These methods are evaluated on the augmented multi-party interaction AMI meeting transcription and MGB-3 television broadcast audio tasks.},

abstract = {Continuous and effective monitoring of chronic diseases and their associated treatments might have a decisive impact on reducing risks and improving life quality of patients. This, however, demands new and innovative methods for engineering systems that support the required capabilities. Research on the application of the novel concept of Digital Twin (DT) in healthcare might provide the means to revolutionize traditional medical practices. A DT comprises a set of virtual representations of both the structural elements and dynamics of any physical asset (e.g., a patient) throughout its lifecycle. In the healthcare domain, it might represent a significan step forward towards tightening and improving the interactions between systems, caregivers and patients. Moreover, integrating data-driven methods (e.g., Machine Learning) and DT could serve as a noteworthy mechanism to not only track patients' health continuously, but also to evaluate the application and evolution of medical treatments virtually. In this paper, we describe our vision for the application of DT in precision medicine. Our contributions are twofold. First, we describe our initial ideas for a reference model that leverages DT capabilities and research advances in self-adaptive systems and autonomic computing to engineer smart and fl xible software systems in healthcare. We expect these systems to alleviate complexity and assist in the planning and decision-making processes when applying medical treatments to patients by healthcare professionals. Then, we elaborate on the definitio of internal structures for DT to support precision medicine techniques in the context of continuous monitoring and personalized data-driven medical treatments.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student learning framework for the preprocessing of a speech recognizer, leveraging the online noise tracking capabilities of improved minima controlled recursive averaging IMCRA and deep learning of nonlinear interactions between speech and noise. First, a teacher model with deep architectures is built to learn the target of ideal ratio masks IRMs using simulated training pairs of clean and noisy speech data. Next, a student model is trained to learn an improved speech presence probability by incorporating the estimated IRMs from the teacher model into the IMCRA approach. The student model can be compactly designed in a causal processing mode having no latency with the guidance of a complex and noncausal teacher model. Moreover, the clean speech requirement, which is difficult to meet in real-world adverse environments, can be relaxed for training the student model, implying that noisy speech data can be directly used to adapt the regression-based enhancement model to further improve speech recognition accuracies for noisy speech collected in such conditions. Experiments on the CHiME-4 challenge task show that our best student model with bidirectional gated recurrent units BGRUs can achieve a relative word error rate WER reduction of 18.85% for the real test set when compared to unprocessed system without acoustic model retraining. However, the traditional teacher model degrades the performance of the unprocessed system in this case. In addition, the student model with a deep neural network DNN in causal mode having no latency yields a relative WER reduction of 7.94% over the unprocessed system with 670 times less computing cycles when compared to the BGRU-equipped student model. Finally, the conventional speech enhancement and IRM-based deep learning method destroyed the ASR performance when the recognition system became more powerful. While our proposed approach could still improve the ASR performance even in the more powerful recognition system.},

abstract = {Social robots are increasingly applied to support children’s learning, but how a robot can foster (or may hinder) learning is still not fully clear. One technique used by teachers is scaffolding, temporarily assisting learners to achieve new skills or levels of understanding they would not reach on their own. We ask if and how a social robot can be utilized to scaffold second-language learning of children at kindergarten age (4--7 years). Specifically, we explore an adapt-and-explain scaffolding strategy in which a robot acts as a peer-like tutor who dynamically adapts its behavior or the learning tasks to the cognitive and affective state of the child, and provides verbal explanations of these adaptations. An evaluation study with 40 children shows that children benefit from the learning adaptation and that the explanations have a positive effect especially for slower learners. Further, in 76% of all cases the robot managed to “re-engage” children who started to disengage from the learning interaction, helping them to achieve an overall higher learning gain. These findings demonstrate that a social robot equipped with suitable scaffolding mechanisms can increase engagement and learning, especially when being adaptive to the individual behavior and states of a child learner.},

In order to obtain effective representations, metric learning has become one of the most active researches in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. However, models using trained networks for predictions are often cumbersome and difficult to be deployed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel deep distillation metric learning (DDML) for online teaching in the procedure of learning the distance metric. Specifically, we employ model distillation to transfer the knowledge acquired by the larger model to the smaller model. Unlike the 2-step offline and mutual online manners, we propose to train a powerful teacher model, who transfer the knowledge to a lightweight and generalizable student model and iteratively improved by the feedback from the student model. We show that our method has achieved state-of-the-art results on CUB200-2011 and CARS196 while having advantages in computational efficiency.},

abstract = {In recent years, digital twin (DT) has been an efficient and reliable representation tool for Industry 4.0 in general and fault diagnosis and monitoring, especially in machinery consisting of several components working in tandem that introduce a large amount of data to be processed. Having a cloud-based and platform-independent system that can interpret Big Data in real-time and represent the processed information in a user-friendly manner offers the opportunity not only for improving fault diagnosis and troubleshooting automation, but also offering a better representation of data for operators, technicians and engineers. This not only decreases the repair costs by enabling constant components' state of health awareness, but also increases the efficacy of the apparatus by lowering the downtimes due to faults and issues.In this paper (WindTwin), we propose a real-time, interactive and dynamic 3-D neural-network model that provides important information of a small-scale wind turbine (WT) machinery setup including the state of health of different components (bearings, shafts) based on monitoring sensors (vibrations and temperature) and operations conditions (rotation speed). The system features real-time data processing of six sensors with eight channels including two single axis-accelerometer, one tri-axial accelerometer, one acoustics (microphone), one temperature and one light sensor (for rotational speed) with sampling data collection rate of 51.2 kHz achieved through an edge developed machine learning algorithm based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm using single hidden-layer feed forward neural network (SLFN) and gradient-based backpropagation (BP) training algorithm. The system also provides platform-independent (desktop and mobile companion app) user interfaces thanks to its cloud-based data processing integration. The prototype system proved to have on average 83.33 % accuracy for the vibration-based condition monitoring model across the three different rotation speed of 15Hz, 9Hz and 12Hz with 1 second latency for different fault conditions to be reflected on the DT counterpart.},

abstract = {Inductive reasoning is an important educational practice but can be difficult for teachers to support in the classroom due to the high level of preparation and classroom time needed to choose the teaching materials that challenge students' current views. Intelligent tutoring systems can potentially facilitate this work for teachers by supporting the automatic adaptation of examples based on a student model of the induction process. However, current models of inductive reasoning usually lack two main characteristics helpful to adaptive learning environments, individual differences of students and tracing of students' learning as they receive feedback. In this paper, we describe a model to predict and simulate inductive reasoning of students for a categorization task. Our approach uses a Bayesian model for describing the reasoning processes of students. This model allows us to predict students' choices in categorization questions by accounting for their feature biases. Using data gathered from 222 students categorizing three topics, we find that our model has a 75% accuracy, which is 10% greater than a baseline model. Our model is a contribution to learning analytics by enabling us to assign different bias profiles to individual students and tracking these profile changes over time through which we can gain a better understanding of students' learning processes. This model may be relevant for systematically analysing students' differences and evolution in inductive reasoning strategies while supporting the design of adaptive inductive learning environments.},

abstract = {We performed an ex situ Wizard of Oz study of young adults interacting with an idealized digital personal assistant to discuss daily scheduling concerns and stress levels. We further varied rates of "learning" and personalization with the system to test user preferences and changes in participants' linguistic and psychological interactions with an unadapted versus adapted user model, and to determine whether those changes were attributable to acclimatization with the system or to the modeling capabilities, seeking to address 3 research questions: What are the psycholinguistic characteristics of user interactions with a dialogue system designed to act as a scheduling assistant? How does a system's ability to learn about a user and maintain a user model affect these interactions? Are changes in interaction styles uniquely attributable to user modeling ability rather than simply user familiarity or acclimation with the system? We present a linguistic analysis of the results using summary measures generated by a widely used psycholinguistic text analysis tool. Some of the measures seem to present the slightly paradoxical effect of reduced user engagement when a conversational agent explicitly discloses information about its user model to the user. These results suggest that future studies should take care to consider the degree to which the user model is directly exposed to the user. That is, being overly forthcoming about what has been learned about a user may undermine attempts to tailor conversational agents to actively engage and relate to users.},

abstract = {Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is a widely used method for learning from graph-based data. However, it fails to use the unlabeled data to its full potential, thereby hindering its ability. Given some pseudo labels of the unlabeled data, the GCN can benefit from this extra supervision. Based on Knowledge Distillation and Ensemble Learning, lots of methods use a teacher-student architecture to make better use of the unlabeled data and then make a better prediction. However, these methods introduce unnecessary training costs and a high bias of student model if the teacher's predictions are unreliable. Besides, the final ensemble gains are limited due to limited diversity in the combined models. Therefore, we propose Reliable Data Distillation, a reliable data driven semi-supervised GCN training method. By defining the node reliability and edge reliability in a graph, we can make better use of high quality data and improve the graph representation learning. Furthermore, considering the data reliability and data importance, we propose a new ensemble learning method for GCN and a novel Self-Boosting SSL Framework to combine the above optimizations. Finally, our extensive evaluation of Reliable Data Distillation on real-world datasets shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on semi-supervised node classification tasks.},

abstract = {Lifelong Learning encompasses vast learning opportunities and MOOCs are a learning environment that can be up to the challenge if current modeling challenges are addressed. Studies have shown the importance of modeling the learner for a more personal and tailored learning experience in MOOC. Furthermore, Open Learner Models have proven their added value in facilitating learner's follow-up and course content personalization. However, while modeling the learner's knowledge is a common practice, modeling the learner's psychological state is a relegated concern within the community. This is despite the myriad of scientific evidence backing up the importance and repercussion of the learner's psychological state during and on the learning process.Flow is a psychological state characterized by total immersion in a task and a state of optimal performance. Programmers often refer to it as "being in the zone". It reliably correlates favorable learning metrics, such as motivation and engagement, among others. The aim of this paper is to propose a functional and technical architecture (comprising a Domain Model, a Flow Model, and an Open Learner Model for MOOC in a Lifelong Learning context) accounting for the learner's Flow state. This work is dedicated to MOOC designers/providers, pedagogical engineers, psychology, and education researchers who meet difficulties to incorporate and account for the Flow psychological state in a MOOC.},

To address these problems, we develop a Differentially Private Knowledge Distillation (DPKD) framework to enable on-device deep learning as well as preserve training data privacy. We modify the conventional Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) paradigm by compressing the knowledge acquired by the ensemble of teachers into a student model in a differentially private manner. The student model is then trained on both the labeled, public data and the distilled knowledge by adopting a mixed training algorithm. Extensive experiments on popular image datasets, as well as the real implementation on a mobile device show that DPKD can not only benefit from the distilled knowledge but also provide a strong differential privacy guarantee (ε=2$) with only marginal decreases in accuracy.},

abstract = {Teaching robotics is an attractive way of motivating students to learn computer science. However, it is also a challenging topic for students of all ages and only one teacher in a classroom is too little to support approximately 30 students at the same time. Therefore, intelligent tutoring systems might be a meaningful way to support students and teachers. In this paper we describe an approach to support computer science lessons in secondary schools by using a learner model. We are explaining how the three phases of our learner model (data collection - profile construction - profile application) can be implemented for teaching robotics by using different types of implicit and explicit data to generate feedback for the teacher concerning competencies and knowledge of the students on the one hand and by supporting collaboration and group formation amongst the students on the other hand. The model is derived from literature and supported by data from different studies.},

We present examples of systems for AI-driven automatic patient iso-centering before a computed tomography scan, deep learning-based image reconstruction, and creation of optimized and standardized visualizations, for example, automatic rib-unfolding. At the reading and reporting levels, AI focuses on the detection and characterization of abnormalities and on automatic measurements in images. We introduce multiple AI systems for the brain, heart, lung, prostate, and musculoskeletal disease. The third level is exemplified by the integrated nature of the clinical data in a patient-specific manner. The AI algorithms at this level focus on risk prediction and stratification, as opposed to merely detecting, measuring, and quantifying images. An AI-based approach for individualizing radiation dose in lung stereotactic body radiotherapy is discussed. The digital twin is presented as a concept of individualized computational modeling of human physiology. Finally, at the cohort and population analysis levels, the focus of AI shifts from clinical decision-making to operational decisions and process optimization.},

abstract = {Multimodal learning aims at utilizing information from a variety of data modalities to improve the generalization performance. One common approach is to seek the common information that is shared among different modalities for learning, whereas we can also fuse the supplementary information to leverage modality-specific information. Though the supplementary information is often desired, most existing multimodal approaches can only learn from samples with complete modalities, which wastes a considerable amount of data collected. Otherwise, model-based imputation needs to be used to complete the missing values and yet may introduce undesired noise, especially when the sample size is limited. In this paper, we proposed a framework based on knowledge distillation, utilizing the supplementary information from all modalities, and avoiding imputation and noise associated with it. Specifically, we first train models on each modality independently using all the available data. Then the trained models are used as teachers to teach the student model, which is trained with the samples having complete modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in extensive empirical studies on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets.},

abstract = {Molecular property prediction (e.g., energy) is an essential problem in chemistry and biology. Unfortunately, many supervised learning methods usually suffer from the problem of scarce labeled molecules in the chemical space, where such property labels are generally obtained by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation which is extremely computational costly. An effective solution is to incorporate the unlabeled molecules in a semi-supervised fashion. However, learning semi-supervised representation for large amounts of molecules is challenging, including the joint representation issue of both molecular essence and structure, the conflict between representation and property leaning. Here we propose a novel framework called Active Semi-supervised Graph Neural Network (ASGN) by incorporating both labeled and unlabeled molecules. Specifically, ASGN adopts a teacher-student framework. In the teacher model, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning method to learn general representation that jointly exploits information from molecular structure and molecular distribution. Then in the student model, we target at property prediction task to deal with the learning loss conflict. At last, we proposed a novel active learning strategy in terms of molecular diversities to select informative data during the whole framework learning. We conduct extensive experiments on several public datasets. Experimental results show the remarkable performance of our ASGN framework.},

Negative stress exposure influences mission success or the short- and long-term health conditions of deployed personnel. To quantify negative stress, we introduce a washable smart textile with integrated sensors. Analyzing the transmitted sensor values, medical advisors monitor up to 72 sensor values in parallel in case of an average group size of eight people. In order to aggregate the amount of data, we propose a stress level scale that includes stress trends. To predict individual stress levels based on sensor data, environmental quantities and the individual physiological fingerprint, we train different machine learning models. To evaluate such models, we implement a data acquisition environment to label data snapshots. Therefore, we do not need to collect in-field data and expose humans to negative stress. Moreover, we can mock sensor failures and rare, but relevant, sensor value combinations that are difficult to acquire in real-world scenarios. Our evaluation environment identifies Random Forest Regressor from a set of 25 models to perform best to predict individual stress levels. This model performs 23.19 times better than a zero rule classifier to distinguish among nine stress levels for mission goal health condition and 10.50 times better for mission goal mission success. Finally, we present our current RHM user interface design. It addresses issues such as information overload, avatar sympathy and unnecessary navigation paths.},

abstract = {With successful applications of deep feature learning algorithms, spoken language identification (LID) on long utterances obtains satisfactory performance. However, the performance on short utterances is drastically degraded even when the LID system is trained using short utterances. The main reason is due to the large variation of the representation on short utterances which results in high model confusion. To narrow the performance gap between long, and short utterances, we proposed a teacher-student representation learning framework based on a knowledge distillation method to improve LID performance on short utterances. In the proposed framework, in addition to training the student model on short utterances with their true labels, the internal representation from the output of a hidden layer of the student model is supervised with the representation corresponding to their longer utterances. By reducing the distance of internal representations between short, and long utterances, the student model can explore robust discriminative representations for short utterances, which is expected to reduce model confusion. We conducted experiments on our in-house LID dataset, and NIST LRE07 dataset, and showed the effectiveness of the proposed methods for short utterance LID tasks.},

abstract = {Recently, deep learning-based models have been widely studied for click-through rate (CTR) prediction and lead to improved prediction accuracy in many industrial applications. However, current research focuses primarily on building complex network architectures to better capture sophisticated feature interactions and dynamic user behaviors. The increased model complexity may slow down online inference and hinder its adoption in real-time applications. Instead, our work targets at a new model training strategy based on knowledge distillation (KD). KD is a teacher-student learning framework to transfer knowledge learned from a teacher model to a student model. The KD strategy not only allows us to simplify the student model as a vanilla DNN model but also achieves significant accuracy improvements over the state-of-the-art teacher models. The benefits thus motivate us to further explore the use of a powerful ensemble of teachers for more accurate student model training. We also propose some novel techniques to facilitate ensembled CTR prediction, including teacher gating and early stopping by distillation loss. We conduct comprehensive experiments against 12 existing models and across three industrial datasets. Both offline and online A/B testing results show the effectiveness of our KD-based training strategy.},

abstract = {Recent recommender systems have started to employ knowledge distillation, which is a model compression technique distilling knowledge from a cumbersome model (teacher) to a compact model (student), to reduce inference latency while maintaining performance. The state-of-the-art methods have only focused on making the student model to accurately imitate the predictions of the teacher model. They have a limitation in that the prediction results incompletely reveal the teacher's knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge distillation framework for recommender system, called DE-RRD, which enables the student model to learn from the latent knowledge encoded in the teacher model as well as from the teacher's predictions. Concretely, DE-RRD consists of two methods: 1) Distillation Experts (DE) that directly transfers the latent knowledge from the teacher model. DE exploits "experts" and a novel expert selection strategy for effectively distilling the vast teacher's knowledge to the student with limited capacity. 2) Relaxed Ranking Distillation (RRD) that transfers the knowledge revealed from the teacher's prediction with consideration of the relaxed ranking orders among items. Our extensive experiments show that DE-RRD outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors and achieves comparable or even better performance to that of the teacher model with faster inference time.},

In this paper, we formulate session search as a personalization task under the framework of learning to rank. Personalization approaches re-rank results to match a user model. Such user models are usually accumulated over time based on the user's browsing behaviour. We use a pre-computed and transparent set of user models based on concepts from the social science literature. Interaction data are used to map each session to these user models. Novel features are then estimated based on such models as well as sessions' interaction data. Extensive experiments on test collections from the TREC session track show statistically significant improvements over current session search algorithms.},

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been widely used for prototyping data centers. Evolving it to high-fidelity digital twin is desirable for the management and operations of large-scale data centers. Manually calibrating CFD model parameters to achieve twin-class fidelity by specially trained domain expert is tedious and labor-intensive. To reduce manual efforts, existing automatic calibration approaches developed for various computational models apply heuristics to search model configurations within an empirically defined parameter bound. However, in the context of CFD, each search step requires long-lasting CFD model's iterated solving, rendering these approaches impractical with increased model complexity. This paper presents Kalibre, a knowledge-based neural surrogate approach that performs CFD model calibration by iterating four key steps of i) training a neural surrogate model based on CFD-generated data, ii) finding the optimal parameters at the moment through neural surrogate retraining based on sensor-measured data, iii) configuring the found parameters back to the CFD model, and iv) validating the CFD model using sensor-measured data as the ground truth. Thus, the parameter search is offloaded to the neural surrogate which is ultra-faster than CFD model's iterated solving. To speed up the convergence of Kalibre, we integrate prior knowledge of the twinned data center's thermophysics into the neural surrogate design to improve its learning efficiency. With about five hours computation on a 32-core processor, Kalibre achieves mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.81°C and 0.75°C in calibrating two CFD models for two production data halls hosting thousands of servers each while requires fewer CFD solving processes than existing baseline approaches.},

abstract = {Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) is a promising technology for in-memory computing with high storage density, fast inference, and good compatibility with CMOS. However, the mapping of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) model on RRAM suffers from realistic device issues, especially the variation and quantization error, resulting in a significant reduction in inference accuracy. In this work, we first extract these statistical properties from 65 nm RRAM data on 300mm wafers. The RRAM data present 10--levels in quantization and 50% variance, resulting in an accuracy drop to 31.76% and 10.49% for MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Based on the experimental data, we propose a combination of machine learning algorithms and on-line adaptation to recover the accuracy with the minimum overhead. The recipe first applies Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer an ideal model into a student model with statistical variations and 10 levels. Furthermore, an on-line sparse adaptation (OSA) method is applied to the DNN model mapped on to the RRAM array. Using importance sampling, OSA adds a small SRAM array that is sparsely connected to the main RRAM array; only this SRAM array is updated to recover the accuracy. As demonstrated on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, a 7.86% area cost is sufficient to achieve baseline accuracy for the 65 nm RRAM devices.},

abstract = {In general, college students enrolled in computer science courses are provided some software design classes and exercises. In a cross-reviewing learning/exercise environment, however, beginners often cannot provide useful feedback and viewpoints to others. One of the reasons for this is that beginners are not confident in their understanding of the software design models. These learners should be encouraged by strengthening their understanding of the models. In this research, we propose a self-review supporting environment that provides learners with feedback generated by translating their Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams into natural language descriptions. This enables beginners to recognize discrepancies between what they would like to describe in their class diagrams and what they actually describe in their class diagrams by comparing them in natural language. We designed three types of templates to make learners aware of the discrepancies. Moreover, we performed an experiment to evaluate whether the feedback produced by translating a learner's model into natural language can support the learner to detect errors in the model themselves, and whether this feedback can support the learner to correct errors in the model themselves. The results of the experiment indicated that the subjects detected errors in their class diagrams with 89.2% accuracy and detected 47.3% of all errors in their diagrams. Furthermore, the subjects corrected the errors they correctly detected with 78.6% accuracy.},

abstract = {More than a hundred countries implement freedom of information laws. In the UK, the Freedom of Information Act 2000 [1] (FOIA) states that the government's documents must be made freely available, or opened, to the public. Moreover, all central UK government departments' documents that have a historic value must be transferred to the The National Archives (TNA) within twenty years of the document's creation. However, government documents can contain sensitive information, such as personal information or information that would likely damage international relations if it was opened. Therefore, all government documents that are to be publicly archived must be sensitivity reviewed to identify and redact the sensitive information. However, the lack of structure in digital document collections and the volume of digital documents that are to be sensitivity reviewed mean that the traditional manual sensitivity review process is not practical for digital sensitivity review.In this thesis, we argue that sensitivity classification can be deployed to assist government departments and human reviewers to sensitivity review born-digital government documents. However, classifying sensitive information is a complex task, since sensitivity is context-dependent and can require a human to judge on the likely effect of releasing the information into the public domain. Moreover, sensitivity is not necessarily topic-oriented, i.e., it is usually dependent on a combination of what is being said and about whom.Through a thorough empirical evaluation, we show that a text classification approach is effective for sensitivity classification and can be improved by identifying the vocabulary, syntactic and semantic document features that are reliable indicators of sensitive or nonsensitive text [2]. Furthermore, we propose to reduce the number of documents that have to be reviewed to learn an effective sensitivity classifier through an active learning strategy in which a sensitivity reviewer redacts any sensitive text in a document as they review it, to construct a representation of the sensitivities in a collection [3].With this in mind, we propose a novel framework for technology-assisted sensitivity review that can prioritise the most appropriate documents to be reviewed at specific stages of the sensitivity review process. Furthermore, our framework can provide the reviewers with useful information to assist them in making their reviewing decisions. We conduct two user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework for assisting with two distinct digital sensitivity review scenarios, or user models. Firstly, in the limited review user model, which addresses a scenario in which there are insufficient reviewing resources available to sensitivity review all of the documents in a collection, we show that our proposed framework can increase the number of documents that can be reviewed and released to the public with the available reviewing resources [4]. Secondly, in the exhaustive review user model, which addresses a scenario in which all of the documents in a collection will be manually sensitivity reviewed, we show that providing the reviewers with useful information about the documents that contain sensitive information can increase the reviewers' accuracy, reviewing speed and agreement [5].This is the first thesis to investigate automatically classifying FOIA sensitive information to assist digital sensitivity review. The central contributions are our proposed framework for technology-assisted sensitivity review and our sensitivity classification approaches. Our contributions are validated using a collection of government documents that are sensitivity reviewed by expert sensitivity reviewers to identify two FOIA sensitivities, namely international relations and personal information. Our results demonstrate that our proposed framework is a viable technology for assisting digital sensitivity review.Supervisors Prof. Iadh Ounis (University of Glasgow), Dr. Craig Macdonald (University of Glasgow)Available from: http://theses.gla.ac.uk/41076},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a great deal of research in developing end-to-end speech recognition models, which enable simplifying the traditional pipeline and achieving promising results. Despite their remarkable performance improvements, end-to-end models typically require expensive computational cost to show successful performance. To reduce this computational burden, knowledge distillation (KD), which is a popular model compression method, has been used to transfer knowledge from a deep and complex model (teacher) to a shallower and simpler model (student). Previous KD approaches have commonly designed the architecture of the student by reducing the width per layer or the number of layers of the teacher. This structural reduction scheme might limit the flexibility of model selection since the student model structure should be similar to that of the given teacher. To cope with this limitation, we propose a KD method for end-to-end speech recognition, namely TutorNet, that applies KD techniques across different types of neural networks at the hidden representation-level as well as the output-level. For concrete realizations, we firstly apply representation-level knowledge distillation (RKD) during the initialization step, and then apply the softmax-level knowledge distillation (SKD) combined with the original task learning. When the student is trained with RKD, we make use of frame weighting that points out the frames to which the teacher pays more attention. Through a number of experiments, it is verified that TutorNet not only distills the knowledge between networks with different topologies but also significantly contributes to improving the performance of the distilled student.},

abstract = {The Elo rating system has been recognised as an effective method for modelling students and items within adaptive educational systems. A common characteristic across Elo-based learner models is that they are not sensitive to the lag time between two consecutive interactions of a student within the system. Implicitly, this characteristic assumes that students do not learn or forget between two consecutive interactions. However, this assumption seems insufficient in the context of adaptive learning systems where students could have improved their mastery through practising outside of the system or that their mastery may be declined due to forgetting. In this paper, we extend the existing works on the use of rating systems for modelling learners in adaptive educational systems by proposing a new learner model called MV-Glicko that builds on the Glicko rating system. MV-Glicko is sensitive to the lag time between two consecutive interactions of a student within the system and models it as a parameter that captures the confidence of the system in the current inferred rating. We apply MV-Glicko on three public data sets and three data sets obtained from an adaptive learning system and provide evidence that MV-Glicko outperforms other conventional models in estimating students’ knowledge mastery.},

Personalization systems typically build a user model, aiming to characterize the user at hand, and then use this model to personalize the interaction. Personalization and user modeling, however, are often intrinsically at odds with each other (a fact some times referred to as the personalization paradox). In this paper, we take a closer look at this personalization paradox, and identify two ways in which it might manifest: feedback loops and moving targets. To illustrate these issues, we report results in the domain of personalized exergames (videogames for physical exercise), and describe our early steps to address some of the issues arisen by the personalization paradox.},

abstract = {Privacy-preserving deep learning computing becomes popular these days as it helps protect, for example, both user data and deep neural network (DNN) model parameters at the same time with cryptographic techniques. In particular, significant efforts have been made to leverage secure two-party computation schemes for preventing user/model data from disclosure during DNN inference. Nevertheless, the existing works require manual intervention while converting trained models into secure computation programs, which is not scalable to modern deep networks efficiently. In this work, we propose a compiler framework, TONIC, to do the conversion automatically with scalability. Given a pre-trained DNN model, TONIC converts it into one of two secure two-party computation languages, i.e., ObliVM and ABY. Based on tailored backends built on top of a DNN compiler, TVM, our case studies show that TONIC is able to automatically convert popular DNN models, such as CryptoNets and MobileNetV2, into the corresponding programs for secure computations.},

A critical research challenge for personalized educational agents is real-time student modeling. Most student models are designed for and trained on only a single task, which limits the variety, flexibility, and efficiency of student player model learning. In this paper we present a research project applying transfer learning methods to student player models over different educational tasks, studying the effects of an algorithmic "multi-task personalization" approach on the accuracy and data efficiency of student model learning. We describe a unified robotic game system for studying multi-task personalization over two different educational games, each emphasizing early language and literacy skills such as rhyming and spelling. We present a flexible Gaussian Process-based approach for rapidly learning student models from interactive play in each game, and a method for transferring each game's learned student model to the other via a novel instance-weighting protocol based on task similarity. We present results from a simulation-based investigation of the impact of multi-task personalization, establishing the core viability and benefits of transferrable student models and outlining new questions for future in-person research.},

abstract = {Input devices, such as buttons and sliders, are the foundation of any interface. The typical user-centered design workflow requires the developers and users to go through many iterations of design, implementation, and analysis. The procedure is inefficient, and human decisions highly bias the results. While computational methods are used to assist various design tasks, there has not been any holistic approach to automate the design of input components. My thesis proposed a series of Computational Input Design workflows: I envision a sample-efficient multi-objective optimization algorithm that cleverly selects design instances, which are instantly deployed on physical simulators. A meta-reinforcement learning user model then simulates the user behaviors when using the design instance upon the simulators. The new workflows derive Pareto-optimal designs with high efficiency and automation. I demonstrate designing a push-button via the proposed methods. The resulting designs outperform the known baselines. The Computational Input Design process can be generalized to other devices, such as joystick, touchscreen, mouse, controller, etc.},

abstract = {With the passage of the 2018 U.S. Farm Bill, Industrial Hemp production is moved from limited pilot programs to a regulated agriculture production system. However, Industrial Hemp Supply Chain (IHSC) faces critical challenges, including high complexity and variability, very limited production knowledge, and lack of data/information tracking. In this paper, we propose blockchain-enabled IHSC and develop a preliminary simulation-based digital twin for this distributed cyber-physical system (CPS) to support the process learning and risk management. Basically, we develop a two-layer blockchain with proof of authority smart contract, which can track the data and key information, improve the supply chain transparency, and leverage local authorities and state regulators to ensure the quality control verification. Then, we introduce a simulation-based digital twin for IHSC management, which can characterize the process spatial-temporal causal interdependencies and dynamic evolution to guide risk control and decision making. Our empirical study demonstrates the promising performance of proposed platform.},

abstract = {With the increasing popularity of Digital Twin, there is an opportunity to employ deep learning models in symbiotic simulation system. Symbiotic simulation can replicate multiple what-if simulation instances from its real-time reference simulation (base simulation) for short-term forecasting. Hence, it is a useful tool for just-in-time decision making process. Recent trends on symbiotic simulation studies emphasize on its combination with machine learning. Despite its success and usefulness, very few works focus on application of such a hybrid system in microscopic traffic simulation. Existing application of machine (deep) learning models in microscopic traffic simulation is confined to either predictive analysis or offline simulation-based prescriptive analysis. Thus, there is also lack of work on updating parameters of a deep learning model dynamically for real-time traffic simulation. This is necessary if the learning-based model is to be used as part of the base simulation so that "Just-in-time (JIT)" what-if simulation initialized from the model can make better short-term forecasts. This paper proposes a data-driven modelling and simulation framework to dynamically update parameters of Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) for JIT microscopic traffic simulation. Extensive experiments were carried out to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of more accurate short-term forecasting than other baseline models.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous mobile computing have enabled ride-hailing services to collect vast amounts of behavioral data of riders and drivers and optimize supply and demand matching in real time. While these mobility service providers have some degree of control over the market by assigning vehicles to requests, they need to deal with the uncertainty arising from self-interested driver behavior since workers are usually free to drive when they are not assigned tasks. If a driver’s behavior can be accurately replicated on the digital twin, more detailed and realistic counterfactual simulations will enable decision making to improve mobility services as well as to validate urban planning. In this work, we formulate the problem of passenger-vehicle matching in a sparsely connected graph and proposed an algorithm to derive an equilibrium policy in a multi-agent environment. Our framework combines value iteration methods to estimate the optimal policy given expected state visitation and policy propagation to compute multi-agent state visitation frequencies. Furthermore, we developed a method to learn the driver’s reward function transferable to an environment with significantly different dynamics from training data. We evaluated the robustness to changes in spatio-temporal supply-demand distributions and deterioration in data quality using a real-world taxi trajectory dataset; our approach significantly outperforms several baselines in terms of imitation accuracy. The computational time required to obtain an equilibrium policy shared by all vehicles does not depend on the number of agents, and even on the scale of real-world services, it takes only a few seconds on a single CPU.},

abstract = {One-shot automated essay scoring (AES) aims to assign scores to a set of essays written specific to a certain prompt, with only one manually scored essay per distinct score. Compared to the previous-studied prompt-specific AES which usually requires a large number of manually scored essays for model training (e.g., about 600 manually scored essays out of totally 1000 essays), one-shot AES can greatly reduce the workload of manual scoring. In this paper, we propose a Transductive Graph-based Ordinal Distillation (TGOD) framework to tackle the task of one-shot AES. Specifically, we design a transductive graph-based model as a teacher model to generate pseudo labels of unlabeled essays based on the one-shot labeled essays. Then, we distill the knowledge in the teacher model into a neural student model by learning from the high confidence pseudo labels. Different from the general knowledge distillation, we propose an ordinal-aware unimodal distillation which makes a unimodal distribution constraint on the output of student model, to tolerate the minor errors existed in pseudo labels. Experimental results on the public dataset ASAP show that TGOD can improve the performance of existing neural AES models under the one-shot AES setting and achieve an acceptable average QWK of 0.69.},

abstract = {Semi-supervised learning on graphs is an important problem in the machine learning area. In recent years, state-of-the-art classification methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown their superiority over traditional ones such as label propagation. However, the sophisticated architectures of these neural models will lead to a complex prediction mechanism, which could not make full use of valuable prior knowledge lying in the data, e.g., structurally correlated nodes tend to have the same class. In this paper, we propose a framework based on knowledge distillation to address the above issues. Our framework extracts the knowledge of an arbitrary learned GNN model (teacher model), and injects it into a well-designed student model. The student model is built with two simple prediction mechanisms, i.e., label propagation and feature transformation, which naturally preserves structure-based and feature-based prior knowledge, respectively. In specific, we design the student model as a trainable combination of parameterized label propagation and feature transformation modules. As a result, the learned student can benefit from both prior knowledge and the knowledge in GNN teachers for more effective predictions. Moreover, the learned student model has a more interpretable prediction process than GNNs. We conduct experiments on five public benchmark datasets and employ seven GNN models including GCN, GAT, APPNP, SAGE, SGC, GCNII and GLP as the teacher models. Experimental results show that the learned student model can consistently outperform its corresponding teacher model by on average. Code and data are available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/CPF},

abstract = {User modeling aims to capture the latent characteristics of users from their behaviors, and is widely applied in numerous applications. Usually, centralized user modeling suffers from the risk of privacy leakage. Instead, federated user modeling expects to provide a secure multi-client collaboration for user modeling through federated learning. Existing federated learning methods are mainly designed for consistent clients, which cannot be directly applied to practical scenarios, where different clients usually store inconsistent user data. Therefore, it is a crucial demand to design an appropriate federated solution that can better adapt to user modeling tasks, and however, meets following critical challenges: 1) Statistical heterogeneity. The distributions of user data in different clients are not always independently identically distributed which leads to personalized clients; 2) Privacy heterogeneity. User data contains both public and private information, which have different levels of privacy. It means we should balance different information to be shared and protected; 3) Model heterogeneity. The local user models trained with client records are heterogeneous which need flexible aggregation in the server. In this paper, we propose a novel client-server architecture framework, namely Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning (HPFL) to serve federated learning in user modeling with inconsistent clients. In the framework, we first define hierarchical information to finely partition the data with privacy heterogeneity. On this basis, the client trains a user model which contains different components designed for hierarchical information. Moreover, client processes a fine-grained personalized update strategy to update personalized user model for statistical heterogeneity. Correspondingly, the server completes a differentiated component aggregation strategy to flexibly aggregate heterogeneous user models in the case of privacy and model heterogeneity. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the HPFL framework.},

abstract = {Question Answering (QA) systems have been extensively studied in both academia and the research community due to their wide real-world applications. When building such industrial-scale QA applications, we are facing two prominent challenges, i.e., i) lacking a sufficient amount of training data to learn an accurate model and ii) requiring high inference speed for online model serving. There are generally two ways to mitigate the above-mentioned problems. One is to adopt transfer learning to leverage information from other domains; the other is to distill the “dark knowledge” from a large teacher model to small student models. The former usually employs parameter sharing mechanisms for knowledge transfer, but does not utilize the “dark knowledge” of pre-trained large models. The latter usually does not consider the cross-domain information from other domains. We argue that these two types of methods can be complementary to each other. Hence in this work, we provide a new perspective on the potential of the teacher-student paradigm facilitating cross-domain transfer learning, where the teacher and student tasks belong to heterogeneous domains, with the goal to improve the student model’s performance in the target domain. Our framework considers the “dark knowledge” learned from large teacher models and also leverages the adaptive hints to alleviate the domain differences between teacher and student models. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two text matching tasks for retrieval-based QA systems. Results show the proposed method has better performance than the competing methods including the existing state-of-the-art transfer learning methods. We have also deployed our method in an online production system and observed significant improvements compared to the existing approaches in terms of both accuracy and cross-domain robustness.},

Learner support requires transparent and intelligible capacity building tools to grasp the idea of such complex systems and develop integrated design and engineering skills. Tangible components can help as physical cognitive artifacts for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications being part of CPS. However, the intertwining of physical and digital elements requires a didactically grounded vocabulary and development concept to learn with tangible artifacts as mental representation. In this paper we introduce an integrated tangible design and engineering learning support system. It synchronizes physical IoT components with their DT representation, as composed by means of M5Stack (m5stack.com), UIFlow© (flow.m5stack.com) using Blockly for visual programming, and the diagrammatic D3j-editor (D3js.org) for editing DTs and monitoring/controlling CPS behavior. Learners can design and engineer a CPS either via tangible IoT (control) elements, or digitally. Prepared use cases from smart home management and home healthcare serve as teasers for actively engaging learners in CPS development tasks.},

However, this may not be practical in many real-world applications, and it incurs additional computational costs. To achieve better efficiency, we propose a decentralized framework: Multi-Agent Ensemble. The framework leverages edge computing to facilitate ensemble learning techniques by focusing on the balancing of access restrictions (small sub-dataset) and accuracy enhancement. Specifically, network edge nodes (learners) are utilized to model classifications and predictions in our framework. Data is then distributed to multiple base learners who exchange data via an interaction mechanism to achieve improved prediction. The proposed approach relies on a training model rather than conventional centralized learning. Findings from the experimental evaluations using 20 real-world datasets suggest that Multi-Agent Ensemble outperforms other ensemble approaches in terms of accuracy even though the base learners require fewer samples (i.e., significant reduction in computation costs).},

Achieving this for new buildings is feasible, but it may be difficult to transform existing buildings to ZEBs. Digital twins provide a promising approach to monitor existing buildings and further increase their energy efficiency. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical entity. It has several applications in product design, product cycle, and fault detection. This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines physics-based and machine learning methods to create a DT for the built environment. A case study for a digital twin of a single room is also discussed.

abstract = {An emerging recipe for achieving state-of-the-art effectiveness in neural document re-ranking involves utilizing large pre-trained language models - e.g., BERT - to evaluate all individual passages in the document and then aggregating the outputs by pooling or additional Transformer layers. A major drawback of this approach is high query latency due to the cost of evaluating every passage in the document with BERT. To make matters worse, this high inference cost and latency varies based on the length of the document, with longer documents requiring more time and computation. To address this challenge, we adopt an intra-document cascading strategy, which prunes passages of a candidate document using a less expensive model, called ESM, before running a scoring model that is more expensive and effective, called ETM. We found it best to train ESM (short for Efficient Student Model) via knowledge distillation from the ETM (short for Effective Teacher Model) e.g., BERT. This pruning allows us to only run the ETM model on a smaller set of passages whose size does not vary by document length. Our experiments on the MS MARCO and TREC Deep Learning Track benchmarks suggest that the proposed Intra-Document Cascaded Ranking Model (IDCM) leads to over 400% lower query latency by providing essentially the same effectiveness as the state-of-the-art BERT-based document ranking models.},

abstract = {The knowledge of a deep learning model may be transferred to a student model, leading to intellectual property infringement or vulnerability propagation. Detecting such knowledge reuse is nontrivial because the suspect models may not be white-box accessible and/or may serve different tasks. In this paper, we propose ModelDiff, a testing-based approach to deep learning model similarity comparison. Instead of directly comparing the weights, activations, or outputs of two models, we compare their behavioral patterns on the same set of test inputs. Specifically, the behavioral pattern of a model is represented as a decision distance vector (DDV), in which each element is the distance between the model's reactions to a pair of inputs. The knowledge similarity between two models is measured with the cosine similarity between their DDVs. To evaluate ModelDiff, we created a benchmark that contains 144 pairs of models that cover most popular model reuse methods, including transfer learning, model compression, and model stealing. Our method achieved 91.7% correctness on the benchmark, which demonstrates the effectiveness of using ModelDiff for model reuse detection. A study on mobile deep learning apps has shown the feasibility of ModelDiff on real-world models.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems (RS) have employed knowledge distillation which is a model compression technique training a compact student model with the knowledge transferred from a pre-trained large teacher model. Recent work has shown that transferring knowledge from the teacher's intermediate layer significantly improves the recommendation quality of the student. However, they transfer the knowledge of individual representation point-wise and thus have a limitation in that primary information of RS lies in the relations in the representation space. This paper proposes a new topology distillation approach that guides the student by transferring the topological structure built upon the relations in the teacher space. We first observe that simply making the student learn the whole topological structure is not always effective and even degrades the student's performance. We demonstrate that because the capacity of the student is highly limited compared to that of the teacher, learning the whole topological structure is daunting for the student. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Hierarchical Topology Distillation (HTD) which distills the topology hierarchically to cope with the large capacity gap.

abstract = {Cross-modal hashing (CMH) maps heterogeneous multiple modality data into compact binary code to achieve fast and flexible retrieval across different modalities, especially in large-scale retrieval. As the data don't need a lot of manual annotation, unsupervised cross-modal hashing has a wider application prospect than supervised method. However, the existing unsupervised methods are difficult to achieve satisfactory performance due to the lack of credible supervisory information. To solve this problem, inspired by knowledge distillation, we propose a novel unsupervised Knowledge Distillation Cross-Modal Hashing method (KDCMH), which can use similarity information distilled from unsupervised method to guide supervised method. Specifically, firstly, the teacher model adopted an unsupervised distribution-based similarity hashing method, which can construct a modal fusion similarity matrix.Secondly, under the supervision of teacher model distillation information, student model can generate more discriminative hash codes. In two public datasets NUS-WIDE and MIRFLICKR-25K, extensive experiments have proved the significant improvement of KDCMH on several representative unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods.},

abstract = {Breathing biomarkers, such as breathing rate, fractional inspiratory time, and inhalation-exhalation ratio, are vital for monitoring the user's health and well-being. Accurate estimation of such biomarkers requires breathing phase detection, i.e., inhalation and exhalation. However, traditional breathing phase monitoring relies on uncomfortable equipment, e.g., chestbands. Smartphone acoustic sensors have shown promising results for passive breathing monitoring during sleep or guided breathing. However, detecting breathing phases using acoustic data can be challenging for various reasons. One of the major obstacles is the complexity of annotating breathing sounds due to inaudible parts in regular breathing and background noises. This paper assesses the potential of using smartphone acoustic sensors for passive unguided breathing phase monitoring in a natural environment. We address the annotation challenges by developing a novel variant of the teacher-student training method for transferring knowledge from an inertial sensor to an acoustic sensor, eliminating the need for manual breathing sound annotation by fusing signal processing with deep learning techniques. We train and evaluate our model on the breathing data collected from 131 subjects, including healthy individuals and respiratory patients. Experimental results show that our model can detect breathing phases with 77.33% accuracy using acoustic sensors. We further present an example use-case of breathing phase-detection by first estimating the biomarkers from the estimated breathing phases and then using these biomarkers for pulmonary patient detection. Using the detected breathing phases, we can estimate fractional inspiratory time with 92.08% accuracy, the inhalation-exhalation ratio with 86.76% accuracy, and the breathing rate with 91.74% accuracy. Moreover, we can distinguish respiratory patients from healthy individuals with up to 76% accuracy. This paper is the first to show the feasibility of detecting regular breathing phases towards passively monitoring respiratory health and well-being using acoustic data captured by a smartphone.},

abstract = {Medical image segmentation task has been a hot research topic in the field of computer vision and natural field for many years. With the rapid development and application of convolutional neural networks, more and more medical segmentation models based on deep learning have been proposed, and more successful results and applications have been achieved in many disease segmentation tasks.The effect of medical image segmentation tasks is getting better. However, the computational cost of the medical image segmentation model has not been improved well. In this work, we propose a medical image segmentation model compression scheme that is theoretically applicable to all convolutional neural networks. First, we choose to construct a search space based on the number of convolution kernels at each location where convolution is used in the model, and then use neural network search to find a sub-network in this search space with less computation and high segmentation accuracy. Aiming at the encoding-decoding structure of the segmentation network, we propose Symmetrical-NAS to ensure that the encoding structure and decoding structure of any sub-network in our search space are symmetrical. Since it is too expensive to traverse the entire search space for training to find the most suitable architecture, we use weight sharing for training. During training, a sub-network in the search space is randomly selected for activation each time. Second, we use the method of knowledge distillation for training. We use the basic model as the teacher model and the searched sub-network as the student model to realize the knowledge transfer between the teacher model and the student model. Third, we use separable convolution instead of convolutional layer. Our method can be applied to various medicial image segmentation models regardless of model architectures and learning algorithms. Our method can reduce the computation of medical image segmentation models by 90\texttimes{} regarding FLOPs with little loss of segmentation effect. The code and demo will be publicly available.},

abstract = {3D reconstruction of stereo endoscope image, as an enabling technique for varied surgical systems, e.g., medical droids, navigations, etc., suffers from severe overfitting problems due to scarce labels. Semi-supervised learning based on Teacher-Student Network (TSN) is a potential solution, which utilizes a supervised teacher model trained on available labeled data to teach a student model on all images via assigning them pseudo labels. However, TSN often faces a dilemma: if given only few labeled endoscope images, the teacher model will be trained to be defective and induce high-noised pseudo labels, degrading the student model significantly. To solve this, we propose an improved TSN for a robust 3D reconstruction of stereo endoscope image. Specifically, two novel modules are introduced: 1) a semi-supervised teacher model based on adversarial learning to produce mostly correct pseudo labels by forcing a consistency in predictions for both labeled and unlabeled data, and 2) a confidence network to further filter out noisy pseudo labels by estimating a confidence for each prediction of the teacher model. By doing so, the student model is able to distill knowledge from more accurate and noiseless pseudo labels, thus achieving improved performance. Experimental results on two public datasets show that our improved TSN achieves a superior performance than the state-of-the-arts by reducing the averaged disparity error by at least 13.5%.},

Previous methods ignore explicit modeling of the global context relation among past and future actions, which is not an easy task due to the vacancy of unobserved videos. To solve this problem, we propose a Multimodal Global Relation Knowledge Distillation (MGRKD) framework to distill the knowledge learned from full videos to improve the action anticipation task on partially observed videos. The proposed MGRKD has a teacher-student learning strategy, where either the teacher or student model has three branches of global relation graph networks (GRGN) to explore the pairwise relations between past and future actions based on three kinds of features (i.e., RGB, motion or object). The teacher model has a similar architecture with the student model, except that the teacher model uses true feature of the future video snippet to build the graph in GRGN while the student model uses a progressive GRU to predict an initialized node feature of future snippet in GRGN. Through the teacher-student learning strategy, the discriminative features and relation knowledge of the past and future actions learned in the teacher model can be distilled to the student model. The experiments on two egocentric video datasets EPIC-Kitchens and EGTEA Gaze+ show that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performances.},

abstract = {Over the last few decades, artificial intelligence research has made tremendous strides, but it still heavily relies on fixed datasets in stationary environments. Continual learning is a growing field of research that examines how AI systems can learn sequentially from a continuous stream of linked data in the same way that biological systems do. Simultaneously, fake media such as deepfakes and synthetic face images have emerged as significant to current multimedia technologies. Recently, numerous method has been proposed which can detect deepfakes with high accuracy. However, they suffer significantly due to their reliance on fixed datasets in limited evaluation settings. Therefore, in this work, we apply continuous learning to neural networks' learning dynamics, emphasizing its potential to increase data efficiency significantly. We propose Continual Representation using Distillation (CoReD) method that employs the concept of Continual Learning (CL), Representation Learning (RL), and Knowledge Distillation (KD). We design CoReD to perform sequential domain adaptation tasks on new deepfake and GAN-generated synthetic face datasets, while effectively minimizing the catastrophic forgetting in a teacher-student model setting. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method is efficient at domain adaptation to detect low-quality deepfakes videos and GAN-generated images from several datasets, outperforming the-state-of-art baseline methods.},

abstract = {In mixed-initiative user interactions, a user and an autonomous agent collaborate for solving tasks by taking interleaving actions. However, this shift of control towards the agent requires a formation of trust for the user, otherwise the assistance possibly will be rejected and becomes obsolete. One approach for fostering a trustworthy interaction is to equip an agent with proactive dialogue capabilities. However, the development of adequate proactive dialogue strategies is complex and highly user- as well as context-dependent. Inappropriate usage of proactive conversation may even do more harm than good and corrupt the human-computer trust relationship. In order to alleviate this problem, modelling and predicting a proactive system’s perceived trustworthiness during an ongoing interaction is essential. Therefore, this paper presents novel work on the development of a user model for live prediction of trust during proactive interaction, incorporating user-, system-, and context-dependent features. For predicting trust, three machine-learning algorithms – support vector machine, eXtreme Gradient Boost, gated recurrent unit network – are trained and tested on a proactive dialogue corpus. The experimental results show that among the classifiers the support vector machine showed the most well-rounded performance, while the gated recurrent unit had the best accuracy. The results prove the developed user model to be reliable for predicting trust in proactive dialogue. Based on the outcomes, the usability of the proposed method in real-life scenarios is discussed and implications for developing user-adaptive proactive dialogue strategies are described.},

abstract = {Knowledge Distillation (KD), which transfers the knowledge of a well-trained large model (teacher) to a small model (student), has become an important area of research for practical deployment of recommender systems. Recently, Relaxed Ranking Distillation (RRD) has shown that distilling the ranking information in the recommendation list significantly improves the performance. However, the method still has limitations in that 1) it does not fully utilize the prediction errors of the student model, which makes the training not fully efficient, and 2) it only distills the user-side ranking information, which provides an insufficient view under the sparse implicit feedback. This paper presents Dual Correction strategy for Distillation (DCD), which transfers the ranking information from the teacher model to the student model in a more efficient manner. Most importantly, DCD uses the discrepancy between the teacher model and the student model predictions to decide which knowledge to be distilled. By doing so, DCD essentially provides the learning guidance tailored to "correcting" what the student model has failed to accurately predict. This process is applied for transferring the ranking information from the user-side as well as the item-side to address sparse implicit user feedback. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component.},

abstract = {Personalized search plays a crucial role in improving user search experience owing to its ability to build user profiles based on historical behaviors. Previous studies have made great progress in extracting personal signals from the query log and learning user representations. However, neural personalized search is extremely dependent on sufficient data to train the user model. Data sparsity is an inevitable challenge for existing methods to learn high-quality user representations. Moreover, the overemphasis on final ranking quality leads to rough data representations and impairs the generalizability of the model. To tackle these issues, we propose a Personalized Search framework with Self-supervised Learning (PSSL) to enhance data representations. Specifically, we adopt a contrastive sampling method to extract paired self-supervised information from sequences of user behaviors in query logs. Four auxiliary tasks are designed to pre-train the sentence encoder and the sequence encoder used in the ranking model. They are optimized by contrastive loss which aims to close the distance between similar user sequences, queries, and documents. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our proposed model PSSL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing baselines.},

Existing differentiable soft-body simulators can be classified into two categories based on their time integration methods: Simulators using explicit timestepping schemes require tiny timesteps to avoid numerical instabilities in gradient computation, and simulators using implicit time integration typically compute gradients by employing the adjoint method and solving the expensive linearized dynamics. Inspired by Projective Dynamics (PD), we present Differentiable Projective Dynamics (DiffPD), an efficient differentiable soft-body simulator based on PD with implicit time integration. The key idea in DiffPD is to speed up backpropagation by exploiting the prefactorized Cholesky decomposition in forward PD simulation. In terms of contact handling, DiffPD supports two types of contacts: a penalty-based model describing contact and friction forces and a complementarity-based model enforcing non-penetration conditions and static friction. We evaluate the performance of DiffPD and observe it is 4–19 times faster compared with the standard Newton’s method in various applications including system identification, inverse design problems, trajectory optimization, and closed-loop control. We also apply DiffPD in a reality-to-simulation (real-to-sim) example with contact and collisions and show its capability of reconstructing a digital twin of real-world scenes.},

abstract = {Dynamic graph representation learning strategies are based on different neural architectures to capture the graph evolution over time. However, the underlying neural architectures require a large amount of parameters to train and suffer from high online inference latency, that is several model parameters have to be updated when new data arrive online. In this study we propose Distill2Vec, a knowledge distillation strategy to train a compact model with a low number of trainable parameters, so as to reduce the latency of online inference and maintain the model accuracy high. We design a distillation loss function based on Kullback-Leibler divergence to transfer the acquired knowledge from a teacher model trained on offline data, to a small-size student model for online data. Our experiments with publicly available datasets show the superiority of our proposed model over several state-of-the-art approaches with relative gains up to 5% in the link prediction task. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our knowledge distillation strategy, in terms of number of required parameters, where Distill2Vec achieves a compression ratio up to 7:100 when compared with baseline approaches.

abstract = {Nuclei segmentation is an essential step in DNA ploidy analysis by image-based cytometry (DNA-ICM) which is widely used in cytopathology and allows an objective measurement of DNA content (ploidy). The routine fully supervised learning-based method requires often tedious and expensive pixel-wise labels. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised nuclei segmentation framework which exploits only sparsely annotated bounding boxes, without any segmentation labels. The key is to integrate the traditional image segmentation and self-training into fully supervised instance segmentation. We first leverage the traditional segmentation to generate coarse masks for each box-annotated nucleus to supervise the training of a teacher model, which is then responsible for both the refinement of these coarse masks and pseudo labels generation of unlabeled nuclei. These pseudo labels and refined masks along with the original manually annotated bounding boxes jointly supervise the training of student model. Both teacher and student share the same architecture and especially the student is initialized by the teacher. We have extensively evaluated our method with both our DNA-ICM dataset and public cytopathological dataset. Without bells and whistles, our method outperforms all existing weakly supervised entries on both datasets. Code and our DNA-ICM dataset are publicly available at &lt;uri&gt;https://github.com/CVIU-CSU/Weakly-Supervised-Nuclei-Segmentation&lt;/uri&gt;.},

abstract = {Modern businesses are being subjected to an unprecedented variety of change drivers that cannot be predicted such as new regulations, emerging business models, and changing needs of stakeholders. This creates new demands on enterprises to meet stated goals in a dynamic and uncertain environment that translate to demands on the enterprise’s software systems. Software systems however are currently designed to deliver a fixed set of goals and assumed to operate in a static environment, falling short in addressing the need for continuous adaptation under uncertainty. State-of-the-art adaptation architectures like MAPE-K have been applied to meeting non-functional requirements in a dynamic environment using a static repository of knowledge. This paper articulates the need for architecting software systems that learn from their own operation to dynamically extend existing knowledge, and utilize the knowledge to meet stated functional goals in an uncertain environment.},

abstract = {With rapid advancements in Cyber-Physical manufacturing, the Internet of Things, Simulation software, and Machine Learning algorithms, the applicability of Industry 4.0 is gaining momentum. The demand for real-time decision-making in the manufacturing industry has given significant attention to the field of Digital Twin (DT). The whole idea revolves around creating a digital counterpart of the physical system based on enterprise data to exploit the effects of numerous parameters and make informed decisions. Based on that, this paper proposes a simulation-optimization framework for the DT model of a Beverage Manufacturing Plant. A data-driven simulation model developed in Simio is integrated with Python to perform Multi-Objective optimization. The framework explores optimal solutions by simulating multiple scenarios by altering the availability of operators and dispatching/scheduling rules. The results show that simulation optimization can be integrated into the Digital-Twin models as part of real-time production planning and scheduling.},

abstract = {Due to lifestyle changes caused by COVID-19 and other factors, the importance of gaming platforms that allow users to play together with distant friends and family members is increasing. In general, it is difficult for users with widely different gaming skills to play together. Therefore, game designers need to take asymmetry into account, such as providing different roles and different operation interfaces for each user. In this study, we propose a foundation for an asymmetric tele-gaming platform using mobile robots and their digital twins. Then, we conducted an experiment to evaluate the usability of this platform. As a result, we found that the visual size of the digital twin may affect the usability. Based on these results, we propose a model of the relationship between the size of the digital twin and the usability perceived by the user.},

Despite many studies on digital twins, there is still a need for common architectures, platforms and information meta-modelling that enable defining various lifecycle data in a harmonized way, as well as integrating the information with machine learning and simulation models; a gap that is filled by this paper. Our approach for the integration of various digital twin models addresses three known technical debt in machine learning systems: data pipeline jungle, undeclared/unstable data dependencies and undeclared consumers.

abstract = {Digital twin technology and virtual augmented reality technology have been developed rapidly in recent years, and in order to make users get a good immersive experience, predicting user preferences and realizing integrated human-computer interaction are urgent problems. The application model of deep learning is a research hotspot in recent years, especially in some more complex pattern recognition problems, which has produced a large number of relevant research results, and the study of user preference strategy based on user line analysis, as a multidimensional data analysis task, is suitable for building multidimensional models to solve. Therefore, firstly, using the behavioral characteristics data of users in virtual reality, the Kmeans algorithm is used to categorize the scenes in virtual reality according to the obtained multidimensional data, and the data is enhanced to overcome the problem of unknown data characteristics and improve the robustness of the model. Again, according to the high-dimensional characteristics of users' behavioral characteristics, Improved BP neural network preference recommendation model was studied, and compared with the traditional clustering model for analysis. The experiments show that the model improves on the accuracy of user characteristics analysis in the virtual environment while ensuring the response time, and can effectively provide preference prediction to users, thus improving their immersive experience.},

In this paper, we propose a Consistency Mean Teaching (CMT) method to improve clustering-based UDA Re-ID. Our CMT consists of two consistencies, i.e., an inter-view consistency and an intra-identity consistency. First, the inter-view consistency exploits a popular self-supervised training for UDA, which has been neglected in existing clustering-based UDA methods. Second, the intra-identity consistency imposes regulations between the teacher and student model to output consistent representations for different samples from the same identity. Third, these two consistencies are integrated into a single student-teacher framework and facilitate complementary benefits. Experimental results show that CMT brings significant improvements over the baseline and achieves competitive accuracy on four popular UDA re-ID.},

abstract = {Neural end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) is superior to conventional statistical methods in many ways. However, the exposure bias problem, that arises from the mismatch between the training and inference process in autoregressive models, remains an issue. It often leads to performance degradation in face of out-of-domain test data. To address this problem, we study a novel decoding knowledge transfer strategy, and propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation (MT-KD) network for Tacotron2 TTS model. The idea is to pre-train two Tacotron2 TTS teacher models in teacher forcing and scheduled sampling modes, and transfer the pre-trained knowledge to a student model that performs free running decoding. We show that the MT-KD network provides an adequate platform for neural TTS training, where the student model learns to emulate the behaviors of the two teachers, at the same time, minimizing the mismatch between training and run-time inference. Experiments on both Chinese and English data show that MT-KD system consistently outperforms the competitive baselines in terms of naturalness, robustness and expressiveness for in-domain and out-of-domain test data. Furthermore, we show that knowledge distillation outperforms adversarial learning and data augmentation in addressing the exposure bias problem.},

We establish a conceptual layered architecture for a DT framework with decentralized implementation on cloud computing and enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) services for modeling and decision-making processes. The DT framework separates the control functions, deployed as a system of logically centralized process, from the physical devices under control, much like software-defined networking (SDN) in fifth generation (5G) wireless networks. To clarify the significance of DT in lowering the risk of development and deployment of innovative technologies on existing system, we discuss the application of implementing zero trust architecture (ZTA) as a necessary security framework in future data-driven communication networks.},

abstract = {Entity Matching (EM) is an important problem in data integration and cleaning. More recently, deep learning techniques, especially pre-trained language models, have been integrated into EM applications and achieved promising results. Unfortunately, the significant performance gain comes with the loss of explainability and transparency, deterring EM from the requirement of responsible data management. To address this issue, recent studies extended explainable AI techniques to explain black-box EM models. However, these solutions have the major drawbacks that (i) their explanations do not capture the unique semantics characteristics of the EM problem; and (ii) they fail to provide an objective method to quantitatively evaluate the provided explanations. In this paper, we propose Minun, a model-agnostic method to generate explanations for EM solutions. We utilize counterfactual examples generated from an EM customized search space as the explanations and develop two search algorithms to efficiently find such results. We also come up with a novel evaluation framework based on a student-teacher paradigm. The framework enables the evaluation of explanations of diverse formats by capturing the performance gain of a "student" model at simulating the target "teacher" model when explanations are given as side input. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on explaining state-of-the-art deep EM models on popular EM benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that Minun significantly outperforms popular explainable AI methods such as LIME and SHAP on both explanation quality and scalability.},

abstract = {Native ad is a popular type of online advertisement that has similar forms with the native content displayed on websites. Native ad click-through rate (CTR) prediction is useful for improving user experience and platform revenue. However, it is challenging due to the lack of explicit user intent, and user behaviors on the platform with native ads may be insufficient to infer users’ interest in ads. Fortunately, user behaviors exist on many online platforms that can provide complementary information for user-interest mining. Thus, leveraging multi-platform user behaviors is useful for native ad CTR prediction. However, user behaviors are highly privacy-sensitive, and the behavior data on different platforms cannot be directly aggregated due to user privacy concerns and data protection regulations. Existing CTR prediction methods usually require centralized storage of user behavior data for user modeling, which cannot be directly applied to the CTR prediction task with multi-platform user behaviors. In this article, we propose a federated native ad CTR prediction method named FedCTR, which can learn user-interest representations from cross-platform user behaviors in a privacy-preserving way. On each platform a local user model learns user embeddings from the local user behaviors on that platform. The local user embeddings from different platforms are uploaded to a server for aggregation, and the aggregated ones are sent to the ad platform for CTR prediction. Besides, we apply local differential privacy and differential privacy to the local and aggregated user embeddings, respectively, for better privacy protection. Moreover, we propose a federated framework for collaborative model training with distributed models and user behaviors. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset show that FedCTR can effectively leverage multi-platform user behaviors for native ad CTR prediction in a privacy-preserving manner.},

abstract = {Transfer learning is a popular software reuse technique in the deep learning community that enables developers to build custom models (students) based on sophisticated pretrained models (teachers). However, like vulnerability inheritance in traditional software reuse, some defects in the teacher model may also be inherited by students, such as well-known adversarial vulnerabilities and backdoors. Reducing such defects is challenging since the student is unaware of how the teacher is trained and/or attacked. In this paper, we propose ReMoS, a relevant model slicing technique to reduce defect inheritance during transfer learning while retaining useful knowledge from the teacher model. Specifically, ReMoS computes a model slice (a subset of model weights) that is relevant to the student task based on the neuron coverage information obtained by profiling the teacher model on the student task. Only the relevant slice is used to finetune the student model, while the irrelevant weights are retrained from scratch to minimize the risk of inheriting defects. Our experiments on seven DNN defects, four DNN models, and eight datasets demonstrate that ReMoS can reduce inherited defects effectively (by 63% to 86% for CV tasks and by 40% to 61% for NLP tasks) and efficiently with minimal sacrifice of accuracy (3% on average).},

In this paper, we propose a user model pre-training method named UserBERT to learn universal user models on unlabeled user behavior data with two contrastive self-supervision tasks. The first one is masked behavior prediction and discrimination, aiming to model the contexts of user behaviors. The second one is behavior sequence matching, aiming to capture user interest stable in different periods. Besides, we propose a medium-hard negative sampling framework to select informative negative samples for better contrastive pre-training.

In this paper, we propose a generic curriculum learning based optimization framework called CL-DRD that controls the difficulty level of training data produced by the re-ranking (teacher) model. CL-DRD iteratively optimizes the dense retrieval (student) model by increasing the difficulty of the knowledge distillation data made available to it. In more detail, we initially provide the student model coarse-grained preference pairs between documents in the teacher's ranking, and progressively move towards finer-grained pairwise document ordering requirements. In our experiments, we apply a simple implementation of the CL-DRD framework to enhance two state-of-the-art dense retrieval models. Experiments on three public passage retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been increasing interest in adopting published neural retrieval models learned from corpora for text retrieval. Although these models achieve excellent retrieval performance, in terms of popular accuracy metrics, on datasets they have been trained, their performance on new text data might degrade. To obtain the desired retrieval performance on both the data used in training and the latest data collected after training, the simple approach of learning a new model from both datasets is not always feasible since the annotated dataset used in training is often not published along with the learned model. Knowledge amalgamation (KA) is an emerging technique to deal with this problem of inaccessibility of data used in previous training. KA learns a new model (called a student model) from new data by reusing (called amalgamating) a number of trained models (called teacher models) instead of accessing the teachers' original training data. However, in order to efficiently learn an accurate student model, the classical KA approach requires manual selection of an appropriate subset of teacher models for amalgamation. This manual procedure for selecting teacher models prevents the classical KA from being scaled to retrieval tasks for which a large number of candidate teacher models are ready to be reused.This paper presents Arm, an intelligent system for efficiently learning a neural retrieval model with the desired accuracy on incoming data by automatically amalgamating a subset of teacher models (called a teacher model combination or simply combination ) among a large number of teacher models. o filter combinations that fail to produce accurate student models, Arm employs Bayesian optimization to derive an accuracy prediction model based on sampled amalgamation tasks. Then, Arm uses the derived prediction model to exclude unqualified combinations without training the rest combinations.To speed up training, Arm introduces a cost model that picks the teacher model combination with the minimal training cost among all qualified teacher model combinations to produce the final student model. This paper will demonstrate the major workflow of Arm and present the produced student models to users.},

abstract = {The student of this course should already know how to use 3D modeling software to create FBX files. This Course expands on a short overview presented in the Educators' Forum. It is different in several ways. First presented is the overview of the context and justification of why botanically accurate plants and landscapes are important for educational applications, such as for use in museums, arboretums, and field trip experiences to botanical gardens. Connected to that goal is the importance of accuracy in visualization of not only the plant, but the entire virtual model of the landscape using plant inventory data and plant population density geographical information system (GIS) data. This then touches on the important issues for digital twins, as models and simulations of reality. Educational applications are different than entertainment application in the dimensions of information fidelity, or the trustworthiness of the presentation, and also the graphical fidelity, or the photorealistic capacity of the rendering systems. These are not always the same. High graphical fidelity is a byproduct of high information fidelity; the reverse is not always true. High graphical fidelity enhances information fidelity, if used for that purpose. Two immersive informal learning applications use cases are presented, one for augmented reality (AR), and the other as a virtual reality (VR) example. Both models used the same design and development process, integrating domain expertise, the botanist and the ecologist, with the art and software team to enhance the accuracy. Co-design, highly iterative review process, removes errors in educational content, and representation, as well as usability and may be generalized to any domain when learning is a goal of a digital twin. In this work it is referred to as the Expert-Learner-User-Experience (ELUX) design process. Game engines, as general purpose visualization tools, make multimodal and interaction possible to enhance user experiences and to make semantic material accessible to the learner. The technical constrains on the application design demanded two production pipelines. The AR and VR pipeline required low-polygon models for performance, and the newly released Unreal Engine 5 and Reality Capture created an opportunity to increase the graphical fidelity and the information fidelity of the plants and models. Virtual nature construction methods are covered in two processes, first with low-polygon 3D plant models ideal for AR and VR, and the second with high-polygon 3D plant models using Unreal Engine 5 and Reality Capture. As highly accurate 3D plant models, combined with stat of the art rendering for photorealistic models, when combined with GIS geospatial datasets, and visualized in immersive devices, digital twins of the natural world become possible. Once these models are connected to mathematical models of the natural world, dynamics driven by real time data feeds, and forecasts, both back in time and forward into the future will enhance our understanding of the natural world, and how it interacts with that of the artificial man-made world.},

abstract = {Molecular biology prediction tasks suffer the limited labeled data problem since it normally demands a series of professional experiments to label the target molecule. Self-training is one of the semi-supervised learning paradigms that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data. It trains a teacher model on labeled data, and uses it to generate pseudo labels for unlabeled data. The labeled and pseudo-labeled data are then combined to train a student model. However, the pseudo labels generated from the teacher model are not sufficiently accurate. Thus, we propose a robust self-training strategy by exploring robust loss function to handle such noisy labels, which is model and task agnostic, and can be easily embedded with any prediction tasks. We have conducted molecular biology prediction tasks to gradually evaluate the performance of proposed robust self-training strategy. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently boosts the prediction performance, especially for molecular regression tasks, which have gained a 41.5% average improvement.},

abstract = {Recently, Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL) which aims at addressing the Few-Shot Learning (FSL) problem across different domains has attracted rising attention. The core challenge of CD-FSL lies in the domain gap between the source and novel target datasets. Though many attempts have been made for CD-FSL without any target data during model training, the huge domain gap makes it still hard for existing CD-FSL methods to achieve very satisfactory results. Alternatively, learning CD-FSL models with few labeled target domain data which is more realistic and promising is advocated in previous work. Thus, in this paper, we stick to this setting and technically contribute a novel Multi-Expert Domain Decompositional Network (ME-D2N). Concretely, to solve the data imbalance problem between the source data with sufficient examples and the auxiliary target data with limited examples, we build our model under the umbrella of multi-expert learning. Two teacher models which can be considered to be experts in their corresponding domain are first trained on the source and the auxiliary target sets, respectively. Then, the knowledge distillation technique is introduced to transfer the knowledge from two teachers to a unified student model. Taking a step further, to help our student model learn knowledge from different domain teachers simultaneously, we further present a novel domain decomposition module that learns to decompose the student model into two domain-related sub-parts. This is achieved by a novel domain-specific gate that learns to assign each filter to only one specific domain in a learnable way. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

abstract = {Current lane detection methods are struggling with the invisibility lane issue caused by heavy shadows, severe road mark degradation, and serious vehicle occlusion. As a result, discriminative lane features can be barely learned by the network despite elaborate designs due to the inherent invisibility of lanes in the wild. In this paper, we target at finding an enhanced feature space where the lane features are distinctive while maintaining a similar distribution of lanes in the wild. To achieve this, we propose a novel Repainting and Imitating Learning (RIL) framework containing a pair of teacher and student without any extra data or extra laborious labeling. Specifically, in the repainting step, an enhanced ideal virtual lane dataset is built in which only the lane regions are repainted while non-lane regions are kept unchanged, maintaining the similar distribution of lanes in the wild. The teacher model learns enhanced discriminative representation based on the virtual data and serves as the guidance for a student model to imitate. In the imitating learning step, through the scale-fusing distillation module, the student network is encouraged to generate features that mimic the teacher model both on the same scale and cross scales. Furthermore, the coupled adversarial module builds the bridge to connect not only teacher and student models but also virtual and real data, adjusting the imitating learning process dynamically. Note that our method introduces no extra time cost during inference and can be plug-and-play in various cutting-edge lane detection networks. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the RIL framework both on CULane and TuSimple for four modern lane detection methods. The code and model will be available soon.},

abstract = {Wearable sensor-based Human Action Recognition (HAR) has achieved remarkable success recently. However, the accuracy performance of wearable sensor-based HAR is still far behind the ones from the visual modalities-based system (i.e., RGB video, skeleton and depth). Diverse input modalities can provide complementary cues and thus improve the accuracy performance of HAR, but how to take advantage of multi-modal data on wearable sensor-based HAR has rarely been explored. Currently, wearable devices, i.e., smartwatches, can only capture limited kinds of non-visual modality data. This hinders the multi-modal HAR association as it is unable to simultaneously use both visual and non-visual modality data. Another major challenge lies in how to efficiently utilize multi-modal data on wearable devices with their limited computation resources. In this work, we propose a novel Progressive Skeleton-to-sensor Knowledge Distillation (PSKD) model which utilizes only time-series data, i.e., accelerometer data, from a smartwatch for solving the wearable sensor-based HAR problem. Specifically, we construct multiple teacher models using data from both teacher (human skeleton sequence) and student (time-series accelerometer data) modalities. In addition, we propose an effective progressive learning scheme to eliminate the performance gap between teacher and student models. We also designed a novel loss function called Adaptive-Confidence Semantic (ACS), to allow the student model to adaptively select either one of the teacher models or the ground-truth label it needs to mimic. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PSKD method, we conduct extensive experiments on Berkeley-MHAD, UTD-MHAD and MMAct datasets. The results confirm that the proposed PSKD method has competitive performance compared to the previous mono sensor-based HAR methods.},

abstract = {Modelling the user's multiple behaviors is an essential part of modern e-commerce, whose widely adopted application is to jointly optimize click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) predictions. Most of existing methods overlook the effect of two key characteristics of the user's behaviors: for each item list, (i) contextual dependence refers to that the user's behaviors on any item are not purely determinated by the item itself but also are influenced by the user's previous behaviors (e.g., clicks, purchases) on other items in the same sequence; (ii) multiple time scales means that users are likely to click frequently but purchase periodically. To this end, we develop a new multi-scale user behavior network named  &lt;u&gt;H&lt;/u&gt; ierarchical r &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt; current  &lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt; anking  &lt;u&gt;O&lt;/u&gt; n the  &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt; ntire  &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt; pace (HEROES) which incorporates the contextual information to estimate the user multiple behaviors in a multi-scale fashion. Concretely, we introduce a hierarchical framework, where the lower layer models the user's engagement behaviors while the upper layer estimates the user's satisfaction behaviors. The proposed architecture can automatically learn a suitable time scale for each layer to capture the dynamic user's behavioral patterns. Besides the architecture, we also introduce the Hawkes process to form a novel recurrent unit which can not only encode the items' features in the context but also formulate the excitation or discouragement from the user's previous behaviors. We further show that HEROES can be extended to build unbiased ranking systems through combinations with the survival analysis technique. Extensive experiments over three large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model compared with the state-of-the-art methods. characteristics of the user's behaviors: for each item list, (i) contex- tual dependence refers to that the user's behaviors on any item are not purely determinated by the item itself but also are influenced by the user's previous behaviors (e.g., clicks, purchases) on other items in the same sequence; (ii) multiple time scales means that users are likely to click frequently but purchase periodically.

abstract = {Wearable-based human activity recognition (HAR) is commonly employed in real-world scenarios such as health monitoring, auxiliary diagnosis, etc. As implementing activity recognition is a daunting challenge in an open dynamic environment, incremental learning has become a common method to adapt to variable behavior patterns of users and create dynamic modeling in activity recognition. However, catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge with incremental learning. This is contrary to our expectations of identifying new activity classes while remembering existing ones. To address this problem, we propose a knowledge importance-based class incremental learning method called KiCi and construct an incremental learning model based on the framework of self-iterative knowledge distillation for dynamic activity recognition. To eliminate the prediction bias of the teacher model on the old knowledge, we utilize the trained weights of previous incremental steps generated by the teacher model as the prior knowledge to obtain knowledge importance. Then use it to make the student model have a reasonable trade-off between old and new knowledge and mitigate catastrophic forgetting by avoiding negative transfer. We conduct extensive experiments on four public HAR datasets and our method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.},

abstract = {E-commerce marketplaces protect shopper experience and trust at scale by deploying deep learning models trained on human annotated moderation data, for the identification and removal of advert imagery that does not comply with moderation policies (a.k.a. defective images). However, human moderation labels can be hard to source for smaller advert programs that target specific device types with separate formats or for recently launched locales with unique moderation policies. Additionally, the sourced labels can be noisy due to annotator biases or policy rules clubbing multiple types of transgressions into a single category. Therefore, training advert image moderation models necessitates an approach that can effectively improve the sample efficiency of training, weed out noise and discover latent moderation sub-labels in one go.Our work demonstrates the merits of automated sub-label discovery using self-labelling. We show that self-labelling approaches can be used to decompose an image moderation task into its hidden sub-tasks (corresponding to intercepting a single sub-label) in an unsupervised manner, thus helping with cases where the granularity of labels is inadequate. This enables us to bootstrap useful representations quickly, via low-capacity but fast-learning teacher models that each specialize in a single distinct sub-task of the main classification task. These sub-task specialists then distil their logits to a high-capacity but slow-learning generalist student model, thus allowing it to perform well on complex moderation tasks with relatively fewer labels than vanilla supervised training. We conduct all our experiments on the moderation of sexually explicit advert images (though this method can be utilized for any defect type) and show a sizeable improvement in NPV (+30.2% absolute gain) viz-a-viz regular supervised baselines at a 1% FPR level. A long-term A/B test of our deployed model shows a significant relative reduction (-45.6%) in the prevalence of such advertisements compared to the previously deployed model.},

The KD adopts the teacher-student pair method to train model. Specifically, we use KD technology to compress the teacher model into student model, where only the student model is sent to the central server, which can efficiently reduce the communication overhead. Further, considering different network environments and vehicle heterogeneity, we design a model switching algorithm to improve communication efficiency.

abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been an increasing focus on data privacy, which is one of the most popular areas of research today. Due to legal restrictions, it is difficult to centralize data, so multi-party collaborative learning becomes difficult to achieve. In this paper, we propose a data collaborative analysis method for protecting data privacy: Knowledge Distillation-based Analysis (KDDA). The proposed method can effectively solve the above problems. The framework of the proposed method is based on "teacher-student" network. Specifically, each institution (e.g., hospital) used sensitive data to train local models, which we call teacher models. Then we introduce unlabeled public datasets. We design an aggregator that aggregates all teacher models to generate pseudo-labels for the public dataset. It is worth noting that to minimize the risk of data privacy exposure, we limit the number of generated pseudo-labels. Finally, we train the student model using semi-supervised learning on the public dataset with pseudo-labels. Since the student model is not directly trained on sensitive data, it will not lead to the leakage of data privacy, so it can be publicized. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on three popular image benchmark datasets: MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective.},

The gap between simulation and reality limits the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in UAV path planning. Therefore, we propose a digital twin-based deep reinforcement learning training framework. With the help of digital twin, DRL model can be trained more effectively deployed to real UAVs. In this training framework, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based multi-UAV path planning algorithm. Based on decomposed actor structure in DRL, we design a pooling-based combined LSTM network to better understand different state information in a multi-UAV path planning task. Moreover, we also establish a digital twin platform for multi-UAV system, which has a high degree of simulation and visualization. The simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher mean rewards, and outperforms DDPG in average arrival rate by more than 30%.},

We propose to use the concept of digital twins by combining results from Modelling &amp; Simulation, Artificial Intelligence, and Control Theory to create a risk free 'in silico' experimentation aid to help: (i) understand why a system is the way it is, (ii) be prepared for possible outlier conditions, and (iii) identify plausible solutions for mitigating the outlier conditions in an evidence-backed manner. We use reinforcement learning to systematically explore the digital twin solution space. Our proposal is significant because it advances the effective use of digital twins to new problem domains that have new potential for impact. Our approach contributes an original meta model for simulatable digital twin of industry scale techno-socioeconomic systems, agent-based implementation of the digital twin, and an architecture that serves as a risk-free experimentation aid to support simulation-based evidence-backed decision-making.

Moreover, I will describe the eyeglasses-based sensors that we currently develop and their perspectives for free-living monitoring. Moving on, in part two, I will discuss digital twin-based co-simulation as a novel system design approach for wearable devices and their relevance for supporting machine learning algorithm development. Finally, in part three, I will extend the scope into technology-based dietary intervention, i.e., how ADM can support users in their daily life when targeting a diet change or body weight reduction. I will show examples from our work to create digital twins that model individual behavior, identify behavior changes, and interaction strategies to integrate in everyday life.},

abstract = {Forward biomechanical simulation in HCI holds great promise as a tool for evaluation, design, and engineering of user interfaces. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has been used to simulate biomechanics in interaction, prior work has relied on unrealistic assumptions about the control problem involved, which limits the plausibility of emerging policies. These assumptions include direct torque actuation as opposed to muscle-based control; direct, privileged access to the external environment, instead of imperfect sensory observations; and lack of interaction with physical input devices. In this paper, we present a new approach for learning muscle-actuated control policies based on perceptual feedback in interaction tasks with physical input devices. This allows modelling of more realistic interaction tasks with cognitively plausible visuomotor control. We show that our simulated user model successfully learns a variety of tasks representing different interaction methods, and that the model exhibits characteristic movement regularities observed in studies of pointing. We provide an open-source implementation which can be extended with further biomechanical models, perception models, and interactive environments.},

abstract = {Symbiotic simulation systems that incorporate data-driven methods (such as machine/deep learning) are effective and efficient tools for just-in-time (JIT) operational decision making. With the growing interest on Digital Twin City, such systems are ideal for real-time microscopic traffic simulation. However, learning-based models are heavily biased towards the training data and could produce physically inconsistent outputs. In terms of microscopic traffic simulation, this could lead to unsafe driving behaviours causing vehicle collisions in the simulation. As for symbiotic simulation, this could severely affect the performance of real-time base simulation models resulting in inaccurate or unrealistic forecasts, which could, in turn, mislead JIT what-if analyses. To overcome this issue, a physics-guided data-driven modelling paradigm should be adopted so that the resulting model could capture both accurate and safe driving behaviours. However, very few works exist in the development of such a car-following model that can balance between simulation accuracy and physical consistency. Therefore, in this paper, a new “jointly-trained physics-guided Long Short-Term Memory (JTPG-LSTM)” neural network, is proposed and integrated to a dynamic data-driven simulation system to capture dynamic car-following behaviours. An extensive set of experiments was conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model from both modelling and simulation perspectives.},

abstract = {Machine learning models are often trained on sensitive data, such as medical records or bank transactions, posing high privacy risks. In fact, membership inference attacks can use the model parameters or predictions to determine whether a given data point was part of the training set. One of the most promising mitigations in literature is Knowledge Distillation (KD). This mitigation consists of first training a teacher model on the sensitive private dataset, and then transferring the teacher knowledge to a student model, by the mean of a surrogate dataset. The student model is then deployed in place of the teacher model. Unfortunately, KD on its own does not provide users much flexibility, meant as the possibility to arbitrarily decide how much utility to sacrifice to get membership-privacy. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that combines KD with confidence score masking. Concretely, we repeat the distillation procedure multiple times in series and, during each distillation, perturb the teacher predictions using confidence masking techniques. We show that our solution provides more flexibility than standard KD, as it allows users to tune the number of distillation rounds and the strength of the masking function. We implement our approach in a tool, RepKD, and assess our mitigation against white- and black-box attacks on multiple models and datasets. Even when the surrogate dataset is different from the private one (which we believe to be a more realistic setting than is commonly found in literature), our mitigation is able to make the black-box attack completely ineffective and significantly reduce the accuracy of the white-box attack at the cost of only 0.6% test accuracy loss.},

abstract = {Digital twins are increasingly developed to support the development, operation, and maintenance of cyber-physical systems such as industrial elevators. However, industrial elevators continuously evolve due to changes in physical installations, introducing new software features, updating existing ones, and making changes due to regulations (e.g., enforcing restricted elevator capacity due to COVID-19), etc. Thus, digital twin functionalities (often built on neural network-based models) need to evolve themselves constantly to be synchronized with the industrial elevators. Such an evolution is preferred to be automated, as manual evolution is time-consuming and error-prone. Moreover, collecting sufficient data to re-train neural network models of digital twins could be expensive or even infeasible. To this end, we propose unceRtaInty-aware tranSfer lEarning enriched Digital Twins LATTICE, a transfer learning based approach capable of transferring knowledge about the waiting time prediction capability of a digital twin of an industrial elevator across different scenarios. LATTICE also leverages uncertainty quantification to further improve its effectiveness. To evaluate LATTICE, we conducted experiments with 10 versions of an elevator dispatching software from Orona, Spain, which are deployed in a Software in the Loop (SiL) environment. Experiment results show that LATTICE, on average, improves the Mean Squared Error by 13.131% and the utilization of uncertainty quantification further improves it by 2.71%.},

There is a growing body of literature on DTs in various technology-related fields. A critical thread has emerged within this body, warning on the danger to forget that the digital part is always only a partial representation of real life, and that this partiality is always selective and biased for a specific purpose. It may thus serve some group of stakeholders better than others. We contribute with a literature review on the current understanding and use of the DT concept in the field of HCI. Our results consolidate the current understanding of DTs’ potential in HCI and note the omission of the critical perspective within the reviewed literature. The paper opens discussion of what HCI can bring to DT development and use.},

abstract = {Knowing "what is happening" and "what will happen" of the mobility in a city is the building block of a data-driven smart city system. In recent years, mobility digital twin that makes a virtual replication of human mobility and predicting or simulating the fine-grained movements of the subjects in a virtual space at a metropolitan scale in near real-time has shown its great potential in modern urban intelligent systems. However, few studies have provided practical solutions. The main difficulties are four-folds: 1) the daily variation of human mobility is hard to model and predict; 2) the transportation network enforces a complex constraints on human mobility; 3) generating a rational fine-grained human trajectory is challenging for existing machine learning models; and 4) making a fine-grained prediction incurs high computational costs, which is challenging for an online system. Bearing these difficulties in mind, in this paper we propose a two-stage human mobility predictor that stratifies the coarse and fine-grained level predictions. In the first stage, to encode the daily variation of human mobility at a metropolitan level, we automatically extract citywide mobility trends as crowd contexts and predict long-term and long-distance movements at a coarse level. In the second stage, the coarse predictions are resolved to a fine-grained level via a probabilistic trajectory retrieval method, which offloads most of the heavy computations to the offline phase. We tested our method using a real-world mobile phone GPS dataset in the Kanto area in Japan, and achieved good prediction accuracy and a time efficiency of about 2 min in predicting future 1h movements of about 220K mobile phone users on a single machine to support more higher-level analysis of mobility prediction.},

abstract = {App-based ride-hailing services, such as Uber and Lyft, have become popular thanks to technology advancements including smartphones and 4G/5G network. However, little is known about to what degree their operations impact urban traffic since Transportation Network Companies seldom share their ride data due to business and user privacy reasons. Recently, transportation engineering researchers began to collect data in large cities trying to understand the transportation impacts of ride-hailing services, so as to assist transport planning and policy making. However, (1) there does not exist a general data collection approach applicable to any city, and (2) the studies were based on historical data and cannot project the future easily even though ride-hailing services are developing quickly.In this paper, we introduce our approach to building a digital twin of the transportation in the medium-sized city of Birmingham, Alabama. This digital twin is a transportation simulation model that incorporates transportation modes such as public transits and ride-hailing services, in addition to private vehicles that constitute the majority of Birmingham's traffic. With this digital twin, transportation engineers can flexibly analyze the impact of ride-hailing services under different scenarios, such as "if the number of Uber drivers doubles" which could happen in the near future. The digital twin may also enable new opportunities, such as being an environment for learning policies with reinforcement learning.To enable realistic transportation simulation, we propose a novel approach to collect Uber ride data that is easy to carry out in any city. This approach collects app screenshots about Uber rides from Uber drivers, and uses crowdsourcing to postprocess these screenshots to extract detailed ride information. We then fit a spatiotemporal distribution of Uber rides using the collected data via network kernel density estimation (KDE). The existing network KDE method is flawed in that the contributions of different data samples are not the same, so we propose a new formulation to solve this issue. The distribution combined with population statistics from census data enable the generation of realistic Uber rides for agent-based simulation.

abstract = {The digital twin, as a digital counterpart of a physical entity, has shown great potential in data center prototyping and predictive thermal management. In this regard, Computational Fluid Dynamics/Heat Transfer (CFD/HT) models have been widely adopted. However, the computing time of the CFD/HT simulation is prohibitively long in practice. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) has been explored to approximate the CFD/HT simulation by a linear combination of POD modes and coefficients. Existing approaches to calculating the POD coefficients use either the black-box interpolation or the simplified physical model, leading to unsatisfactory generalization ability. To advance existing approaches, this paper proposes Reducio, a physics-guided model reduction approach based on the POD to predict the temperature field by following two key phases of i) offline POD modes calculation and coefficients interpolation and ii) online coefficients extrapolation supervised by the principle of energy balance. To extrapolate the coefficients with limited training data, we adopt the Gaussian Process (GP) model to learn a nonlinear map between the boundary conditions and POD coefficients. We conduct two case studies in two data centers with different scales. Evaluation results in the edge data center show that Reducio achieves sub-1°C mean absolute error (MAE) in temperature field prediction compared with the CFD/HT simulation result, outperforming the existing method based on the simplified physical model by 1.5 °C. When evaluating in the industry-grade hyper-scale data center with the sensor measurements, around 1°C temperature prediction MAE is observed. Furthermore, Reducio can predict the full-fledged temperature field in real-time, making it a strong candidate for building data center predictive digital twins.},

We investigate different management objectives that include end-to-end delay bounds on service requests, throughput objectives, and service differentiation. These objectives are mapped onto reward functions that an RL agent learns to optimize, by executing control actions, namely, request routing and request blocking. We compute the control policies not on the testbed, but in a simulator, which speeds up the learning process by orders of magnitude. In our approach, the system model is learned on the testbed; it is then used to instantiate the simulator, which produces near-optimal control policies for various management objectives. The learned policies are then evaluated on the testbed using unseen load patterns.},

abstract = {As a promising solution for model compression, knowledge distillation (KD) has been applied in recommender systems (RS) to reduce inference latency. Traditional solutions first train a full teacher model from the training data, and then transfer its knowledge (iesoft labels ) to supervise the learning of a compact student model. However, we find such a standard distillation paradigm would incur serious bias issue --- popular items are more heavily recommended after the distillation. This effect prevents the student model from making accurate and fair recommendations, decreasing the effectiveness of RS.In this work, we identify the origin of the bias in KD --- it roots in the biased soft labels from the teacher, and is further propagated and intensified during the distillation. To rectify this, we propose a new KD method with a stratified distillation strategy. It first partitions items into multiple groups according to their popularity, and then extracts the ranking knowledge within each group to supervise the learning of the student. Our method is simple and teacher-agnostic --- it works on distillation stage without affecting the training of the teacher model. We conduct extensive theoretical and empirical studies to validate the effectiveness of our proposal. We release our code at: https://github.com/chengang95/UnKD.},

However, the state-of-the-art unsupervised deep learning models for MTS anomaly detection are vulnerable to noise and have poor performance on the training data containing anomalies. In this article, we propose a novel Self-Training based Anomaly Detection with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model called STAD-GAN to address the practical challenge. The STAD-GAN model consists of a generator-discriminator structure for adversarial learning and a neural network classifier for anomaly classification. The generator is learned to capture the normal data distribution, and the discriminator is learned to amplify the reconstruction error of abnormal data for better recognition. The proposed model is optimized with a self-training teacher-student framework, where a teacher model generates reliable high-quality pseudo-labels to train a student model iteratively with a refined dataset so that the performance of the anomaly classifier can be gradually improved. Extensive experiments based on six open MTS datasets show that STAD-GAN is robust to noise and achieves significant performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Predicting the evolution of Covid19 pandemic has been a challenge as it is significantly influenced by the characteristics of people, places and localities, dominant virus strains, extent of vaccination, and adherence to pandemic control interventions. Traditional SEIR based analyses help to arrive at a coarse-grained 'lumped up' understanding of pandemic evolution which is found wanting to determine locality-specific measures of controlling the pandemic. We comprehend the problem space from system theory perspective to develop a fine-grained simulatable city digital-twin for "in-silico" experimentations to systematically explore - Which indicators influence infection spread to what extent? Which intervention to introduce, and when, to control the pandemic with some a-priori assurance? How best to return to a new normal without compromising individual health safety?

abstract = {Technological innovations are expanding rapidly in the public safety sector providing opportunities for more targeted and comprehensive urban crime deterrence and detection. Yet, the spatial dispersion of crimes may vary over time. Therefore, it is unclear whether and how sensors can optimally impact crime rates. We developed a Smart City Digital Twin-based method to dynamically place license plate reader (LPR) sensors and improve their detection and deterrence performance. Utilizing continuously updated crime records, the convolutional long short-term memory algorithm predicted areas crimes were most likely to occur. Then, a Monte Carlo traffic simulation simulated suspect vehicle movements to determine the most likely routes to flee crime scenes. Dynamic LPR placement predictions were made weekly, capturing the spatiotemporal variation in crimes and enhancing LPR performance relative to static placement. We tested the proposed method in Warner Robins, GA, and results support the method's promise in detecting and deterring crime.},

abstract = {The construction industry is struggling with low productivity rates because of a low level of digitalization, dynamic interactions, and uncontrollable circumstances on sites, which make the planning process complex. Usage of the digital twin construction paradigm enables to facilitate construction management and leverage the sector's unexploited potential. This research addresses current shortcomings by real-time discrete event simulation. During crane operations, kinematic data were collected, which were classified by machine learning algorithms for activity recognition and duration extraction. Based on the identified durations, Goodness-of-Fit techniques determined suitable probability density functions. The resulting probability density functions were used as input parameters in stochastic discrete event simulations. It was shown that with enriched data collection, probability density functions have to be updated. The data-driven discrete event simulation facilitates decision-making processes by providing more reliable real-time information for the planning of upcoming construction works. Thus, data-based instead of experience-based management can be enabled.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) is a prominent and growing area of machine learning that is rapidly changing how complex data in the world is modeled, interpreted, and utilized. To model these complexities, building accurate and robust DL models can often require heavy computation, memory, and energy costs. Because of this, researchers have been exploring methods to construct deep neural networks with small model sizes, light computation costs, and high segmentation accuracy. Knowledge distillation, a process in which a larger, cumbersome model is "distilled" into a smaller, student model, is a model compression method growing in popularity. In this research, we design efficient and compact deep networks using knowledge distillation to be applied to lane detection in autonomous vehicles with a low-cost computing environment in a classroom, such as Raspberry Pi. We address this by developing a student Convolutional Neural Network that reduces model size and minimizes accuracy loss as measured by the differences in MSE and R2 between the cumbersome model and the student model. Our research suggests that knowledge distillation can be applied to deep learning models trained for lane detection with improved model compactness and moderate accuracy preservation.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) systems are known for their susceptibility to cybersickness, which can seriously hinder users’ experience. Therefore, a plethora of recent research has proposed several automated methods based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to detect cybersickness. However, these detection methods are perceived as computationally intensive and black-box methods. Thus, those techniques are neither trustworthy nor practical for deploying on standalone VR head-mounted displays (HMDs). This work presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based framework VR-LENS for developing cybersickness detection ML models, explaining them, reducing their size, and deploying them in a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G processor-based Samsung A52 device. Specifically, we first develop a novel super learning-based ensemble ML model for cybersickness detection. Next, we employ a post-hoc explanation method, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Morris Sensitivity Analysis (MSA), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), and Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) to explain the expected results and identify the most dominant features. The super learner cybersickness model is then retrained using the identified dominant features. Our proposed method identified eye tracking, player position, and galvanic skin/heart rate response as the most dominant features for the integrated sensor, gameplay, and bio-physiological datasets. We also show that the proposed XAI-guided feature reduction significantly reduces the model training and inference time by 1.91X and 2.15X while maintaining baseline accuracy. For instance, using the integrated sensor dataset, our reduced super learner model outperforms the state-of-the-art works by classifying cybersickness into 4 classes (none, low, medium, and high) with an accuracy of and regressing (FMS 1–10) with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.03. Our proposed method can help researchers analyze, detect, and mitigate cybersickness in real time and deploy the super learner-based cybersickness detection model in standalone VR headsets.},

abstract = {Our time is characterized by big sprawling urban complexes that a majority of the human population chooses to live where interactions with the environment seem to be vanishing from our day to day lives. Our relationship with the planet’s natural ecosystem is paramount to our survival and well-being, a relationship that begins to form during our childhood years. Considering the above we propose a novel system which aims to give the ability to children to interact with the natural environment even when they have no access to it, from the classrooms in which they spend considerable parts of their lives. Specifically the proposed system is based on the technology of the Digital Twin, a core pillar of the 4th Industrial Revolution, and is comprised of a smart birdhouse and an electronic Digital Twin. The smart birdhouse can be deployed in a natural environment and collect atmospheric data like humidity and temperature values as well as record audio and pictures of possible bird visitors. At the same time the collected data will be available to the end user through a dashboard platform for atmospheric parameters and the digital electronic twin which will play the collected sound or pictures. With the above system we aim to achieve a greater and meaningful engagement of children with their natural habitat even when their urban environment makes it impractical or unfeasible.},

abstract = {The generation of large amounts of personal data provides data centers with sufficient resources to mine idiosyncrasy from private records. User modeling has long been a fundamental task with the goal of capturing the latent characteristics of users from their behaviors. However, centralized user modeling on collected data has raised concerns about the risk of data misuse and privacy leakage. As a result, federated user modeling has come into favor, since it expects to provide secure multi-client collaboration for user modeling through federated learning. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, existing federated learning methods that ignore the inconsistency among clients cannot be applied directly to practical user modeling scenarios, and moreover, they meet the following critical challenges: 1) Statistical heterogeneity. The distributions of user data in different clients are not always independently identically distributed (IID), which leads to unique clients with needful personalized information; 2) Privacy heterogeneity. User data contains both public and private information, which have different levels of privacy, indicating that we should balance different information shared and protected; 3) Model heterogeneity. The local user models trained with client records are heterogeneous, and thus require a flexible aggregation in the server; 4) Quality heterogeneity. Low-quality information from inconsistent clients poisons the reliability of user models and offsets the benefit from high-quality ones, meaning that we should augment the high-quality information during the process. To address the challenges, in this paper, we first propose a novel client-server architecture framework, namely Hierarchical Personalized Federated Learning (HPFL), with a primary goal of serving federated learning for user modeling in inconsistent clients. More specifically, the client train and deliver the local user model via the hierarchical components containing hierarchical information from privacy heterogeneity to join collaboration in federated learning. Moreover, the client updates the personalized user model with a fine-grained personalized update strategy for statistical heterogeneity. Correspondingly, the server flexibly aggregates hierarchical components from heterogeneous user models in the case of privacy and model heterogeneity with a differentiated component aggregation strategy. In order to augment high-quality information and generate high-quality user models, we expand HPFL to the Augmented-HPFL (AHPFL) framework by incorporating the augmented mechanisms, which filters out low-quality information such as noise, sparse information and redundant information. Specially, we construct two implementations of AHPFL, i.e., AHPFL-SVD and AHPFL-AE, where the augmented mechanisms follow SVD (singular value decomposition) and AE (autoencoder), respectively. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of both HPFL and AHPFL frameworks.},

abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) has been increasingly deployed in various real-world applications due to its unprecedented performance and automated capability of learning hidden representations. While DL can achieve high task performance, the training process of a DL model is both time- and resource-consuming. Therefore, current supply chains of the DL models assume the customers obtain pre-trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) from the third-party providers that have sufficient computing power. In the centralized setting, the model designer trains the DL model using the local dataset. However, the collected training data may contain erroneous or poisoned data points. The model designer might craft malicious training samples and inject a backdoor in the DL model distributed to the users. As a result, the user’s model will malfunction. In the federated learning setting, the cloud server aggregates local models trained on individual local datasets and updates the global model. In this scenario, the local client could poison the local training set and/or arbitrarily manipulate the local update. If the cloud server incorporates the malicious local gradients in model aggregation, the resulting global model will have degraded performance or backdoor behaviors. In this article, we present a comprehensive overview of contemporary data poisoning and model poisoning attacks against DL models in both centralized and federated learning scenarios. In addition, we review existing detection and defense techniques against various poisoning attacks.},

abstract = {Digital twin technology has revolutionized the state-of-the-art practice in many industries, and digital twins have a natural application to modeling cancer patients. By simulating patients at a more fundamental level than conventional machine learning models, digital twins can provide unique insights by predicting each patient's outcome trajectory. This has numerous associated benefits, including patient-specific clinical decision-making support and the potential for large-scale virtual clinical trials. Historically, it has not been feasible to use digital twin technology to model cancer patients because of the large number of variables that impact each patient's outcome trajectory, including genotypic, phenotypic, social, and environmental factors. However, the path to digital twins in radiation oncology is becoming possible due to recent progress, such as multiscale modeling techniques that estimate patient-specific cellular, molecular, and histological distributions, and modern cryptographic techniques that enable secure and efficient centralization of patient data across multiple institutions. With these and other future scientific advances, digital twins for radiation oncology will likely become feasible. This work discusses the likely generalized architecture of patient-specific digital twins and digital twin networks, as well as the benefits, existing barriers, and potential gateways to the application of digital twin technology in radiation oncology.},

abstract = {Recent recommender systems have shown remarkable performance by using an ensemble of heterogeneous models. However, it is exceedingly costly because it requires resources and inference latency proportional to the number of models, which remains the bottleneck for production. Our work aims to transfer the ensemble knowledge of heterogeneous teachers to a lightweight student model using knowledge distillation (KD), to reduce the huge inference costs while retaining high accuracy. Through an empirical study, we find that the efficacy of distillation severely drops when transferring knowledge from heterogeneous teachers. Nevertheless, we show that an important signal to ease the difficulty can be obtained from the teacher’s training trajectory. This paper proposes a new KD framework, named HetComp, that guides the student model by transferring easy-to-hard sequences of knowledge generated from the teachers’ trajectories. To provide guidance according to the student’s learning state, HetComp uses dynamic knowledge construction to provide progressively difficult ranking knowledge and adaptive knowledge transfer to gradually transfer finer-grained ranking information. Our comprehensive experiments show that HetComp significantly improves the distillation quality and the generalization of the student model.},

abstract = {Market sentiment analysis on social media content requires knowledge of both financial markets and social media jargon, which makes it a challenging task for human raters. The resulting lack of high-quality labeled data stands in the way of conventional supervised learning methods. In this work, we conduct a case study approaching this problem with semi-supervised learning using a large language model (LLM). We select Reddit as the target social media platform due to its broad coverage of topics and content types. Our pipeline first generates weak financial sentiment labels for Reddit posts with an LLM and then uses that data to train a small model that can be served in production. We find that prompting the LLM to produce Chain-of-Thought summaries and forcing it through several reasoning paths helps generate more stable and accurate labels, while training the student model using a regression loss further improves distillation quality. With only a handful of prompts, the final model performs on par with existing supervised models. Though production applications of our model are limited by ethical considerations, the model’s competitive performance points to the great potential of using LLMs for tasks that otherwise require skill-intensive annotation.},

Finally, a learning resource recommendation method is designed from the three dimensions of consolidation, promotion and expansion, and N resources with the highest degree of fit are recommended to learners. The experimental results show that GA-K-means algorithm is significantly better than the traditional K-means clustering algorithm in stability and effectiveness, and the classification of learner groups is also in line with the actual situation, which can recommend personalized learning resources that meet the cognitive level for students.},

However, existing methods have some bottlenecks: Firstly, the existing unsupervised methods suffer from inaccurate similarity measures due to the lack of correlation between features of different modalities and simple features cannot fully describe the fine-grained relationships of multi-modal data. Secondly, existing methods have rarely explored vision-language knowledge distillation schemes to distil multi-modal knowledge of these vision-language models to guide the learning of student networks. To address these bottlenecks, this paper proposes an effective unsupervised cross-modal hashing retrieval method, called Vision-Language Knowledge Distillation for Unsupervised Cross-Modal Hashing Retrieval (VLKD). VLKD uses the vision-language pre-training (VLP) model to encode features on multi-modal data, and then constructs a similarity matrix to provide soft similarity supervision for the student model. It distils the knowledge of the VLP model to the student model to gain an understanding of multi-modal knowledge. In addition, we designed an end-to-end unsupervised hashing learning model that incorporates a graph convolutional auxiliary network. The auxiliary network aggregates information from similar data nodes based on the similarity matrix distilled by the teacher model to generate more consistent hash codes. Finally, the teacher network does not require additional training, it only needs to guide the student network to learn high-quality hash representation, and VLKD is quite efficient in training and retrieval. Sufficient experiments on three multimedia retrieval benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves better retrieval performance compared to existing unsupervised cross-modal hashing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) is a task that learns semantic knowledge and embedding extraction to retrieve similar images using a sketch without any training examples of unseen classes. Existing methods have attempted to address the modal and semantic gaps in ZS-SBIR by using various strategies such as leveraging category linguistic information for improved discriminability and utilizing knowledge distillation to increase the model’s generalizability towards unseen classes. However, these methods fail to consider the importance of discriminability and generalizability in a unified manner. To address this, we propose a novel method called Adaptive Balanced Discriminability and Generalizability (ABDG) for ZS-SBIR. Specifically, our ABDG method utilizes an advanced two-stage knowledge distillation scheme to balance the learning of discriminability and generalizability for each instance. In addition to task-agnostic teacher models to preserve structural information used in existing work, we introduce a task-specific teacher model pre-trained with a classification objective function to emphasize the discriminability property during knowledge distillation. We also employ a novel entropy-based weighting strategy to balance the effects of structural information preservation and classification losses specific to the classification progress of each instance. Furthermore, we use fine-grained semantic relevance to refine the ego predictions of the student model, with the aim of improving its performance as the training objective continues to converge. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets of ZS-SBIR demonstrate that our ABDG method establishes a state-of-the-art performance by balancing the learning of discriminative and generalizable properties.},

abstract = {Knowledge Transfer has received much attention for its ability to transfer knowledge, rather than data, from one application task to another. In order to comply with the stringent data privacy regulations, privacy-preserving knowledge transfer is highly desirable. The Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) scheme is one promising approach to address this privacy concern while supporting knowledge transfer from an ensemble of "teacher" models to a "student" model under the coordination of an aggregator. To further protect the data privacy of the student node, the privacy-enhanced version of PATE makes use of cryptographic techniques at the expense of heavy computation overheads at the teacher nodes. However, this inevitably hinders the adoption of knowledge transfer due to the highly disparate computational capability of teachers. Besides, in real-life systems, participating teachers may drop out of the system at any time, which causes new security risks for adopted cryptographic building blocks. Thus, it is desirable to devise privacy-enhanced knowledge transfer that can run on teacher nodes with relatively fewer computational resources and can preserve privacy with dropped teacher nodes. In this connection, we propose a dropout-resilient and privacy-enhanced knowledge transfer scheme, Collaborative Split learning over Teacher Ensembles (CSTE), that supports the participating teacher nodes to train and infer their local models using split learning. CSTE not only allows the compute-intensive processing to be performed at a split learning server, but also protects the data privacy of teacher nodes from collusion between the student node and aggregator. Experimental results showed that CSTE achieves significant efficiency improvement from existing schemes.},

abstract = {Prediction models for click-through rate (CTR) learn feature interactions underlying user behaviors, which are crucial in recommendation systems. Due to their size and complexity, existing approaches have a limited range of applications. In order to decrease inference delay, knowledge distillation techniques have been used in recommendation systems. Due to the student model's lower capacity, the knowledge distillation process is less effective when there is a significant difference in the complexity of the network architecture between the teacher model and the student model.We present a novel knowledge distillation approach called Bridge-based Knowledge Distillation (BKD), which employs a bridge model to facilitate the student model's learning from the teacher model's latent representations. The bridge model is based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and leverages the edges of GNNs to identify significant feature interaction relationships, while simultaneously reducing redundancy for improved efficiency. To further enhance the efficiency of knowledge distillation, we decoupled the extracted knowledge and transferred each component separately to the student model, aiming to improve the distillation sufficiency of each module. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed BKD approach outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on various tasks.},

abstract = {Bundle recommendation aims to recommend a bundle of items to users as a whole with user-bundle (U-B) interaction information, and auxiliary user-item (U-I) interaction and bundle-item affiliation information. Recent methods usually use two graph neural networks (GNNs) to model user's bundle preferences separately from the U-B graph (bundle view) and U-I graph (item view). However, by conducting statistical analysis, we find that the auxiliary U-I information is far underexplored due to the following reasons: 1) Loosely combining the predicted results cannot well synthesize the knowledge from both views. 2) The local U-B and U-I collaborative relations might not be consistent, leading to GNN's inaccurate modeling of user's bundle preference from the U-I graph. 3) The U-I interactions are usually modeled equally while the significant ones corresponding to user's bundle preference are less emphasized.Based on these analyses, we propose a Distillation-enhanced Graph Masked AutoEncoder (DGMAE) for bundle recommendation. Our framework extracts the knowledge of first- and higher-order U-B relations from the U-B graph and injects it into a well-designed graph masked autoencoder (student model). The student model is built with two key designs to jointly capture significant local and global U-I relations from the U-I graph. In specific, we design a transformer-enhanced GNN encoder for global relation learning, which increases the model's representational power of depicting user's bundle preferences. Meanwhile, an adaptive edge masking strategy and reconstruction target are designed on the significant U-I edges to guide the student model to identify the potential ones suggesting user's bundle preferences. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the significant improvements of DGMAE over the SOTA methods.},

abstract = {Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based models have become the mainstream approach for recommender systems. Despite the effectiveness, they are still suffering from the cold-start problem, i.e., recommend for few-interaction items. Existing GNN-based recommendation models to address the cold-start problem mainly focus on utilizing auxiliary features of users and items, leaving the user-item interactions under-utilized. However, embeddings distributions of cold and warm items are still largely different, since cold items' embeddings are learned from lower-popularity interactions, while warm items' embeddings are from higher-popularity interactions. Thus, there is a seesaw phenomenon, where the recommendation performance for the cold and warm items cannot be improved simultaneously. To this end, we proposed a Uncertainty-aware Consistency learning framework for Cold-start item recommendation (shorten as UCC) solely based on user-item interactions. Under this framework, we train the teacher model (generator) and student model (recommender) with consistency learning, to ensure the cold items with additionally generated low-uncertainty interactions can have similar distribution with the warm items. Therefore, the proposed framework improves the recommendation of cold and warm items at the same time, without hurting any one of them. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both warm and cold items, with an average performance improvement of 27.6%.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is critical to ensure the security of cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, due to the increasing complexity of attacks and CPS themselves, anomaly detection in CPS is becoming more and more challenging. In our previous work, we proposed a digital twin-based anomaly detection method, called ATTAIN, which takes advantage of both historical and real-time data of CPS. However, such data vary significantly in terms of difficulty. Therefore, similar to human learning processes, deep learning models (e.g., ATTAIN) can benefit from an easy-to-difficult curriculum. To this end, in this paper, we present a novel approach, named digitaL twin-based Anomaly deTecTion wIth Curriculum lEarning (LATTICE), which extends ATTAIN by introducing curriculum learning to optimize its learning paradigm. LATTICE attributes each sample with a difficulty score, before being fed into a training scheduler. The training scheduler samples batches of training data based on these difficulty scores such that learning from easy to difficult data can be performed. To evaluate LATTICE, we use five publicly available datasets collected from five real-world CPS testbeds. We compare LATTICE with ATTAIN and two other state-of-the-art anomaly detectors. Evaluation results show that LATTICE outperforms the three baselines and ATTAIN by 0.906%-2.367% in terms of the F1 score. LATTICE also, on average, reduces the training time of ATTAIN by 4.2% on the five datasets and is on par with the baselines in terms of detection delay time.},

abstract = {Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm consisting of local model training, global model aggregation, and global model distribution. Recent research found that model aggregation can reveal the participants’ privacy. To preserve the participants’ privacy, multi-party computation-based secure aggregation is used in federated learning with mobile device participants. The character of the mobile device requires that secure aggregation can be efficient in computation and robust to the dropout. However, prior works need multi rounds, increase computation cost related to the dropped participants, and fails to resist quantum attacks. To solve these issues, we propose a 3-round post-quantum secure protocol for federated learning. In the proposed protocol, single-masking generated by homomorphic Pseudorandom Generator based on learning with round encrypts single user's model. After all the encrypted models are aggregated fast, additively homomorphic decryption based on Shamir secret share guarantee the robustness and performance induced by the dropped participants. All message exchange is based on a post-quantum secure channel constructed with the first post-quantum cryptography standard, Kyber KEM. In post-quantum security, security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can preserve privacy under the sem-honest adversaries setting, and the experimental results show higher running time efficiency.},

abstract = {Clinical trial digital twins are virtual patients that reflect personal characteristics in a high degree of granularity and can be used to simulate various patient outcomes under different conditions. With the growth of clinical trial databases captured by Electronic Data Capture (EDC) systems, there is a growing interest in using machine learning models to generate digital twins. This can benefit the drug development process by reducing the sample size required for participant recruitment, improving patient outcome predictive modeling, and mitigating privacy risks when sharing synthetic clinical trial data. However, prior research has mainly focused on generating Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs), which often assume large training data and do not account for personalized synthetic patient record generation. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient method TWIN for generating personalized clinical trial digital twins. TWIN can produce digital twins of patient-level clinical trial records with high fidelity to the targeting participant's record and preserves the temporal relations across visits and events. We compare our method with various baselines for generating real-world patient-level clinical trial data. The results show that TWIN generates synthetic trial data with high fidelity to facilitate patient outcome predictions in low-data scenarios and strong privacy protection against real patients from the trials.},

abstract = {News recommendation is essential for personalized news distribution. Federated news recommendation, which enables collaborative model learning from multiple clients without sharing their raw data, is a promising approach for preserving users' privacy. However, the security of federated news recommendation is still unclear. In this paper, we study this problem by proposing an untargeted attack on federated news recommendation called UA-FedRec. By exploiting the prior knowledge of news recommendation and federated learning, UA-FedRec can effectively degrade the model performance with a small percentage of malicious clients. First, the effectiveness of news recommendation highly depends on user modeling and news modeling. We design a news similarity perturbation method to make representations of similar news farther and those of dissimilar news closer to interrupt news modeling, and propose a user model perturbation method to make malicious user updates in opposite directions of benign updates to interrupt user modeling. Second, updates from different clients are typically aggregated with a weighted average based on their sample sizes. We propose a quantity perturbation method to enlarge sample sizes of malicious clients in a reasonable range to amplify the impact of malicious updates. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that UA-FedRec can effectively degrade the accuracy of existing federated news recommendation methods, even when defense is applied. Our study reveals a critical security issue in existing federated news recommendation systems and calls for research efforts to address the issue.

abstract = {Human Digital Twin (HDT) is a powerful tool to create a virtual replica of a human, to be used for example for designing interactions with physical systems, preventing cognitive overload, managing human capital, and maintaining a healthy and motivated workforce. Building human twins is a challenging task due to the need to reliably represent each corresponding human being, and the fact that human beings notably differ from each other. Therefore, relying solely on expert knowledge is insufficient, and human twins must learn the specifics of each individual in order to accurately represent them. This paper focuses on AI methods for modelling the mental wellbeing of knowledge workers because the mounting cognitive demands of both white-collar and blue-collar work lead to employees’ stress, and stress leads to diminished creativity and motivation, increased sick leaves, and in severe cases, accidents, burnouts, and disabilities. This paper describes the main building blocks of AI-based detectors of mental stress and highlights the main challenges and future directions of research., which are expected to be relevant also for HDT learning in other domains because the high degree of individuality is ubiquitous in all human activities.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) learns a global model in a distributional manner, which does not require local clients to share private data. Such merit has drawn lots of attention in the interaction scenarios, where Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) emerges as a cross-field research direction focusing on the robust training of agents. Different from FL, the heterogeneity problem in FRL is more challenging because the data depends on the policy of agents and the environment dynamics. FRL learns to interact under the non-stationary environment feedback, while the typical FL methods aim at handling the constant data heterogeneity. In this article, we are among the first attempts to analyze the heterogeneity problem in FRL and propose an off-policy FRL framework. Specifically, a student–teacher–student model learning and fusion method, termed as Server-Client Collaborative Distillation (SCCD), is introduced. Unlike the traditional FL, we distill all local models on the server side for model fusion. To reduce the variance of the training, a local distillation is also conducted every time the agent receives the global model. Experimentally, we compare SCCD with a range of straightforward combinations between FL methods and RL. The results demonstrate that SCCD has a superior performance in four classical continuous control tasks with non-IID environments.},

abstract = {While personalization increases the utility of recommender systems, it also brings the issue of filter bubbles. e.g., if the system keeps exposing and recommending the items that the user is interested in, it may also make the user feel bored and less satisfied. Existing work studies filter bubbles in static recommendation, where the effect of overexposure is hard to capture. In contrast, we believe it is more meaningful to study the issue in interactive recommendation and optimize long-term user satisfaction. Nevertheless, it is unrealistic to train the model online due to the high cost. As such, we have to leverage offline training data and disentangle the causal effect on user satisfaction. To achieve this goal, we propose a counterfactual interactive recommender system (CIRS) that augments offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with causal inference. The basic idea is to first learn a causal user model on historical data to capture the overexposure effect of items on user satisfaction. It then uses the learned causal user model to help the planning of the RL policy. To conduct evaluation offline, we innovatively create an authentic RL environment (KuaiEnv) based on a real-world fully observed user rating dataset. The experiments show the effectiveness of CIRS in bursting filter bubbles and achieving long-term success in interactive recommendation. The implementation of CIRS is available via https://github.com/chongminggao/ CIRS-codes.},

abstract = {This paper discusses comprehensively the advanced technologies used in the implementation of smart services, which are key elements of a smart city. Smart cities are becoming eco-friendly, livable, and sustainable to deliver essential services to their citizens by leveraging internet and communication technology advancements. Starting from a short literature review about smart cities and smart services, a recent trend in the technology used to implement smart services is collected. Smart service can be defined as a service conveyed using intelligent products that possess awareness and connectivity. All kinds of smart services can be connected in smart cities to offer citizens comprehensive solutions. Pre-emptive services, self-services, or highly interactive services, for example, have the potential to be implemented using current technology such as the internet of things, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, big data, machine learning, machine-to-machine communications, and the digital twin. Therefore, there is scope for research and implementation of other technology for smart services in the future.},

abstract = {In the present era of advanced technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling smart connected environments. This includes various domains such as smart homes, smart healthcare, smart cities, smart vehicles, and many others. The IoT facilitates the integration and interconnection of devices, enabling them to communicate, share data, and work together to create intelligent and efficient systems. With ubiquitous smart connected devices and systems, a large amount of data associated with them is at a prime risk from malicious entities (e.g., users, devices, applications) in these systems. Innovative technologies, including cloud computing, Machine Learning (ML), and data analytics, support the development of anomaly detection models for the Vehicular Internet of Things (V-IoT), which encompasses collaborative automatic driving and enhanced transportation systems. However, traditional centralized anomaly detection models fail to provide better services for connected vehicles due to issues such as high latency, privacy leakage, performance overhead, and model drift.Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant recognition for its ability to address data privacy concerns in the IoT domain. In the context of V-IoT, which involves autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems with connected vehicles communicating with various sensors and devices, FL is used to develop an anomaly detection model. Current technology, the Digital Twin (DT), proves beneficial in addressing uncertain crises and data security issues by creating a virtual replica that simulates various factors, including traffic trajectories, city policies, and vehicle utilization. This enables the system to facilitate efficient and inclusive decision-making. However, the effectiveness of a V-IoT DT system heavily relies on the collection of long-term and high-quality data to make appropriate decisions. Consequently, its advantages may be limited when confronted with urgent crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.This paper introduces a Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) based anomaly detection model for V-IoT, aiming to enhance the accuracy of the model. Our proposed model integrates both DT and HFL approaches to create a comprehensive system for detecting malicious activities using an anomaly detection model. Additionally, real-world V-IoT use case scenarios are presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed model.},

Subject-specific models of vessels allow the accurate prediction of pressure and flow, thus, enabling the study of individuals' responses to medical treatment. Instead of developing a model for a standard person, this paper features a design for the human circulatory system (HCS) accounting for the specific physiological parameters of an individual. We report using a reinforcement learning (RL) model for customary vessel parameters when training with subject-specific pressure and flow waveforms. We use an equivalent electric-circuit model for the human arteries and adjust the values of resistors, inductors, and capacitors in combination with reinforcement learning (RL). The conceived model stems as a digital twin replicating specific subjects. The reinforcement learning (RL) method predicts the vessel length and radius with an error of less than 10 % and fits pressure waveforms with a similarity higher than 94 %.},

This research aims to address such challenges and bridge the gaps between AAC stakeholders while exploring the potential of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered AAC systems to cater to diverse AAC needs and wants. To achieve these goals, we propose an imperfect surrogate user model for AAC system design and evaluation, develop a dedicated machine learning language model for AAC purposes, and design an AI-driven text entry system Tinkerable AAC (TAAC) which is ready for user testing. The objective of these efforts is to ultimately reduce the communication gap between AAC users and their speaking partners.},

abstract = {Knowledge distillation (KD) is a powerful and widely applicable technique for the compression of deep learning models. The main idea of knowledge distillation is to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a small student model, where the attention mechanism has been intensively explored in regard to its great flexibility for managing different teacher-student architectures. However, existing attention-based methods usually transfer similar attention knowledge from the intermediate layers of deep neural networks, leaving the hierarchical structure of deep representation learning poorly investigated for knowledge distillation. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical multi-attention transfer framework (HMAT), where different types of attention are utilized to transfer the knowledge at different levels of deep representation learning for knowledge distillation. Specifically, position-based and channel-based attention knowledge characterize the knowledge from low-level and high-level feature representations, respectively, and activation-based attention knowledge characterize the knowledge from both mid-level and high-level feature representations. Extensive experiments on three popular visual recognition tasks, image classification, image retrieval, and object detection, demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical multi-attention transfer or HMAT significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art KD methods.},

abstract = {Because of the ever-growing amount of wireless consumers, spectrum-sharing techniques have been increasingly common in the wireless ecosystem, with the main goal of avoiding harmful interference to coexisting communication systems. This is even more important when considering systems, such as nautical and aerial fleet radars, in which incumbent radios operate mission-critical communication links. To study, develop, and validate these solutions, adequate platforms, such as the Colosseum wireless network emulator, are key as they enable experimentation with spectrum-sharing heterogeneous radio technologies in controlled environments. In this work, we demonstrate how Colosseum can be used to twin commercial radio waveforms to evaluate the coexistence of such technologies in complex wireless propagation environments. To this aim, we create a high-fidelity spectrum-sharing scenario on Colosseum to evaluate the impact of twinned commercial radar waveforms on a cellular network operating in the CBRS band. Then, we leverage IQ samples collected on the testbed to train a machine learning agent that runs at the base station to detect the presence of incumbent radar transmissions and vacate the bandwidth to avoid causing them harmful interference. Our results show an average detection accuracy of 88%, with accuracy above 90% in SNR regimes above 0 dB and SINR regimes above --20 dB, and with an average detection time of 137 ms.},

abstract = {Nursing records, rich in free-text data, encapsulate valuable insights into patients' physiological status and physicians' diagnoses, offering more holistic perspectives than mere tabular data. The scrutiny of these free-text descriptions often enables physicians to rapidly assimilate the patients' historical and current health states, thereby facilitating accurate diagnosis and treatment. One particularly pressing issue is the identification of intra-dialytic hypotension (IDH) symptoms within these records. IDH, a sporadic yet potentially fatal complication during hemodialysis sessions for end-stage kidney disease patients, is diagnosed by a decrease of 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure during hemodialysis or a drop of 10 mmHg in mean arterial pressure coupled with hypo-perfusion-related symptoms. In response to this, we have meticulously developed a Multi-modality-aware IDH Classifier (MMIDHC) using a natural language processing (NLP) model aimed at the classification of these records. Primarily, this model focuses on the classification of English-Chinese bilingual dialysis records concerning IDH. Composed of three distinct modules, the model's intricate processes are delineated in Figure 1.Free-text Pre-processing: To investigate the influence of long sentences and noise on classification, we implemented sentence segmentation. Additionally, we enhanced the contextual relationships and augmented the sample size by merging adjacent segments in both antegrade and retrograde fashions, as context ordered-shuffling.Free-text Feature Extraction: To expedite the process and avoid the need to rebuild NLP models, we adopted publicly available NLP models that support the Chinese language for feature extraction. In this context, we utilized the Multilingual Universal Sentence Encoder (mUSE) proposed by Yang et al. [3] and the Multilingual Sentence BERT (mSBERT) introduced by Reimers et al. [2]. The latter model builds upon Sentence BERT (SBERT) [1] and incorporates the Teacher-Student Model. Both these multilingual NLP models serve as encoders, parsing free-text, and converting natural language into feature vectors. The performance of these models, in terms of metric indicators, showed minimal differences at a fixed threshold. Nevertheless, the mSBERT encoder consistently outperformed mUSE in speed, approximately 20 times faster. Given the potential impact of encoder speed on the operation of the multimodule model, we selected mSBERT as the primary encoder.Classification Learning: We employed a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for classifying the extracted features. In order to improve the reliability of our classification, we incorporated the MLP's Intradialytic Hypotension (IDH) results with the blood pressure readings from the ongoing dialysis session into an ensemble model. This method facilitates more nuanced decision-making. For example, if the MLP detects IDH symptoms (Yes), but the blood pressure reading is normal (False), we classify the result as False owing to lack of fulfilling definition of IDH. However, if both the MLP and the blood pressure readings suggest a normal state, we categorize the dialysis record as Non-IDH. Our baseline model has achieved encouraging results across all metrics: Accuracy 0.951, Recall 0.955, Precision 0.913, and F1-score 0.932.

The sustainable, resource-efficient operation of these buildings, such as schools and education centers, and the monitoring, control, and optimization of their climate, air, and energy performance pose multiple challenges, in particular to cope with the consequences of climate change and changes in the energy economy. In our approach, we consider buildings in which a network of heterogeneous sensors in each spatial unit records key properties such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration, as well as energy consumption and solar energy production. The continuously collected sensor data forms a spatio-temporal data space, which is used by the digital twin as a basis for AI-based analyses and simulations. The transfer of time-series data in near real time can be done by different databases. Analysis techniques focusing on time-series data allow for targeted access to the information and support the identification of exceptional events, recurring patterns, and the comparison of energy and climate-related performance. A prototype of an energy- and climate-oriented digital twin is currently being implemented in a government project in Andalusia, Spain, covering about 430 public buildings.},

Our key technical contribution is to demonstrate that using distilled prior knowledge of both sounds and objects in an unsupervised learning phase can improve performance significantly. We propose an Audio-Visual Correspondence (AVC) model consisting of an audio and a vision student, which are respectively supervised by an audio teacher (audio recognition model) and a vision teacher (object detection model). Leveraging a contrastive learning approach, the AVC student model extracts features from sounds and images and computes a localization map, discovering the regions of the visual data that correspond to the sound signal. Simultaneously, the teacher models provide feature-based hints from their last layers to supervise the AVC model in the training phase. In the test phase, the teachers are removed. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-visual localization models on 10k and 144k subsets of the Flickr and VGGS datasets, including cross-dataset validation.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of drug-drug interaction (DDI) is crucial to achieving effective decision-making in medical treatment for both doctors and patients. Recently, many deep learning based methods have been proposed to learn from drug-related features and conduct DDI prediction. These works have achieved promising results. However, the extreme imbalance of medical data poses a serious problem to DDI prediction, where a small fraction of DDI types occupy the majority training data. A straightforward way is to develop an appropriate policy to sample the data. Due to the high complexity and speciality of medical science, a dynamic learnable policy is required instead of a heuristic, uniform or static one. Therefore, we propose a REinforced Student-Teacher curriculum learning model (REST) for effective sampling to tackle this imbalance problem. Specifically, REST consists of two interactive parts, which are a heterogeneous graph neural network as the student and a reinforced sampler as the teacher. In each interaction, the teacher model takes action to sample an appropriate batch to train the student model according to the student model state while the cumulated improvement in performance of the student model is treated as the reward for policy gradient of the teacher model. The experimental results on two benchmarking datasets have demonstrated the significant effectiveness of our proposed model in DDI prediction, especially for the DDI types with low frequency.},

abstract = {Developing realistic and interactive virtual environments is a major hurdle in the progress of Metaverse. At present, majority of Metaverse applications necessitate the manual construction of 3D models which is both time-consuming and costly. Additionally, it is challenging to design environments that can promptly react to users' actions. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach to generate virtual worlds using digital twin (DT) technology and AI through a Text-to-Metaverse pipeline. This pipeline converts natural language input into a scene JSON, which is used to generate a 3D virtual world using two engines: Generative Script Engine (GSE) and Generative Metaverse Engine (GME). GME generates a design script from the JSON file, and then uses it to generate 3D objects in an environment. It aims to use multimodal AI and DT technology to produce realistic and highly detailed virtual environments. The proposed pipeline has potential applications including education, training, architecture, healthcare and entertainment, and could change the way designers and developers create virtual worlds. While this short paper covers an abstract as per the Doctorial Symposium's guidelines, it contributes to the research on generative models for multimodal data and provides a new direction for creating immersive virtual experiences.},

In this framework, the teacher model conducts multi-modal learning to achieve a comprehensive fusion of the optical flow, depth, and appearance features of human movements, thus achieving a more robust representation of actions. The student model is utilized to learn to recognize actions from the single RGB modality at a lower computational cost under the guidance of the teacher. To fully explore and integrate multi-modal information, a hierarchical Multi-modal Fusion Module (MFM) is introduced in the teacher model. Besides, a multi-level Distinguish-to-Mimic (D2M) knowledge distillation component is proposed for the student model. D2M improves the ability of the student model to mimic the action classification probabilities of the teacher model by enhancing the distinguishability of the student model for different video categories in the support set. Extensive experiments on three action recognition datasets Kinetics, HMDB51, and UCF101 demonstrate our framework's effectiveness and stable generalization ability. With a much more lightweight network for inference, we achieve comparable performance to previous state-of-the-art methods. Our source code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/Lite-MKD},

abstract = {Visual Question Answering (VQA) has achieved significant success over the last few years, while most studies focus on training a VQA model on a stationary domain (e.g., a given dataset). In real-world application scenarios, however, these methods are often inefficient because VQA systems are always supposed to extend their knowledge and meet the ever-changing demands of users. In this paper, we introduce a new and challenging multi-domain lifelong VQA task, dubbed MDL-VQA, which encourages the VQA model to continuously learn across multiple domains while mitigating the forgetting on previously-learned domains. Furthermore, we propose a novel replay-free Self-Critical Distillation (SCD) framework tailor-made for MDL-VQA, which alleviates forgetting issue via transferring previous-domain knowledge from teacher to student models. First, we propose to introspect the teacher's understanding over original and counterfactual samples, thereby creating informative instance-relevant and domain-relevant knowledge for logits-based distillation. Second, on the side of feature-based distillation, we propose to introspect the reasoning behavior of student model to establish the harmful domain-specific knowledge acquired in current domain, and further leverage the metric learning strategy to encourage student to learn useful knowledge in new domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCD framework outperforms state-of-the-art competitors with different training orders.},

abstract = {Multimodal recommendation exploits the rich multimodal information associated with users or items to enhance the representation learning for better performance. In these methods, end-to-end feature extractors (e.g., shallow/deep neural networks) are often adopted to tailor the generic multimodal features that are extracted from raw data by pre-trained models for recommendation. However, compact extractors, such as shallow neural networks, may find it challenging to extract effective information from complex and high-dimensional generic modality features. Conversely, DNN-based extractors may encounter the data sparsity problem in recommendation. To address this problem, we propose a novel model-agnostic approach called Semantic-guided Feature Distillation (SGFD), which employs a teacher-student framework to extract feature for multimodal recommendation. The teacher model first extracts rich modality features from the generic modality feature by considering both the semantic information of items and the complementary information of multiple modalities. SGFD then utilizes response-based and feature-based distillation loss to effectively transfer the knowledge encoded in the teacher model to the student model. To evaluate the effectiveness of our SGFD, we integrate SGFD into three backbone multimodal recommendation models. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate that SGFD-enhanced models can achieve substantial improvement over their counterparts.},

abstract = {Knowledge distillation is an effective paradigm for boosting the performance of pocket-size model, especially when multiple teacher models are available, the student would break the upper limit again. However, it is not economical to train diverse teacher models for the disposable distillation. In this paper, we introduce a new concept dubbed Avatars for distillation, which are the inference ensemble models derived from the teacher. Concretely, (1) For each iteration of distillation training, various Avatars are generated by a perturbation transformation. We validate that Avatars own higher upper limit of working capacity and teaching ability, aiding the student model in learning diverse and receptive knowledge perspectives from the teacher model. (2) During the distillation, we propose an uncertainty-aware factor from the variance of statistical differences between the vanilla teacher and Avatars, to adjust Avatars' contribution on knowledge transfer adaptively. Avatar Knowledge Distillation (AKD) is fundamentally different from existing methods and refines with the innovative view of unequal training. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our Avatars mechanism, which polishes up the state-of-the-art distillation methods for dense prediction without more extra computational cost. The AKD brings at most 0.7 AP gains on COCO 2017 for Object Detection and 1.83 mIoU gains on Cityscapes for Semantic Segmentation, respectively.},

abstract = {Pseudo-Labeling based semi-supervised learning has shown promising advantages in Scene Text Recognition (STR). Most of them usually use a pre-trained model to generate sequence-level pseudo labels for text images and then re-train the model. Recently, conducting Pseudo-Labeling in a teacher-student framework (a student model is supervised by the pseudo labels from a teacher model) has become increasingly popular, which trains in an end-to-end manner and yields outstanding performance in semi-supervised learning. However, applying this framework directly to Pseudo-Labeling STR exhibits unstable convergence, as generating pseudo labels at the coarse-grained sequence-level leads to inefficient utilization of unlabelled data. Furthermore, the inherent domain shift between labeled and unlabeled data results in low quality of derived pseudo labels. To mitigate the above issues, we propose a novel Cross-domain Pseudo-Labeling (CPL) approach for scene text recognition, which makes better utilization of unlabeled data at the character-level and provides more accurate pseudo labels. Specifically, our proposed Pseudo-Labeled Curriculum Learning dynamically adjusts the thresholds for different character classes according to the model's learning status. Moreover, an Adaptive Distribution Regularizer is employed to bridge the domain gap and improve the quality of pseudo labels. Extensive experiments show that CPL boosts those representative STR models to achieve state-of-the-art results on six challenging STR benchmarks. Besides, it can be effectively generalized to handwritten text.},

abstract = {Masked video modeling has shown remarkable performance in downstream tasks by predicting masked video tokens from visible ones. However, training models from scratch on large-scale unlabeled data remains computationally challenging and time-consuming. Moreover, the commonly used random-based sampling techniques may lead to the selection of redundant or low-information regions, hindering the model from learning discriminative representations within the limited training epochs. To achieve efficient pre-training, we propose MaskAgain, an efficient feature-based knowledge distillation framework for masked video pre-training that facilitates knowledge transfer from a pre-trained teacher model to a student model. In contrast to previous approaches that align all visible token features with the teacher model at output layers, MaskAgain adopts a selective approach by masking visible tokens again at both the hidden and output layers of the transformer block. Attention mechanisms are utilized for informative feature selection. At the hidden level, attention maps generated by the transformer's multi-head attention structure are utilized to select crucial token information at both temporally-global and temporally-local levels. Additionally, at the output level, an activation-based attention map is generated using token features, enabling us to focus on important tokens while preserving feature similarity and the relationship matrix similarity between patches. Extensive experimental results show that MaskAgain achieves comparable or even better performance than existing methods on benchmark datasets with much fewer training epochs and much less memory, which demonstrates that MaskAgain allows for efficient pre-training of accurate video models, reducing computational resources and training time significantly.

abstract = {Point clouds produced by 3D scanning are typically sparse, non-uniform, and noisy. Existing upsampling techniques directly learn the mapping from a sparse point set to a dense point set, which is often under-determined and ill-posed. To reduce the uncertainty and ambiguity of the upsampling mapping, this paper proposes a generic three-stage vector-quantization framework, which incorporates a Codebook lookup Transformer and knowledge distillation for Point Cloud Upsampling, named CPU. The proposed CPU reformulates the upsampling task into a relatively determinate code prediction task within a small, discrete proxy space. Since the traditional vector-quantization methods cannot be directly applied to point cloud upsampling scenarios, we introduce a knowledge distillation training scheme that facilitates efficient codebook learning and ensures full utilization of codebook entries. Specifically, we adopt a teacher-student training paradigm to avoid model collapse during codebook learning. In the first stage, we pre-train a vanilla auto-encoder of the dense point set as the teacher model, which provides rich guidance features to ensure sufficient codebook learning. In the second stage, we train a vector-quantized auto-encoder as a student model to capture high-fidelity geometric priors into a learned codebook with the aid of distillation. In the third stage, we propose a Codebook Lookup Transformer to model the global context of the sparse point set and predict the code indices. Then the coarse features of the sparse point set can be quantized and substituted by looking up the indices in the learned codebook. Benefiting from the expressive codebook priors and the distillation training scheme, the proposed CPU outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.},

abstract = {We introduce an end-to-end interactive system for mental face reconstruction – the challenging task of visually reconstructing a face image a person only has in their mind. In contrast to existing methods that suffer from low usability and high mental load, our approach only requires the user to rank images over multiple iterations according to the perceived similarity with their mental image. Based on these rankings, our mental face reconstruction system extracts image features in each iteration, combines them into a joint feature vector, and then uses a generative model to visually reconstruct the mental image. To avoid the need for collecting large amounts of human training data, we further propose a computational user model that can simulate human ranking behaviour using data from an online crowd-sourcing study (N=215). Results from a 12-participant user study show that our method can reconstruct mental images that are visually similar to existing approaches but has significantly higher usability, lower perceived workload, and is faster. In addition, results from a third 22-participant lineup study in which we validated our reconstructions on a face ranking task show a identification rate of , which is in line with prior work. These results represent an important step towards new interactive intelligent systems that can robustly and effortlessly reconstruct a user’s mental image.},

We scale up the fault diagnosis algorithm to the required real-time performance through the use of parallelization and surrogate models of the physics-based digital twin. The prognostics module tracks fault progression and trains the online degradation models to compute remaining useful life of system components. In addition, we use the degradation models to assess the impact of the fault progression on the operational requirements. The reconfiguration module uses PDDL-based planning endowed with semantic attachments to adjust the system controls to minimize the fault impact on the system operation. We define a resilience metric and use a fuel system example to demonstrate how the metric improves with our framework.},

abstract = {Microservices are terraforming the computing landscape with web-scale infrastructures (e.g., Facebook, Google, Amazon) and telecom infrastructures (e.g., ATT, Ericsson) adopting them. At it’s core, the microservices paradigm promotes a decoupling of applications into multiple services – a decoupling that promotes better scalability, fault-tolerance, and deployability. Unfortunately, this decoupling significantly increases the space of configuration options and performance problems, rendering traditional approaches to management ineffective. Recent efforts to address this problem embrace Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps). However, training effective AI models requires significant amounts of data and, in some instances, a framework for quickly exploring or analyzing model performance. Digital twins, or simulators, have effectively enabled AI-based management frameworks within other domains (e.g., manufacturing, industrial and automotive). In this paper, we propose the design of KubeKlone, the first comprehensive and opensource digital twin for modeling cloud-native microservices applications. KubeKlone is motivated by our need for accurate, efficient, and general model training. KubeKlone satisfies these goals by decoupling the simulation of microservices from the training of machine learning (ML) models while simultaneously ensuring efficiency and simplifying model design. In particular, KubeKlone introduces a queue-based simulator that abstracts infrastructure details and focuses on modeling, with queues, resource contentions across host and network components. To simplify model design, KubeKlone provides interfaces that hide simulator details and provides wrappers around popular ML packages. To illustrate the strengths of KubeKlone, we validate it against a deployment on Google Cloud Engine and implement several AIOps resource management algorithms (including PARTIES).},

However, it is still difficult to construct a relationship between twin simulation and a real scenario considering dynamic variations, especially when dealing with small surface defect detection tasks with high performance and computation resource requirements. In this article, we aim to construct cyber-manufacturing systems to achieve a DT solution for small surface defect detection task. Focusing on DT-based solution, the proposed system consists of an Edge–Cloud architecture and a surface defect detection algorithm. Considering dynamic characteristics and real-time response requirement, Edge–Cloud architecture is built to achieve smart manufacturing by efficiently collecting, processing, analyzing, and storing data produced by factory. A deep learning–based algorithm is then constructed to detect surface defeats based on multi-modal data, i.e., imaging and depth data. Experiments show the proposed algorithm could achieve high accuracy and recall in small defeat detection task, thus constructing DT in cyber-manufacturing.},

abstract = {The Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) collects information on cancer patients by receiving cancer messages from different medical entities (e.g., medical labs, hospitals) in Norway. Such messages are validated by an automated cancer registry system: GURI. Its correct operation is crucial since it lays the foundation for cancer research and provides critical cancer-related statistics to its stakeholders. Constructing a cyber-cyber digital twin (CCDT) for GURI can facilitate various experiments and advanced analyses of the operational state of GURI without requiring intensive interactions with the real system. However, GURI constantly evolves due to novel medical diagnostics and treatment, technological advances, etc. Accordingly, CCDT should evolve as well to synchronize with GURI. A key challenge of achieving such synchronization is that evolving CCDT needs abundant data labelled by the new GURI. To tackle this challenge, we propose EvoCLINICAL, which considers the CCDT developed for the previous version of GURI as the pretrained model and fine-tunes it with the dataset labelled by querying a new GURI version. EvoCLINICAL employs a genetic algorithm to select an optimal subset of cancer messages from a candidate dataset and query GURI with it. We evaluate EvoCLINICAL on three evolution processes. The precision, recall, and F1 score are all greater than 91%, demonstrating the effectiveness of EvoCLINICAL. Furthermore, we replace the active learning part of EvoCLINICAL with random selection to study the contribution of transfer learning to the overall performance of EvoCLINICAL. Results show that employing active learning in EvoCLINICAL increases its performances consistently.},

Therefore, this research focuses on the design of an AI-augmented digital twin towards adaptive serious-games therapy for people with disabilities (e.g., cerebral palsy, speech disorders, Parkinson’s disease) to provide solutions toward positive therapy results. Finding an adequate digital twin for therapy with people with disabilities is relevant, aiming at prediction and simulation in the context of using serious games for therapy engagement.},

abstract = {In this article, we suggest a way how to quantify the sensitivity of a data model w.r.t. training data at a certain input by using a derived model having a single data point as artificial parameter, and we relate our definition of sensitivity w.r.t. training data to the complexity of a data model. In case of linear regression and ridge regression we give an explicit expression for the so defined sensitivity w.r.t. training data and study the properties. Moreover, we discuss the numerical approximation of sensitivity w.r.t. training data for neural networks and provide an application of this numerical approximation to remote sensing in the environmental sciences.},

abstract = {Recommender systems are expected to be assistants that help human users find relevant information automatically without explicit queries. As recommender systems evolve, increasingly sophisticated learning techniques are applied and have achieved better performance in terms of user engagement metrics such as clicks and browsing time. The increase in the measured performance, however, can have two possible attributions: a better understanding of user preferences, and a more proactive ability to utilize human bounded rationality to seduce user over-consumption. A natural following question is whether current recommendation algorithms are manipulating user preferences. If so, can we measure the manipulation level? In this paper, we present a general framework for benchmarking the degree of manipulations of recommendation algorithms, in both slate recommendation and sequential recommendation scenarios. The framework consists of four stages, initial preference calculation, training data collection, algorithm training and interaction, and metrics calculation that involves two proposed metrics, Manipulation Score and Preference Shift. We benchmark some representative recommendation algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets under the proposed framework. We have observed that a high online click-through rate does not necessarily mean a better understanding of user initial preference, but ends in prompting users to choose more documents they initially did not favor. Moreover, we find that the training data have notable impacts on the manipulation degrees, and algorithms with more powerful modeling abilities are more sensitive to such impacts. The experiments also verified the usefulness of the proposed metrics for measuring the degree of manipulations. We advocate that future recommendation algorithm studies should be treated as an optimization problem with constrained user preference manipulations.},

abstract = {Knowledge distillation is widely used in pre-trained language model compression, which can transfer knowledge from a cumbersome model to a lightweight one. Though knowledge distillation based model compression has achieved promising performance, we observe that explanations between the teacher model and the student model are not consistent. We argue that the student model should study not only the predictions of the teacher model but also the internal reasoning process. To this end, we propose Explanation Guided Knowledge Distillation (EGKD) in this paper, which utilizes explanations to represent the thinking process and improve knowledge distillation. To obtain explanations in our distillation framework, we select three typical explanation methods rooted in different mechanisms, namely gradient-based, perturbation-based, and feature selection methods, Then, to improve computational efficiency, we propose different optimization strategies to utilize the explanations obtained by these three different explanation methods, which could provide the student model better learning guidance. Experimental results on GLUE demonstrate that leveraging explanations can improve the performance of the student model. Moreover, our EGKD could also be applied to model compression with different architectures.},
