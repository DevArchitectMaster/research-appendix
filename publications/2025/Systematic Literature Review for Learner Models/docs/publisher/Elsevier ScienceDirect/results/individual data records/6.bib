abstract = {There is a critical need to make infrastructure systems more efficient, resilient, and sustainable. Infrastructure systems provide the basis for everyday life and enable the flow of goods, information, and services within urban and regional settings. Providing data-centric solutions to improve this flow is essential. This can only be achieved if we manage to transform passive infrastructure assets into cyber-physical systems. Digital twins bring the opportunity to turn passive infrastructure assets into data-centric systems of systems. This article aims to provide a summary of existing digital twin architectures and exemplify a digital twin design and implementation. To this end, a literature review of digital twin architecture is presented in addition to a case study of a digital twin implementation in smart infrastructure. The case study focuses on a digital twin implementation of a bridge and describes in detail the physical, cyber, integration, and service layers of this implementation. Later in the article, we discuss the learnings from this case study under three main categories – systems perspective, information perspective, and organisational perspective. The findings show the importance of acquiring a systems perspective when designing digital twins today to enable interoperable systems of systems in the future. Furthermore, the findings highlight the vital necessity of data and information management while also considering the multidisciplinary aspects of digital twin design and implementation.}

Such digital twins can be used in a wide variety of activities such as optimisation, forecasting of future data, etc. In this respect, forecasting the evolution of time-series data in the future time-steps is often encountered in various engineering systems and applications. In particular, probabilistic forecasting of time-series data over point-based predictions is often encouraged, but challenging to achieve though. In this work, deep learning (DR) technology is combined with various state-of-the-art mathematical optimisation algorithms in order to effectively achieve the ’confidence-based’ probabilistic predictions of Quality of Service (QoS) data emanating from various low-powered Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The results demonstrate that Deep Neural Networks (DNN), if combined with right mathematical optimisation algorithm, can help generating accurate probabilistic forecasts for both single time-series and a combination of multiple time-series data.}

The available research on DT for power plants is limited and lacks details on DT comprehensiveness and robustness. The main focus of the present study is to propose a comprehensive and robust DT architecture for power plants that can also be used for other similar complex capital-intensive large engineering systems. First, overviews are conducted for DT key research and development for power plants and related energy savings applications to provide current status, guidelines and research gaps. Then, the requirements and rules for the power plant DT are established and the major DT components are determined. These components include the physics-based formulations; the statistical analysis of data from the sensor network; the real-time data; the pre-performed localized in-depth simulations to predict activities of the corresponding physical twin; and the system Genome with a digital thread that connects all these components together. Recommendations and future directions are made for the power plant DT development including the need for real data and physical description of the overall system focusing on each component individually and on the overall connections. Data-driven algorithms with capabilities to predict the system’s dynamic behavior still need to be developed. The data-driven approach alone is not sufficient and a low-order physics based model should operate in tandem with the updated latest system parameters to allow interpretation and enhancing the results from the data-driven process. Discrepancies between the dynamic system models (DSM) and anomaly detection and deep learning (ADL) require in-depth localized off-line simulations. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the advantages of the developed ADL algorithm approach and DSM prediction of the DT using vector autoregressive model for anomaly detection in utility gas turbines with data from an operational power plant.}

abstract = {Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) account for a large proportion of energy consumption. Improving the energy efficiency of HVAC and utilizing increased amounts of renewable energy are effective strategies for achieving decarbonization. While thermal storage is one of the key technologies that solves a renewable energy issue that has the temporal and geographical gaps between supply and demand, operation planning using optimization methods, such as model predictive control, is important owing to the complexity of the system. A prediction model with high accuracy and low computational load is required because the performance of model predictive control typically depends on it. Further, to facilitate its extensive use in common buildings, it is necessary to develop a simple modeling method that requires no expertise. This study proposes a framework based on a dual-structured optimization process as a modeling method to create a prediction model. This method was applied to an actual small-scale office building. It was confirmed that such a model which accurately predicts up to 24 h ahead within approximately 1 s can be created.11AHP: air source heat pump chiller; ANN: artificial neural network; DB: dry bulb; DNN: deep neural network; GTHP: geothermal heat pump; HVAC: heating, ventilation and air-conditioning; MAE: mean absolute error; MLR: multi linear regression; MPC: model predictive control; m-PSO: particle swarm optimization incorporating mutation method; PSO: particle swarm optimization; ReLU: rectified linear unit; RMSE: root mean square error; TABS: thermally activated building system; WB: wet bulb; a: weight for DNN; b: bias for DNN; c: coefficient for m-PSO, c1 = c2 = 1.49618; fDNN: function of deep neural network; mrate: mutation rate for m-PSO; n: number of items/elements; r: random value r∈[0,1]; t: time step; tH: prediction horizon; vi: velocity of ith element for m-PSO; w: inertial coefficient for m-PSO, w = 0.7298; x: input data for functions; xgb: global best positions for m-PSO; xpb: personal best positions for m-PSO; yi: observed value of ith element; y^i: predicted value of ith element; φ: activation function; U: uniform distribution value in the available range.}

A digital twin is a promising tool to minimize fruit waste by monitoring and predicting the status of fresh produce throughout its life. In post-harvest engineering, the digital twin could be defined as a virtual representation of real produce. The objective of this work is to present a new approach to create a machine learning-based digital twin of banana fruit to monitor its quality changes throughout storage. The thermal camera has been used as a data acquisition tool due to its capability to detect the surface and physiological changes of fruits throughout the storage. In this study, after constructing the dataset of thermal data belonging to four classes, the training of the model has been performed using intelligent technologies from SAP. The solution has applied a deep convolutional neural network to monitor the fruit status based on the thermal information, and the training process has shown higher accuracy. Thus, 99% of prediction accuracy has been achieved which is proved to be a promising technique for the development of fruit digital twins. The application of thermal imaging techniques can be used as a data source to create a machine learning-based digital twin of fruit that can minimize waste in the food supply chain.}

abstract = {Owing to the advances of data sensing and collecting technologies, more production data of additive manufacturing (AM) systems is available and advanced data analytics techniques are increasingly employed for improving energy management. Current supervised learning-based analytical methods, however, typically require extracting and learning valuable information from a significant amount of data during training. It is difficult to make a trade-off between latency and computing resources to implement the analytical models. As such, this paper developed a method utilizing the knowledge distillation (KD) technique for predicting AM energy consumption based on product geometry information to reduce computational burdens while simultaneously retaining model performance. Through a teacher-student architecture, layer-by-layer images of products and energy consumption datasets are used to train a teacher model from which the knowledge is extracted and used to build a student model to predict energy consumption. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach using real-world data from a selective laser sintering (SLS) system. Comparisons between distilled and independently trained student models were made in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) and training time. The distilled student model performed better (14.3947KWh/kg) and required a shorter training time (34s) than the complex teacher model.}

Commonly, different sensors are integrated into work environments to track workers’ actions. Game elements are selected according to the work task and users’ preferences. However, implementing gamified workplaces remains challenging as different data sources must be established, evaluated, and connected. Developers often require information from several areas of the companies to offer meaningful gamification strategies for their employees. Moreover, work environments and the associated support systems are usually not flexible enough to adapt to personal needs. Digital twins are one primary possibility to create a uniform data approach that can provide semantic information to gamification applications. Frequently, several digital twins have to interact with each other to provide information about the workplace, the manufacturing process, and the knowledge of the employees. This research aims to create an overview of existing digital twin approaches for digital support systems and presents a concept to use digital twins for gamified support and training systems. The concept is based upon the Reference Architecture Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) and includes information about the whole life cycle of the assets. It is applied to an existing gamified training system and evaluated in the Industry 4.0 model factory by an example of a handle mounting.}

The learning factory FleXtory was designed and produced in this objective and at the crossroad of the academic and the industrial environment. It allows running combinations of theoretical and applied tools in the context of industry 4.0.

Therefore, we propose the enhancement of the comprehensive reconfiguration management with transfer learning. This provides the ability to assess the machine learning dependent behavior of the different CPPS configurations with reduced effort and further assists the recommissioning of the chosen one. A real cyber-physical production system from the discrete manufacturing domain is utilized to demonstrate the aforementioned proposal.}

abstract = {The optimization of internal combustion (IC) engine is a highly complex problem because of the high-dimensionality and nonlinear interactions among design parameters. Machine learning (ML) offers a pathway to transform complex physical processes that occur in a combustion engine into compact informational processes. A careful definition of the objective (merit) function for optimization is a critical step. Training data for these ML algorithms must be cleverly prepared to improve the prediction efficiency. Global optimum search optimization methods must be adopted to avoid local optimum designs with reduced merit value. Postprocessing of the optimization outputs is also needed to evaluate the recommended design by employing sensitivity and robustness analysis. In this chapter, a machine learning-genetic algorithm (ML-GA) framework is discussed to optimize the performance of IC engines. ML-GA is comprised of a robust Super Learner approach to build the surrogate model (based on simulation or experimental data), wherein multiple ML algorithms are pooled together instead of a single learner. This Super Learner surrogate is then used to replace expensive simulations or experiments during the course of a GA optimization to rapidly arrive at the optimal design parameters at significantly lower cost. The efficiency and robustness of ML-GA is further enhanced by way of automated hyperparameter selection coupled with an active learning approach. In particular, a Bayesian approach is employed to optimize the hyperparameters of the base learners that make up a Super Learner model to obtain better test performance. In addition to performing hyperparameter optimization (HPO), an active learning approach is leveraged, where the process of data generation, ML training, and surrogate optimization, is performed repeatedly to refine the solution in the vicinity of the predicted optimum. The ML-GA algorithm has been demonstrated for simulation-driven design optimization of advanced IC engines with significant savings in design time and cost compared to traditional optimization methods, as highlighted in this chapter.}

Nevertheless, the development of such systems is still challenging because of the need to integrate multiple fragmented data sources, to apply advanced machine learning techniques for multi-objective optimizations, and to implement configurable digital twins that can flexibly adapt to changing industrial configurations. This paper presents the architecture, design, practical implementation, and evaluation of an end-to-end platform that addresses these challenges. The platform provides the means for collecting, managing, and routing data streams from heterogeneous cyber physical production systems, in configurable and interoperable ways. Moreover, it supports advanced data analytics by means of a novel machine learning framework that leverages quantitative rule mining. The presented platform has been successfully deployed in various industrial settings and has been positively evaluated in terms of its ability to accelerate application development, reduce unscheduled downtimes, provide increased Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE), compute production process parameter configurations that lower the percentage of product defects, and predict product defects before they occur.}

abstract = {Despite the multiple deep knowledge tracing (DKT) methods developed for intelligent tutoring systems and online learning environments, there exists only a few applications of such methods in educational computer games. One key challenge is that a player may deploy several interweaved and overlapped skills during gameplay, making the assessment task nontrivial. In this research, we present a generalizable DKT approach called GameDKT that integrates state-of-the-art machine learning with domain knowledge to model the learners’ knowledge state during gameplay, in an attempt to monitor and trace their proficiency level for the different skills required for educational games. Our findings reveal that GameDKT approach could successfully predict the performance of players in the coming game task using the cross-validated CNN model with accuracy and AUC of roughly 85% and 0.913, respectively, thus outperforming the MLP baseline model by up to 14%. When the performance of players is forecasted for up to four game tasks in advance, results show that the CNN model can achieve more than 70% accuracy. Interestingly, this model seems to be better and faster at identifying local patterns and it could achieve a higher performance compared to RNN and LSTM in both one-step and multi-step prediction of learners’ performance in game tasks.}

It proposes new architectures for digital twins based on local product and resource twins that use digital encapsulated information to create higher level system twins. Using Action Design Research, a first tentative to develop a prototype of this new architecture is presented. A main learning outcome is that the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is an essential part of a digital twin implementation, which receives insufficient research attention. The capability of the PLC largely determines the architecture of a digital twin.}

This paper introduces a novel method for fusing multiple emotional signals, using a weighted average, where each weight value adapts to real time conditions, based on signal type, presence, and quality. In the context of a training station for manual operation, we implemented and tested separately several emotion detection methods, each based on a different signal acquired from audio, video, and galvanic skin response data streams. The final goal is to include the proposed method together with state of the art emotion detection machine learning algorithms as part of the digital twin training station for manual operation.}

The parameters are adapted to gradually improve control performance and deal with changing real-world environment. In particular, the performance metric is not required to be differentiable nor analytical with respect to the control parameters and system dynamics are not necessary linearized. Eventually, the proposed sim2real framework leverages altogether online high fidelity simulator, data-driven estimations, and simulation based optimization to transfer and adapt efficiently a controller developed in simulation environment to the real platform. Our experiment demonstrates that a high control performance is achieved without tedious time and labor consuming tuning.}

A neuro-fuzzy technique is applied to describe HTG, internal Lithium-Bromide temperature, and water outlet temperature. Two Adaptative Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) are trained considering real data of eight days of operation. Then, the obtained model is validated considering two days of real data. The validation shows a RMSE of 1.65e−2 for the internal normalized temperature, and 2.05e−2 for the outlet normalized temperature. Therefore, the obtained Digital Twin presents a good performance capturing the dynamics of the HTG with adaptive capabilities considering that each day can update the learning step.}

The electrical designers insert these devices into their schematic and thus generate a logical version of the model. The layout planner then puts the model into physical form by arranging the devices in the virtual switchgear cabinet. The finished model includes all dimensions and shows the individual devices inside the realistic 3D digital layout. Also included is the entire wiring with all wire paths, cable ducts, top-hat rails (position and length), and all drill holes and cutouts. The haptic representation simplifies many activities, as individual positions in the cabinet are more easily recognized.

CPMS are configurable and intelligent. Environmental and system parameters change frequently. Thus, static models are inadequate. Autonomous mobile robots and the simulation of their movement are important elements of these CPMS. Based on our reinforcement learning-based methodology, we use these robots as an example to show how the Digital Twin automatically improves models that do not perfectly represent the physical asset, making it an intelligent Digital Twin. In our scenario, the behavior of the asset deviates from the simulated prediction, i.e., a simulation gap occurs. The presented approach closes this simulation gap through a three-step mechanism. First, it makes the simulated data and the real data comparable and synchronizes it. Second, it applies reinforcement learning to find patterns in the deviations between the simulated and real data. Third, it learns to compensate for them. The evaluation of this example shows promising results.}

The boiler is generally operated in the range of 40–100 MW using two of five burner levels. In order to optimize boiler performance, we propose the implementation of a unique digital twin. Our digital twin abstraction couples Bayesian inference from science-based models and from observations (machine learning) with decision theory to predict operating-variable set points that optimize the physical asset (the boiler) in the presence of uncertainty (artificial intelligence). We focus this paper on the continuous Bayesian machine learning part of the Atikokan Digital Twin; we discuss decision theory in a companion paper. We identify and learn about 12 operational, model, and measured-output parameters and their uncertainties from high-fidelity, science-based simulations of the Atikokan boiler and from the observed measurements at the power plant. Since the goal of the Atikokan Digital Twin is to implement it online in real time, we require fast function evaluations for the quantities of interest extracted from the simulations in the Bayesian analysis. We use Gaussian process regression/interpolation to create accurate, robust surrogate models. We define the Bayesian priors and likelihood function and solve for the posterior distributions of the 12 parameters. We then propagate these distributions (i.e., parameters with uncertainty) into the predicted distributions of 790 quantities of interest to learn about the relative importance of various sources of error including experimental, model, and operating-parameter errors.}

abstract = {Knowledge tracing (KT) has become an increasingly relevant problem in intelligent education services, which estimates and traces the degree of learner’s mastery of concepts based on students’ responses to learning resources. The existing mainstream KT models, only attribute learners’ feedback to the degree of knowledge mastery and leave the influence of mental ability factors out of consideration. Although ability is an essential component of the problem-solving process, these knowledge-centered models cause a contradiction between data fitting and rationalization of the model decision-making process, making it difficult to achieve high precision and readability simultaneously. In this paper, an innovative KT model, ability boosted knowledge tracing (ABKT)11Our implementations are available inhttps://github.com/ccnu-mathits/ABKT. is proposed, which introduces the ability factor into learning feedback attribution to enable the model to analyze the learning process from two perspectives, knowledge and ability, simultaneously. Based on constructive learning theory, continuous matrix factorization (CMF) model is proposed to simulate the knowledge internalization process, following the initiative growth and stationarity principles. In addition, the linear graph latent ability (LGLA) model is proposed to construct learner and item latent ability features, from graph-structured learner interaction data. Then, the knowledge and ability dual-tracing framework is constructed to integrate the knowledge and ability modules. Experimental results on four public databases indicate that the proposed methods perform better than state-of-the-art knowledge tracing algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy in quantitative assessments, displaying some advantages in model interpretability and intelligibility.}

In the context of ISO standards on geometrical product specifications and verification (GPS), the Skin Model Shapes (SMSs) concept stemmed from the Skin Models paradigm is put forward to represent deviations of mechanical parts in accordance with the nature of geometric deviations on the surfaces. Contributions have been made to generate SMSs by combining both systematic deviations and random deviations on the nominal model. However, the non-ideal surface generation process is limited by the reuse of geometric deviation’s knowledge. Existing geometric deviations that are predicted or observed on the parts cannot be applied for other SMSs generation without new parameter settings using different methods. In this paper, a framework for data-driven geometric deviation generation is proposed for non-ideal surface modeling in tolerancing. A database that contains a variety of deviations generated by different methods is constructed. Deviations that are classified as systematic and random types are represented and stored as samples in the dataset. Deviation pattern identification is addressed by transfer learning using AlexNet and it is used for different types of non-ideal surface generation. Different approaches regarding both prediction and observation stage within SMS schema are included for constructing the deviation samples. The mapping process for both systematic and random deviation samples are considered. Therefore, there is no need to re-design deviations with parameters for the surfaces. A case study is used to illustrate the non-ideal surface generation process by the propose method.}

abstract = {The need to develop faster, more lightweight and flexible Deep Learning (DL) models has led to the development of a wide variety of methods. Among the most well-known methods for improving the accuracy of lightweight DL models is knowledge distillation, also known as knowledge transfer. Knowledge distillation is capable of improving the effectiveness of the training process by transferring the knowledge encoded in a large and complex neural network into a smaller and faster one. This chapter aims to provide an introduction to knowledge distillation approaches by presenting some of the most representative methods that will equip the reader with the necessary knowledge and tools to apply these methods in practice, as well as to follow this rapidly advancing field. First, we present the seminal neural network distillation approach, which kick–started the field. Then we present a generalization of this approach, which provides a general probabilistic view on knowledge distillation, allowing for going beyond classification tasks and overcoming some significant limitations of earlier methods. Multilayer knowledge distillation approaches, which employ multiple layers for the process of knowledge transfer and further improve the effectiveness of distillation, are also presented and discussed. Finally, we present and discuss some more advanced ways to train the teacher model, allowing for deriving more effective distillation methods, such as online distillation methods, which allow for simultaneously training both the teacher and student models, as well as, self-distillation methods, which do not even use a different teacher model and are capable of reusing the knowledge extracted from the student model.}

Furthermore, the low information content of the timeseries used to build the learning datasets represents an additional limitation. In this paper, an approach is presented and examined by means of which identifiable CNC reference runs with particularly high information content can be generated to create a suitable database for machine learning approaches. Moreover, due to the uniqueness of the generated trajectories, the reference runs represent a particularly suitable basis for analytical methods to parameter identification.}

Dynamic process models have become even more critical in the context of Industry 4.0 and the use of digital twins in the last decade. However, the quality and the technology readiness level of digital process models depend crucially on the reliability of the model predictions. In addition to a suitable model structure/hypothesis, the model parameters of the implemented kinetics are of paramount importance. The accuracy of the parameter estimation, in turn, depends on the quantity and quality of the data as well as on the employed parameter identification solving strategies, where ordinary least squares concepts are still the standard. We propose a novel parameter identification concept that combines systems theory and machine learning principles. The parameter identification problem is formulated as a total least squares optimization problem that uses neural ordinary differential equations for surrogate modeling and recalculates the model control inputs with the algebraic differential flatness framework for model inversion. The usefulness of the proposed concept for more precise kinetic parameters is demonstrated with a simulation study of an enzyme-catalyzed biochemical process, where the total least squares approach leads to lower parameter uncertainties compared to the standard concept based on ordinary least squares using the same amount of data.}

abstract = {Digital twins seek to replicate a physical structure in a digital domain. For a digital twin to have close correspondence to its physical twin, data are required. However, it is not always possible, or cost-effective, to collect a complete set of data for a structure in all configurations of interest. It is nonetheless useful to repurpose data to help validate predictions for different configurations and scenarios. This statement is true in drilling applications, where, for example, the length of the drill string is altered throughout operation. This paper demonstrates how transfer learning, in the form of three domain-adaptation methods, — transfer component analysis (TCA), maximum independence domain adaptation (MIDA) and geodesic flow kernel (GFK) — can be used to construct a digital twin for localising torsional friction in deviated wells under structural changes (e.g., when the drill column gets longer). The method uses a physics-based torsional model to train a machine-learning classifier that can localise torsional friction for a given drill string length and diameter, where friction localisation labels are known (source). As the length or diameter of the drill string are altered in the field, transfer learning is utilised to map the classifier from the labelled (source) scenario onto these unlabelled (target) scenarios. As a result, transfer learning improves the performance of the classifier when applied to the target data, and increases the domain of validity for the classifier. The performance of the classifier, and therefore its suitability to new drill-string configurations, is estimated by utilising two different distance metrics between the source and a proposed target dataset.}

We introduce a methodology that enables the inverse determination of fiber orientation state and the in-situ polymer properties by performing tensile tests at the composite coupon level. We demonstrate the approach for the extrusion deposition additive manufacturing (EDAM) process to illustrate one application of the methodology, but the development is such that it can be applied to short fiber-reinforced polymer (SFRP) systems processed via other methods. Currently, developing composites additive manufacturing digital twins require extensive material characterization. In particular, the mechanical characterization of the orthotropic elastic properties of a composite involves extensive sample preparation and testing, therefore the elasticity tensor is generally populated using a micromechanics model. This, however, requires measuring the fiber orientation state in addition to knowing the constituent material properties. Experimentally measuring the fiber orientation state can be tedious and time consuming. Further, optical methods are limited to resolving the orientation of cylindrical fibers or cluster of non-cylindrical fibers, and computed tomography (CT) methods scan regions of volume that are much smaller than a full printed bead. Therefore, we propose a methodology, accelerated by machine learning, to identify the anisotropic mechanical properties and fiber orientation state at the same time. Early results show that inference of the fiber orientation and composite properties is possible with as few as three tensile tests. Our results show that a combination of the choice of the micromechanics model and reliable set of experiments can yield the nine elastic constants, as well as, the fiber orientation state.}

Considering the existing literature on XAI, this paper argues that XAI in education has commonalities with the broader use of AI but also has distinctive needs. Accordingly, we first present a framework, referred to as XAI-ED, that considers six key aspects in relation to explainability for studying, designing and developing educational AI tools. These key aspects focus on the stakeholders, benefits, approaches for presenting explanations, widely used classes of AI models, human-centred designs of the AI interfaces and potential pitfalls of providing explanations within education. We then present four comprehensive case studies that illustrate the application of XAI-ED in four different educational AI tools. The paper concludes by discussing opportunities, challenges and future research needs for the effective incorporation of XAI in education.}

This paper focuses on the integration of these two promising technologies for adoption in real-time and life-critical scenarios, as well as for ease of governance in smart city based applications.

Creating an automation literacy from the Primary School's age is beneficial for pupils because it supports the development of valuable skills that allow the comprehension and analysis of real-world phenomena. Even if many researchers and policymakers have advocated for engineering education since early education, it is usually kept for undergraduate and graduate-level education. What prevents systems theory and control education from being integrated into K12 education is the lack of available educational resources and the lack of indicators to represent the learning gain of students. To help teachers in the latter aspect, a solution can be studying the entire process as a cyber-physical human system (CPHS). The paper consists of a brief report about the work carried out by authors to represent the entire classroom as a CPHS where the physical robots designed by students, humans (teachers and learners), and cybertechnologies are interconnected to accomplish a goal which is learning. The entire infrastructure could be seamlessly deployed into the classroom, supporting learning assessment and the feedback process starting from the deployment of a (quasi) real-time intelligent collection system.}

This paper intends to review the development of dominant families of student models with psychometric theory in early educational research, recent adaptations, and advances with machine learning and deep learning techniques. Our review covers not only the important families of student models but also why they were invented from both theoretical and practical viewpoints with AI and educational perspectives.

abstract = {The emerging autonomous mobile robots promise a new level of efficiency and flexibility. However, because these types of systems operate in the same space as humans, mobile robots must cope with dynamic changes and heterogeneously structured environments. To ensure safety, new approaches are needed that model risk at runtime. This risk depends on the situation and is therefore a situational risk. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to model situational risk based on multi-agent adversarial reinforcement learning. In this methodology, two competing groups of reinforcement learning agents, namely the protagonists and the adversaries, fight against each other in the simulation. The adversaries represent the disruptive and destabilizing factors, while the protagonists try to compensate for them. The situational risk is then derived from the outcome of the simulated struggle. At this point, the system’s Digital Twin provides up-to-date and relevant models for simulation and synchronizes the simulation with the real asset. Our risk modeling differentiates the four steps of intelligent information processing: sense, analyze, process, and execute. To find the appropriate adversaries and actors for each of these steps, this methodology builds on Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA). Using STPA, we identify critical signals that lead to losses when a disturbance under certain conditions or in certain situations occurs. At this point, the challenge of managing the complexity arises. We face this issue using training effort as a metric to evaluate it. Through statistical analysis of the identified signals, we derive a procedure for defining action spaces and rewards for the agents in question. We validate the methodology using the example of a Robotino 3 Premium from Festo, an autonomous mobile robot.}

However, every time that the system receives new incoming datasets, the challenges of ML such as data preparation, feature selection, model selection and performance evaluation, slow down the development process of DT. This paper proposes a MetaAnalyser platform that automates these steps for incoming datasets in real-time. The MetaAnalyser platform through automating data preparation, feature selection, model selection and performance evaluation, is expected to increase the level of agility in the development process of DT and the efficiency of the DT during its lifecycle.

abstract = {In modern agriculture, plant growth digital twin system helps breeders monitor plant growth, increase yield, and provide growth management advice. Research on the single view leaf 3D reconstruction in digital twin systems has achieved relative success. However, in traditional single-view reconstruction algorithms, the leaf reconstruction often contains the problems of low precision, achieving complexity, and slow speed, making it difficult for recovering three-dimensional information about leaves. Consequently, the reconstruction precision is significantly reduced, which further affects the accuracy of single-view leaf 3D reconstruction. In response to this problem, this study proposed a single-view leaf reconstruction approach in plant growth digital twin systems based on deep learning. The method in this paper mainly fuses the advantages of ResNet and differentiable rendering, and the model is used for further enhancing feature extraction capability and reconstruction precision. Finally, the experiment presented in this paper suggests that the method allows for the 3D reconstruction of plant leaves with different shapes using a single view. Moreover, the experiment results show that the F-Score, CD, EMD reached 76.192, 0.808, and 3.567. Compared with other models, the proposed model in this study has higher reconstruction accuracy, 3D evaluation indicators, and prediction results, providing important ideas and methods for recovering the leaves from a single view in a plant growth digital twin system.}

All of this demands enormous efforts to maintain a consistent and reliable database for the ongoing configuration and coordination of the production system. It is thus a remarkable challenge for industrial companies. Real time locating systems (RTLS) with their ability to continuously monitor the current position and parameters (speed, direction, etc.) of process resources (operators, equipment, products, etc.) offer several potential benefits for the manufacturing industry. The potential areas of application can be identified in different layers of production management. They range from data acquisition on shop floor level through reconfiguration of production systems to providing real time feedback for the blue collars. Furthermore, it allows dynamic coordination of production orders for industrial plants via appropriate digital twin (DT) technologies. This paper proposes an original framework for RTLS in industrial environments and presents a case study for framework application at the TU Graz Learning Factory.}

abstract = {Ontology and knowledge-based systems typically provide e-learning recommender systems. However, ontology use in such systems is not well studied in systematic detail. Therefore, this research examines the development and evaluation of ontology-based recommender systems. The study also discusses technical ontology use and the recommendation process. We identified multidisciplinary ontology-based recommender systems in 28 journal articles. These systems combined ontology with artificial intelligence, computing technology, education, education psychology, and social sciences. Student models and learning objects remain the primary ontology use, followed by feedback, assessments, and context data. Currently, the most popular recommendation item is the learning object, but learning path, feedback, and learning device could be the future considerations. This recommendation process is reciprocal and can be initiated either by the system or students. Standard ontology languages are commonly used, but standards for student profiles and learning object metadata are rarely adopted. Moreover, ontology-based recommender systems seldom use the methodology of building ontologies and hardly use other ontology methodologies. Similarly, none of the primary studies described ontology evaluation methodologies, but the systems are evaluated by nonreal students, algorithmic performance tests, statistics, questionnaires, and qualitative observations. In conclusion, the findings support the implementation of ontology methodologies and the integration of ontology-based recommendations into existing learning technologies. The study also promotes the use of recommender systems in social science and humanities courses, non-higher education, and open learning environments.}

However, these models were based on the assumption that the log data was correct. In other words, they do not take into account the possibility of students cheating or memorizing answers, assuming that the test was conducted fairly and impartially. In recent years, many examinations have been conducted online as a countermeasure against COVID-19 (coronavirus) infections, and students may be able to obtain hints for the examinations using the internet or books.

Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems create the heart of buildings. Stable air handling unit (AHU) functioning is vital to ensuring high efficiency and extending the life of HVAC systems. This research proposes a Digital Twin predictive maintenance framework of AHU to overcome the limitations of facility maintenance management (FMM) systems now in use in buildings. Digital Twin technology, which is still at an initial stage in the facility management industry, use Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of things (IoT) and semantic technologies to create a better maintenance strategy for building facilities. Three modules are implemented to perform a predictive maintenance framework: operating fault detection in AHU based on the APAR (Air Handling Unit Performance Assessment Rules) method, condition prediction using machine learning techniques, and maintenance planning. Furthermore, the proposed framework was tested in a real-world case study with data between August 2019 and October 2021 for an educational building in Norway to validate that the method was feasible. Inspection information and previous maintenance records are also obtained through the FM system. The results demonstrate that the continually updated data combined with APAR and machine learning algorithms can detect faults and predict the future state of Air Handling Unit (AHU) components, which may assist in maintenance scheduling. Removing the detected operating faults resulted in annual energy savings of several thousand dollars due to eliminating the identified operating faults.}

Integration of architecture, engineering, and building science with digital sustainability happens on a contributory intensity where intelligence is correlated with making the design and construction process more efficient. A critical consideration in this chapter is the consolidation of all aspects of digitization into one operational model. This is where digital sustainability with a human-cyber-physical scenario comes in to enhance performance and improve living conditions in the built environment. The applicability of intelligent technologies that incorporate distributed sensing and big data addresses characteristics like energy efficiency and heathy living.

A significant part of the urban geometry is residential buildings and their roofs. Modeling of roofs for urban buildings can be divided into three main areas - building detection, roof recognition and building reconstruction. The building and roofs are segmented with the help of machine learning and image processing. Afterwards the extracted information is used to generate parametric models for the roofs using methods from computational geometry. The goal is to create correct virtual models of roofs belonging to many different types of buildings. In this study, a supervised deep learning approach is proposed for the segmentation of roof edges from a single orthophoto. The predicted features include the linear elements of roofs. The experiments show that, despite the small amount of training data, even in the presence of noise, the proposed method performs well on semantic segmentation of roofs with different shapes and complexities. The quality of the extracted roof elements for the test area is about 56% and 71% for mean intersection over union (IOU) and Dice metric scores, respectively.}

abstract = {Metal additive manufacturing (MAM) has emerged as a promising technology to fabricate parts that are nearly impossible to do so by traditional methods. Since MAM is considered an open-loop system, it is not as efficient at fabricating repeatable and high-quality parts as a closed system. Hence, changing the MAM open-loop system to a closed system proves to be an imperative step for producing reliable parts. The direct application of physics or heat transfer or fluid dynamics equations to a MAM system is impossible as several uncontrolled parameters impact each layer fabrication. Thus, leading researchers are focusing on developing a digital twin, a real-time virtual model or digital representation to provide better control of the MAM process. Currently, the digital twin for MAM is in the development stage as the data capture through real-time monitoring, experimental values, and simulations from layer fabrication need to be sorted and stored in a structured manner. The way forward for a consistent quality MAM part is achieved through a digital twin which is explicitly driven by subsets of artificial intelligence such as machine learning and deep learning. More data must be further acquired and utilized to train the machine to learn the algorithm. An overview of artificial intelligence in additive manufacturing for a closed-loop system is presented.}

abstract = {As manufacturing companies around the world face the challenge of reducing CO2 emissions and achieving their climate goals, increasing energy efficiency provides a promising solution while potentially reducing costs. Hydraulic systems are used in a wide range of applications such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning or machine tools and account for approximately 11 % of the electric energy demand in the German industry in 2017. Furthermore, up to 25 million tons of CO2 are emitted annually in Germany as a result of their operation. Against this background, the following paper aims to increase the energy efficiency of hydraulic systems through automated assessment of energy efficiency measures during system operation. Therefore, we present a modular approach for real-time assessing of energy efficiency measures using a digital twin, which contains an expert system combined with real-time simulation models. To detect inefficiencies without time consuming analysis and substantial user expertise, the expert system automatically identifies system leakage and increased flow resistance using a multi-output regression model. Finally, the expert system aims at engaging operators to implement energy efficiency measures by quantifying their respective energy saving potentials. The proposed measures are applied to the virtual representation of a hydraulic system in real-time. Therefore, a Modelica simulation model is developed, which is exported as a functional mock-up unit (FMU) and integrated into a Python framework. If measures lead to an improvement in energy efficiency, these are recommended to the operator. The overall concept is validated using a physical hydraulic system within the ETA Research Factory. The validation of the prototype shows that the developed approach can be applied to industrial applications and help in reducing their energy consumption.}

However, it has too many parameters for real implementation due to dependence on input images in different magnification factors. In addition, magnification-dependent (MD) classification usually performs poorly on unseen samples, although it has lower input image sizes and fewer parameters. This paper proposes a novel method based on knowledge distillation (KD) to overcome the limitation of dissociation between MI classification and MD classification of breast cancer in histopathological images. The proposed KD method includes a pre-trained MI teacher model that is responsible for training an unprepared MD student model developed through only one magnification factor. In the proposed method, the decomposed feature maps of a teacher's intermediate layers are transferred as dark knowledge to a student. According to the experimental results, the student model developed through 40X images yielded accuracy rates of 99.41%, 99.26%, 99.14%, and 99.09% in response to unseen samples of 40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X images, respectively. Moreover, comparison results indicated the competitive performance of the proposed student model as opposed to the state-of-the-art method based on deep learning on BreakHis.}

The main drawback with current process simulation software is the computational time required to obtain a solution convergence towards a new steady-state. Especially when the input or the output to a system are perturbated. This procedure may take up to minutes in large systems or with strong non-linear recycles. Surrogate modelling of digital twins offers the possibility to speed up the time to convergence required by process simulators by substituting the fundamental or rigorous models with machine learning methods and models. In this work, a surrogate modelling methodology is described for extracting a useful amount of data in a domain near the nominal steady-state of the plant for which a digital twin has been created. For each process variable, a plethora of machine learning models are trained and compared. The best-performing models are chosen to predict the behaviour of such process variables. The application of the surrogate modelling framework thus created has been successfully applied to a steady-state simulation, i.e. digital twin, of an acid gas dimethylamine washing process at the Itelyum exhausted oil refinery in Pieve Fissiraga (LO), Italy.}

The European Commission (EC) has launched the European Green Deal communication, setting out the path for a fundamental transformation of Europe. Key element in this policy is a fully sustainable food system outlined in the farm-to-fork strategy. Such strategy requires a systems approach in which all aspects related to the production and consumption of sufficient and healthy food are considered, including economic, environmental (climate, ecosystems) and social aspects.
Scope and approach
Here, we present the systems approach concept for food production, following the farm-to-fork principle as embraced by the EC, and elaborate on how digitalisation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can solve the challenges that a sustainable food system imposes.
Key findings and conclusions
We present a number of research and innovation challenges and illustrate these by some specific examples. It is concluded that AI and digitalisation show great potential to support the transition towards a sustainable food system. This development will impact the roles and interactions of the actors in the entire value chain from farmers to consumers. Policy recommendations are made for a successful future implementation of AI in sustainable food production.}

abstract = {E-learning is a broader term than “m-learning” and “online learning.” The originality is that it provides the learner with the chance to learn anywhere and anytime. As technology is improving, teaching-learning methodologies are also changing by making electronic learning one of the leading trends in the education system. Due to the complexity of the education system, the prospective dynamics of e-learning require the development of a knowledge delivery and evaluation system. In the history of the education system, a pandemic situation created major disruption affecting 1.6 billion learners in 190 countries all over the globe. In this chapter, an evaluation method for assessing the learner assessment in an intelligent e-learning system is presented. Our method is called the probabilistic network (PN) model and is a well-known evaluation method for the learners in a framework. However, evaluation of the learner’s learning and outcomes still remains a challenge. The main objective of this chapter is to add its dimension toward the evaluation of learning outcomes especially for the learners of intelligent e-learning systems. In this case, intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) were the bone for the smooth running of teaching and have been playing an important role in the e-learning system. An ITS is a type of knowledge-based system whose main objective is to effectively complement a human tutor with a computer. Unlike conventional classroom teaching, ITSs have the potential to fit according to an individual learner’s needs. A probability-based ITS structure is suggested in this chapter, consisting of four models, specifically the learner’s action model, the pedagogical model, the knowledge base model, and the learner assessment model. The importance is being given to test the learner level model where an element of complexity has been introduced and handled by the probabilistic network or Bayesian network model. The purpose of this assessment learner model is to correctly determine the level of knowledge of each learner based on their response to the level of questions, where the level of questions is random to the evaluation process of the learner. With the aid of Bayes’ law, the method has integrated into it the complexity and has found positive results that take the possibility of learners into account.}

abstract = {Machine learning approaches, onboard measurements, and widely available wave forecast and hindcast data present an opportunity to develop predictive models for vessel motion forecasting. Detailed vessel motion forecasts would support underway and deployment decisions for safer and more efficient vessel operation. To demonstrate this application, ridge regression and neural network models for heave, pitch, and roll prediction were trained and tested using time-and-place specific, multidirectional wave model parameters as input. Additionally, the performance benefits of providing these predictive models with computationally efficient, physics-based model predictions (PBMPs) of heave, pitch, and roll as additional inputs were examined. Data from approximately 13,500 30-minute windows, measured aboard an operational research vessel, were used to train and test the data-driven models. Data from over 2,500 additional 30-minute windows, measured aboard a sister vessel, were also used to test the versatility of the trained models. The results of this study showed effective reduction of motion amplitude mean-squared error (MSE) values on multiple test datasets relative to the PBMPs alone. The results also showed that inclusion of PBMPs as input to the data-driven models was typically beneficial in terms of MSE reduction, stressing the importance of retaining physics-based information in data-driven models.}

To settle the shortcomings of the current selective ensemble algorithm existing in the selection efficiency and predict outcomes, this paper proposes selective ensemble algorithm basing on stacking ensemble framework. The algorithm mainly uses the agglomerated hierarchical clustering (AHC) algorithm and the metropolis criterion of simulated annealing to select the type and number of base learners. In terms of empirical analysis, Lending-Club data is used to build a multi-classification model. The experimental results show that compared with the single learner model, the AHC-Metropolis selective ensemble algorithm has better performance and stability in predicting multi-classification problems, and can provide a basis for improving the financial risk control system and ensuring national security.}

abstract = {Background
Social distancing is an effective way to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Many students and researchers have already attempted to use computer vision technology to automatically detect human beings in the field of view of a camera and help enforce social distancing. However, because of the present lockdown measures in several countries, the validation of computer vision systems using large-scale datasets is a challenge.
Methods
In this paper, a new method is proposed for generating customized datasets and validating deep-learning-based computer vision models using virtual reality (VR) technology. Using VR, we modeled a digital twin (DT) of an existing office space and used it to create a dataset of individuals in different postures, dresses, and locations. To test the proposed solution, we implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for detecting people in a limited-sized dataset of real humans and a simulated dataset of humanoid figures.
Results
We detected the number of persons in both the real and synthetic datasets with more than 90% accuracy, and the actual and measured distances were significantly correlated (r=0.99). Finally, we used intermittent-layer- and heatmap-based data visualization techniques to explain the failure modes of a CNN.
Conclusions
A new application of DTs is proposed to enhance workplace safety by measuring the social distance between individuals. The use of our proposed pipeline along with a DT of the shared space for visualizing both environmental and human behavior aspects preserves the privacy of individuals and improves the latency of such monitoring systems because only the extracted information is streamed.}

The user-friendly teleoperation approach allows operators from different manufacturing domains to reduce redundant learning costs and intuitively control the robot in advance. Nevertheless, only a few preliminary works have been introduced very recently, let alone its effective implementation in the manufacturing scenarios. To address the gap, this research proposes a novel multi-robot collaborative manufacturing system with human-in-the-loop control by leveraging the cutting-edge augmented reality (AR) and digital twin (DT) techniques. In the proposed system, the DTs of industrial robots are firstly mapped to physical robots and visualize them in the AR glasses. Meanwhile, a multi-robot communication mechanism is designed and implemented, to synchronize the state of robots in the twin. Moreover, a reinforcement learning algorithm is integrated into the robot motion planning to replace the conventional kinematics-based robot movement with corresponding target positions. Finally, three interactive AR-assisted DT modes, including real-time motion control, planned motion control, and robot monitoring mode are generated, which can be readily switched by human operators. Two experimental studies are conducted on (1) a single robot with a commonly used peg-in-hole experiment, and (2) the motion planning of multi-robot collaborative tasks, respectively. From the experimental results, it can be found that the proposed system can well handle the multi-robot teleoperation tasks with high efficiency and owns great potentials to be adopted in other complicated manufacturing scenarios in the near future.}

Due to the expensive computation resource and time cost, the CFD method impedes the realization of real-time modeling for flapping foil. The surrogate model by machine learning is a promising alternative, but it only focuses on the objective functions and ignores the importance of physical fields. Aiming at providing a comprehensive model to predict the aerodynamic characteristics as well as the physical fields, a deep learning based real-time model containing two modular convolutional neural networks are devised in this paper. With the numerical simulations as training dataset, a well-trained model can accurately predict the pressure and velocity fields as well as the lift and moment coefficients in millisecond. Moreover, the global sensitivity analysis and the optimizations are conducted based on this model. By leveraging the automatic differential mechanics in deep learning method, the time consumption for kinematic optimization is accelerated into a minute, which further demonstrates the real-time capability. Overall, the presented deep learning model can provide a reliable and competitive choice for the digital twin of flapping foil energy extraction system.}

Drawing on decades of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) research, we show how to make use of important AIED concepts: (1) learner models; (2) Open Learner Models (OLMs); (3) scrutability and (4) Ontologies. We show how these concepts can be used in the design of OLMs, interfaces that enable a learner to see and interact with an externalised representation of their learning progress. We extend this important work by demonstrating how OLMs can also drive a learner-centred design process of learning data. We draw on the work of Biggs on constructive alignment (Biggs, 1996, 1999, 2011), which has been so influential in education. Like Biggs, we propose a way for teachers to design the learning data in their subjects and we illustrate the approach with case studies. We show how teachers can use this approach today, essentially integrating the design of learning data along with the learning design for their subjects. We outline a research agenda for designing the collection of richer learning data. There are three core contributions of this paper. First, we present the terms OLM, learner model, scrutability and ontologies, as thinking tools for systematic design of learning data. Second, we show how to integrate this into the design and refinement of a subject. Finally, we present a research agenda for making this process both easier and more powerful.}

While traditional SHM practices are based on scheduled and pre-emptive maintenance, the NextGen SHM system, known commonly as Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), has a focus on pro-active condition-based maintenance, forecasting and prognostics — a milestone on the trajectory towards Digital Twin technology. In aircraft, particularly defense fighter air platforms, fatigue-critical high-amplitude cyclic behavior is unavoidable, where rapid fatigue life consumption due to an airframe buffet is one of the most problematic phenomena that engineers have encountered throughout the 4th and 5th generation fighter programs. This paper serves as a point-of-reference consolidating a range of machine learning models, under a single benchmark aircraft Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) loads monitoring problem. Linear regression models, traditional (shallow) artificial neural networks, and deep learning strategies are all explored, where strain sensors are used as inputs to predict representative bending and torsional dynamic (buffet) and quasi-static (maneuver) load spectra on an aircraft wing during transonic buffeting maneuvers. For the benchmark system considered herein, the MISO coherence ranges from high to very weak depending on the load case, hereby providing a unique opportunity to rigorously explore the time-series modeling requirements and make valuable recommendations across a wide range of data-qualities that are likely to be encountered in traditional or modern aircraft data-acquisition systems or, for that matter, in any mechanical systems plagued by fatigue.}

abstract = {Conventional approaches to developing biomaterials and implants require intuitive tailoring of manufacturing protocols and biocompatibility assessment. This leads to longer development cycles, and high costs. To meet existing and unmet clinical needs, it is critical to accelerate the production of implantable biomaterials, implants and biomedical devices. Building on the Materials Genome Initiative, we define the concept ‘biomaterialomics’ as the integration of multi-omics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools throughout the entire pipeline of biomaterials development. The Data Science-driven approach is envisioned to bring together on a single platform, the computational tools, databases, experimental methods, machine learning, and advanced manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing) to develop the fourth-generation biomaterials and implants, whose clinical performance will be predicted using ‘digital twins’. While analysing the key elements of the concept of ‘biomaterialomics’, significant emphasis has been put forward to effectively utilize high-throughput biocompatibility data together with multiscale physics-based models, E-platform/online databases of clinical studies, data science approaches, including metadata management, AI/ Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and uncertainty predictions. Such integrated formulation will allow one to adopt cross-disciplinary approaches to establish processing-structure-property (PSP) linkages. A few published studies from the lead author's research group serve as representative examples to illustrate the formulation and relevance of the ‘Biomaterialomics’ approaches for three emerging research themes, i.e. patient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine. The increased adaptability of AI/ML tools in biomaterials science along with the training of the next generation researchers in data science are strongly recommended.
Statement of significance
This leading opinion review paper emphasizes the need to integrate the concepts and algorithms of the data science with biomaterials science. Also, this paper emphasizes the need to establish a mathematically rigorous cross-disciplinary framework that will allow a systematic quantitative exploration and curation of critical biomaterials knowledge needed to drive objectively the innovation efforts within a suitable uncertainty quantification framework, as embodied in ‘biomaterialomics’ concept, which integrates multi-omics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like machine learning. The formulation of this approach has been demonstrated for patient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine.}

To represent the measurement of 324 sensors mounted in the 18 skin-rib joints of the inboard wing, strain data from the 18 × 18 elements of the FE model in the sensor locations were calculated corresponding to the flight loadings. The strain data from the original structure FE model were employed to train a CNN model that was classified as healthy samples. Damaged elements were then introduced in random locations to produce data samples corresponding to the same set of flight loads for the CNN model training. In the subsequent damage detection process using the trained CNN model, confusion matrix, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were evaluated. The study results show that robust damage detection results can be obtained with 99% accuracy without noise and 97% accuracy with 2% Gaussian noise. In the damage localization process, threshold value was set at 1.5, 2 or 2.5, and 83% overall accuracy was achieved using the CNN model when the threshold value was 1.5. The study demonstrated that the proposed method is efficient, accurate and robust.}

Most learning strategies are object-centered or prior information-dependent, which likely lead to the problems of generalization across objects or scenes. To alleviate this, this work presented an embodiment decision-making method by the marriage between the digital twin epistemology and information-theoretic approach. The initial insight was that the mutual information generated in the interactions between the available vision models and real-world perceptions could decrease the uncertainty of sensing-action processes. Further, the real-time interactive information gains and visual templates constitute the digital twin through bidirectional data flowing and real-time optimization. As a demonstration of concept, on the conveyor-based and vision-guided robotic grasping platform, the robotic grasping experiments of freely placed and moving parts were performed. Experimental results indicated that the autonomous and real-time optimization of the conveyor-based and vision-guided robotic grasping system happens and the adaptability to the real-world changes had been clearly increased. This research suggested that the representation and dynamic capture of the complex interactions between both sides of cyber-physical system could generate new possibilities to the evolution of decision-making paradigm in more complex industrial processes.}

The cloud layer generates inference model generation by deep learning training and updates the inference model in the edge layer to make the field’s machine smart. Especially, human operators’ models are built based on the multimodal fusion in the cloud layer for cognitive function. Also, edge-cloud collaborative computing is presented to implement the proposed framework. Finally, the study is validated with a human-robot-collaboration case involving 5G edge computing.}

This article proposes a prototype of a user-adaptive system for helping patients to obtain their ambulatory prescribed medications when purchasing online in a more convenient manner than traditional methods, and the adoption of artificial intelligence to achieve improvements. The system developed simulates an online pharmacy with an introductory adaptive user interface using Bayesian user modeling for predicting the medication needs of patients. This program is used to show its step-by-step design and functioning.
Methods
The introductory adaptive user interface was developed on Visual C++ of Microsoft Visual Studio. The patient model acquisition and application implementing the learning and inference was performed with a Bayesian Network. The Bayesian network was elaborated with the GeNIe Modeler software, Version 2.3.R4, provided by BayesFusion, LLC. Synthetic data from a synthetically generated dataset of anonymous patients was used. The performance of the system was evaluated through simulations using testing data from the synthetic dataset. The Accuracy of predictions was analyzed.
Results
The Average accuracy was estimated with the average correct recommendations of medications, for different numbers of purchased medications per session. The Average accuracy increased with the number of purchased medications, from 86.3529% up to 92.5303%. The Average wrong recommendations decreased with the increase in the number of purchased medications, from an average of 3.4117 up to 1.5686.
Conclusion
The system quickly and consistently attained high accuracy in predicting the medication categories needed by the patients, potentially being able to save time and effort for the patients by relying on the system's recommendations.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology that can be utilized throughout a construction project lifecycle. Transition to incorporate AI technologies in the construction industry has been delayed due to the lack of know-how and research. There is also a knowledge gap regarding how the public perceives AI technologies, their areas of application, prospects, and constraints in the construction industry. This study aims to explore AI technology adoption prospects and constraints in the Australian construction industry by analyzing social media data. This study adopted social media analytics, along with sentiment and content analyses of Twitter messages (n = 7906), as the methodological approach. The results revealed that: (a) robotics, internet-of-things, and machine learning are the most popular AI technologies in Australia; (b) Australian public sentiments toward AI are mostly positive, whilst some negative perceptions exist; (c) there are distinctive views on the opportunities and constraints of AI among the Australian states/territories; (d) timesaving, innovation, and digitalization are the most common AI prospects; and (e) project risk, security of data, and lack of capabilities are the most common AI constraints. This study is the first to explore AI technology adoption prospects and constraints in the Australian construction industry by analyzing social media data. The findings inform the construction industry on public perceptions and prospects and constraints of AI adoption. In addition, it advocates the search for finding the most efficient means to utilize AI technologies. The study helps public perceptions and prospects and constraints of AI adoption to be factored in construction industry technology adoption.}

Industries have to speed up their production to meet the market's demand for products in a fast changing economy. To prevent breakdowns in the manufacturing lines and further economic loss, steel industries utilize preventive maintenance approach and early replacement of equipment, which is expensive and not optimal. Preventive maintenance can be beneficial in the steel industry and reduce costs, if it is supported by information gathered from previous breakdowns in the production line, such as condition of equipment, environment and further data that can be collected. In this work, historical data and data collected from a digital twin representation of the manufacturing line from Pittini, a steel making industry in Italy, were utilized to gain information on the conditions before a breakdown in the production line. Furthermore, we present a cloud based framework created by utilizing the information and data for optimization and real-time driven preventive maintenance approach and remote control.}

A DT enables interaction with the digital image of the industrial physical objects/processes to simulate, analyze, and control their real-time operation. DT is rapidly diffusing in numerous industries with the interdisciplinary advances in the industrial Internet of things (IIoT), edge and cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and advanced data analytics. However, the existing literature lacks in identifying and discussing the role and requirements of these technologies in DT-enabled industries from the communication and computing perspective. In this article, we first present the functional aspects, appeal, and innovative use of DT in smart industries. Then, we elaborate on this perspective by systematically reviewing and reflecting on recent research trends in next-generation (NextG) wireless technologies (e.g., 5G-and-Beyond networks) and design tools, and current computational intelligence paradigms (e.g., edge and cloud computing-enabled data analytics, federated learning). Moreover, we discuss the DT deployment strategies at different communication layers to meet the monitoring and control requirements of industrial applications. We also outline several key reflections and future research challenges and directions to facilitate industrial DT’s adoption.}

Accordingly, this paper aims to propose a framework of a smart system using the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and digital twin (DT) technologies to realize real-time occupational safety monitoring in the warehouse and ensure synchronized cyber-physical spaces for information traceability and visibility. The unsupervised deep neural structure of stacked auto-encoder (SAE) is designed to identify abnormal stationary from human motion status, which is perceived as a sign of potential accident. The model is developed to automatically update online by cooperating with calibration samples so as to keep in accordance with the evolution of surroundings. The Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and a log-distance path loss model are used to fulfill indoor localization in order for managers to promptly respond to an incident on site. Besides, some intelligent services are enabled to promote the efficiency of safety management. A real-life case study is carried out in an air cargo cold storage warehouse to illustrate the viability and rationality of the proposed system and methods. The elaboration of the implementation is envisioned to facilitate replication and reproduction effectively. The impact of learning features concerned with distance and vibration on the performance of anomaly detection has also been analyzed by experiments. The insights and lessons gained in this study hold the promise of providing a reference or sparking new ideas for researchers and practitioners to meet similar needs in practice.}

This paper proposes the digital twin systems into the IIoT to build model between physical objects and digital virtual systems to optimize the structure of IIoT. And we further introduce federal learning to train the digital twins model and to improve the communication efficiency of IIoT. In this paper, we first establish the digital twins model of IIoT based on industrial scenario. Moreover, to optimize the communication overhead allocation problem, this paper proposes an improved communication-efficient distribution algorithm, which speeds up the training performance of federated model and ensures the performance of industrial system model by changing the update training mode of client and server and allowing some industrial equipment to participate in federated training. This paper simulates the real-word intelligent camera detection to validate the proposed method. Comparing our proposed method with the existing traditional methods, the results show the advantages of the proposed method can improve the communication performance of the training model.}

Methods to extract a Q-matrix from examination results automatically using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) have been explored, and improved methods such as online NMF have been proposed, which extracts an immutable Q-matrix from time-series data. In this study, we propose a data preprocessing method to improve the accuracy of NMF using a co-clustering method called an infinite relational model (IRM).

One of the important problems during the PSM of SBP is that due to significantly large number of SBPs on a process facility it is very difficult to place sensors at small bore connection (SBC) for stress estimation. In absence of the stress values, it is difficult to estimate the remaining fatigue life (RFL) of SBC which further impedes the inspection planning. Thus, in this chapter, a methodology comprising of CFD, FEA and Machine Learning is used to obtain a virtual sensor for estimating stress at the SBC. The input to the virtual sensor is process parameters such as pressure and flow velocity, while the output is the maximum Von-Mises stress at the SBC. Thereafter, probabilistic crack growth law coupled with Bayesian Network is used to develop a DT for RFL estimation of SBP, which in turn is used to obtain reliability curves and inspection plans. Online deployment of the developed DT will give an up-to-date RFL estimates and inspection plans which can be used then be used for PSM of the SBP.}

As we are now transitioning back to the ‘normality’, universities and businesses consider the so-called ‘blended’ or ‘hybrid’ model as a means of facilitating the transition phase. In view of this decision, several studies can be identified wherein blended learning scenarios are proposed and described. The present work constitutes such an effort. Precisely, while adjusting the lens to the didactic of Robotics courses, we propose a blended learning model via which the laboratory activities are performed without the physical presence of the students in the physical context. The aforementioned objective is attained under the aid of the Virtual Reality technology coupled with the Digital Twin model. We hope that the ideas presented in this manuscript will motivate and inspire more researchers, instructional designers, and educators to consider the adoption of such alternative instructional techniques to mitigate the shortcomings that the remote education setting brings and further to improve the overall learning experience.}

Although some recent technologies (i.e., robotic techniques) that are currently in practice can collect objective, quantified data, the inspector’s own expertise is still critical in many instances. Yet, these technologies are designed to replace human expertise, or are ineffective in terms of saving time and labor. This chapter investigates a new methodology for structural inspections with the help of mixed reality technology and real-time machine learning to accelerate certain tasks of the inspector such as detection, measurement, and assessment of defects, and easy accessibility to defect locations. A functional, real-time machine learning system that can be ideally deployed in mixed reality devices and headsets which can be used by inspectors during their routine concrete infrastructure inspection is introduced. The deep learning models to be employed in the AI system can localize a concrete defect in real time and further analyze it by performing pixel wise segmentation while running on a mobile device architecture. First, a sufficiently large database of concrete defect images is gathered from various sources including publicly available crack and spalling datasets, real-world images taken during bridge inspections, and the public images from the internet search results. For defect localization, various state-of-the-art deep learning model architectures are investigated based on their memory allocation, inference speed, and flexibility to deploy different deep learning platforms. YoloV5s model was found to be the optimal model architecture for concrete defect localization to be deployed in the mixed reality system. For defect quantification, several segmentation architectures with three different classification backbones are trained on the collected image dataset with segmentation labels. Based on the model evaluation results, the PSPNet with EfficientNet-b0 backbone is found to be the best performing model in terms of inference speed and accuracy. The selected models for defect localization and quantification are deployed to the mixed reality platform and image tracking libraries are configured in the platform environment, and accurate distance estimation is accomplished using a calibration process. Lastly, a methodology for condition assessment of concrete defects using the mixed reality system is discussed. The proposed methodology can locate and track the defects using the mixed reality platform, which can eventually be transferred to cloud data and potentially used for remote assessments or updating a digital twins or BIMs.}

However, due to the amplitudes of input signals, these models generate too many parameters for practical use. Therefore, they are rarely used on devices with limited computational resources in the newly-emerged technology of the Internet of medical things (IoMT). Knowledge distillation was utilized in this paper to propose a method for bridging the gap between the arrhythmia classification model with multi-lead ECG signals and the arrhythmia classification model with single-lead ECG signals by minimizing the performance decline. The proposed method consists of a teacher model with advanced architecture and a student model with simple architecture. The teacher model was already developed through multi-lead ECG signals, whereas the student model was developed through single-lead signals under the supervision of the teacher. Despite its simplicity, the student model receives the dark knowledge of multi-lead ECG signals from the teacher by imitating the teacher’s behavior in the development process. According to the results, the student model was nearly 262.18 times more compressed than its teacher. Moreover, the student experienced approximately 0.81% of accuracy decline in Chapman ECG with 10646 patients.}

abstract = {Predictive maintenance is a concept linked to Industry 4.0, the fourth industrial revolution, which monitors the performance and condition of equipment during normal operation to reduce failure rates. This chapter deals with a predictive maintenance strategy to reduce mechanical and electrical plants malfunctioning for residential technical plant systems. The developed strategy can guarantee a tailored maintenance service based on machine learning systems, drastically reducing breakdowns after a maximum period of 3 years. The developed strategy evaluates an acceptable components failure rate based on statistical data and combining the average labor costs with the duration of each maintenance operation. The predictive strategies are elaborated on the minimum cost increase necessary to achieve the abovementioned objectives. A case study based on a 3-year period has been developed on a modern residential district in Rome comprised of 16 buildings and 911 apartments. In particular, the analysis has been performed considering mechanical, electrical, and lighting systems supplying the external and common areas, excluding the apartments to avoid data perturbation due to differenced users’ behaviors. The overall benefits of predictive maintenance management through Big Data analysis have proven to substantially improve the overall operation of different plants such as mechanical and electrical plants of residential systems.}

abstract = {In optical networks, a connection (e.g., light-path and light-tree) is set up to carry data from its source to destination(s). When the optical signal transmits through the fiber links and optical devices, the quality of transmission (QoT) degrades due to various physical layer impairments (PLIs), including linear and nonlinear impairments. QoT is an important metric that determines the availability of a connection. Therefore, the QoT guarantee is the premise of successful connection establishment in optical networks. QoT prediction before connections establishment can provide guidance for the routing and resources allocation of connections. In order to receive the correct signal at the receiving end, during network planning design margins are introduced to compensate the inaccuracy of the QoT prediction model itself and its inputs. Improving the accuracy of prediction can make better use of network resources and reduce margins. With the help of strong computing power and data acquisition based on software defined optical network (SDON), machine learning (ML) based models are more suitable for QoT prediction than analytical models that are difficult to derive and computationally heavy. This paper provides an overview on the applications of ML technologies in QoT prediction. Firstly, we elaborate the QoT problem in optical networks, including main QoT influence factors, QoT metrics, and QoT prediction strategies. Then, suitable ML algorithms, the generation of sample data, ML frameworks and the construction of QoT prediction model, are briefly introduced. Next, three solutions of QoT prediction using various ML technologies in recent studies and their practical feasibility are reviewed and discussed in detail. Finally, based on the existing researches, we present some future research directions about the improvement of QoT prediction.}
