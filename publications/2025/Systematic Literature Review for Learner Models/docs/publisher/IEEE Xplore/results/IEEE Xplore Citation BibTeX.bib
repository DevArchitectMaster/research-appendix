  abstract={In order to achieve collaborative learning in network learning system, two primary questions must be solved. First is how to choose and quantify the proper features to build user model. Second is how to divide the users into optimal teams to play the best effectiveness of collaborative learning. Based on the collaborative learning theory, its practical research, and the conditions of network learning system, the paper selects learning interest and knowledge level as user's features, using the methods of educational psychology measurement to quantify these two features so as to establish user model. Considering the elements and some practical teaching cases of collaborative learning, the paper derives the requirements of collaborative learning's basic unit: the collaboration group, and defines three features of collaborative group as: the cohesion within group, the hierarchy within group and the uniformity among groups. Then, the paper builds the group model and put forward the objective function of collaborative learning grouping scheme. Finally, from the perspective of clustering and combinatorial optimization, the paper investigates how to divide the users into collaborative learning's groups. As a result, it comes up the method as follows. Above all, according to the users' learning interest, it uses K-means to cluster the users into different clusters. Then in each cluster, genetic algorithm is adopted for collaborative learning's group division according to the users' knowledge level. Thus, the paper achieves the automatic group division to find the approximate optimal collaboration learning groups. Lastly, through the simulation experiments, the validity of the method is proved.},

  abstract={In this paper a set of student's characteristics that have to be considered in an adaptive and/or personalized programming tutoring system is presented. This set is called K.E.M.Cs and includes: knowledge, errors, motivation and cognitive states. It allows the system to identify the variety of backgrounds of prospective learners of programming, their misconceptions, needs and learning pace. The modeling of K.E.M.C.s is performed through a combination of different student modeling techniques: overlay, stereotypes, fuzzy logic and OCC cognitive theory. The gain of this approach is that the particular student model represents a sufficiently large part of the complex dimensions of a real student of programming. Therefore, it can be the base for the improvement of the quality of the learning process.},

  abstract={Effective teaching-learning process consists of identifying gaps in the student knowledge and filling the gaps by personalized teaching, which is difficult in classroom teaching. An Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) provides personalized instructions to the students based on the student knowledge level and learning preferences. In ITS, the student model plays an important role, as it represents the student knowledge state, which is used to generate lessons, problems, feedback and guidance in a personalized manner. This paper describes student model for an Intelligent Language Tutoring System to learn verb/noun inflection grammar rules of Telugu language. The student model is used to represent the confidence level of a student in applying each grammar rule, which is used by tutor to generate problems to improve in weak areas. A pilot study is done to measure the effectiveness of the system.},

  abstract={Recently, many works have investigated the identification of learner's working memory capacity (WMC) from his/her behavior in learning systems. These works used a mechanism, called dichotomic node network, able to create representation of the learner's WMC taking into account different theories from the literature. However, this mechanism could only provide a binary representation of learner's WMC (High or Low), whereas the WMC is estimated by 7 (plus or minus two) items. This paper presents an alternative based on fuzzy logic for precisely estimate the WMC of the learner while using learning system or playing educational games. The proposed approach can improve the accuracy of learner model and then enable the fine grained recommendations that positively affect the learners' learning.},

Although most of the ITS were used to teach programming, other topics such as database design and computer literacy were also represented. There was a significant overall effect size favoring the use of ITS. There was a significant advantage of ITS over teacher-led classroom instruction and non-ITS computer-based instruction.

  abstract={Learning Management Systems (LMSs) are widely deployed nowadays in higher education institutions. They are mainly designed for formal and instructivist transmission models of learning. We propose a design for a hybrid institutional learning platform that suitably supports the simultaneous coexistence of formal/informal and instructivist/self-regulated learning. The design relies on a social collaborative learning pattern, open group-sourcing, based on peer production and feedback. To match peers' interactions with learners' skills, we align the visitor/resident learner model with the weighted peer production model. In this paper, we describe the different concepts that motivate our model and how it is concretely realized as a learning platform. We finally illustrate the whole with some of experiments and tests.},

  abstract={Traditional e-learning systems have been, typically, designed for a generic learner, irrespective of individual knowledge, skills and learning styles. In contrast, adaptive e-learning systems can enhance learning by taking into account different learner characteristics and by personalising learning material. Although a large number of systems incorporating learning style have been deployed, there is a lack of comprehensive, comparative evaluations. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by comparing a number of adaptive e-learning systems. It considers three main perspectives: the learner model, the domain model and the adaptation model. A set of criteria is generated for each perspective, and applied to a representative sample of adaptive e-learning systems.},

  abstract={The learning systems are designed for learning about a particular area. Then, it is usually necessary to know the state of knowledge of the learner on a domain before customizing or adapting the learning process. In this paper, we are interested in the semantic analysis of the learner's query put on the WEB by using the domain ontology. The purpose of this analysis is to identify the concepts of domain that are most asked on the Web and to keep them into the learner's model as concepts not well mastered. We hypothesize that all concepts sought on the web via the search engine can be considered as knowledge poorly or badly acquired by learners and deserve thus more attention and consideration both by the tutor for the pedagogical monitoring of learners on these concepts and from the designer of course, to restructure and more enrich the educational content which articulates these concepts identified beforehand in this analysis.},

  abstract={Online mentoring is nowadays become popular because it can be used in various applications. Particularly in education area, the mentoring generally means the interactions between the teachers as the mentors and the students as the mentees. In order to work together successfully, this paper believes that not only some common attributes between the mentor and the mentee are required but also some compatible different attributes. This paper thus proposes the attributes for online monitoring model named compatible different attributes. There are 2 sets of compatible different attributes including mentee and mentor attributes. Both sets are represented in different size of matrix elements. The objective of this paper is thus to study to which extent the proposed compatible different attributes can be used for online mentoring model. The empirical study is conducted with 74 lectures and 588 students from Faculty of Information and Technology, Rajabhat Maha Sarakham University. They are asked to complete the survey questionnaire to obtain the satisfaction value. Consequently, the satisfaction results show that the proposed attributes can reasonably be used for online monitoring model.},

  abstract={We have developed a web-based, interactive, watershed planning system called WRESTORE (Watershed Restoration Using Spatio-Temporal Optimization of Resources) (http://wrestore.iupui.edu) that allows stake-holder communities to participate in a democratic, collaborative form of optimization process for designing best management practices (BMPs) on their landscape, while also optimizing based on subjective, qualitative landowners' criteria beyond the usual socio-economic, physical, and ecological criteria. This system utilizes multiple advanced computational approaches including the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrologic model for watershed simulations, interactive genetic algorithms and reinforcement-based machine learning algorithms for search and optimization, and deep learning artificial neural networks for user modeling, within an encompassing human-computer interaction framework. A substantial user study of the WRESTORE system was conducted recently involving multiple real stakeholders varying from consultants, government officials, watershed alliance members, etc., with the objective of gaining insight about WRESTORE'S usability and utility. In particular focus was the user modeling component that develops a computational model of a user's preferences and criteria, based on real-time user-provided ratings for a subset of possible designs (similar to the idea of user profiling commonly done for human-computer interaction systems). The user model constructed based on the real user's personalized feedbacks can then be used to influence the automated search and optimization for BMP alternatives in WRESTORE. In this paper, we describe the methods developed for user modeling for interactive optimization, and the experimental set-up as well as results with real user studies. These results clearly demonstrate that development of user models for such personalized, interactive optimization is both feasible and valuable for developing community-based computational water sustainability solutions.},

  abstract={An Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) provides direct customized instruction or feedback to students while they perform a task in a tutoring system without the intervention of a human. One of the main functions of an ITS system is to present its students with course materials that are most appropriate to their current knowledge of domain concepts, example being one of the course materials. ITS systems typically compare and analyze student model (SM) components for student's current knowledge of concepts (main topics, e.g. Scanf in C programming) that are required to understand the next example (e.g. Codes for scanf) suitable for learning a task (e.g. Write C code to read 2 integers from the keyboard). Existing systems such as NavEx and PADS perform an exhaustive matching of student knowledge level with all examples in the database. This research proposes a task-based technique for managing and classifying examples for more effective retrieval of relevant examples for learning a task. We propose a system called EASK for translating task and example solutions into concepts for similarity matching, which is more readily available, easily extendible and adaptable to other domains. Examples and tasks are represented as vectors of weights computed with term frequency measure TFIDF that signify the importance of a concept for an example. Examples most similar to a task are found by using a classification method called k-NN, which finds the closeness between different objects such as examples and tasks using cosine similarity measure and selecting the k objects (examples) with highest similarity scores. As a by-product, k-NN also predicts the class label (difficulty level) of the task. Our proposed model achieves this prediction with 89% accuracy.},

  abstract={Adaptive learning systems require student model repository that store student's data in order to provide learning materials tailored to the student's characteristics. Student's learning style is one of the most crucial factors to be identified in order to update the student's profile. Hence, the need for a high accurate classifier that deals with the students data and generates suitable number of rules that can automatically identify student's learning style in adaptive learning environments is an important issue. In this paper, Bijective soft set algorithm is used in classifying students learning style based on Felder Silverman learning style model. The discernible matrix parameter reduction was used to generate attributes reducts, whereby rules were generated from these reducts. Experiments were carried out using simulated data with various attributes that represent student's characteristics according to the four dimensions of Felder Silverman model. The experiments revealed that Bijective soft set gives high classification accuracy with suitable number of rules. The algorithm was further verified with Rough Set and FURIA as a comparative analysis of the performance of the proposed model.},

  abstract={The design of the digital resource is an expensive process that consumes time and money. By optimizing an adaptive process would reduce time for the designers and users. The increase in the production of digital data in these last few years has raised several issues regarding the management of heterogeneous and multiple source data in the user's environment. In this paper, we focus on adaptive digital resource modelling to assist users in the consolidated management of digital resources in an interactive and adaptive system. In this paper we propose an approach of digital resources modelling which will make the use of digital resources more adaptive. We introduce an adaptive resource model which includes LOM (Learning Object Metadata) metadata, manipulation rules and operators. This model allows an automatic adaptation to user's profiles and user's contexts. An experimental implementation called PRISE (Personal Interactive research Smart Environment) is carried out in our laboratory. PRISE is an interactive and adaptive system to assist researchers in using and managing their digital resources efficiently. PRISE architecture is based on three essential parts of the system : the user model, the process model and the resource model. Our aim is to maintain a consistency in terms of interaction between the users and the digital resources.},

  abstract={We propose a model for deployment of software tutors. In the model, the first stage of the pre-test-practice post-test evaluation protocol is used to initialize the student model needed for adaptation. In order to keep assessment congruent with learning, the same type of activity is used in all three stages of evaluation, and the software tutor itself is used to administer all three stages of the protocol. In order to minimize time while maximizing learning, post-test is set to adapt to practice, and students are also provided feedback after pre-test activities on which they provide incorrect response. Finally, the software tutor is set up to administer the pre-test-practice-post-test protocol as one seamless integrated session with no discernible breaks between the stages. This model of deployment helps the developer evaluate the effectiveness of the software tutor, helps the student minimize time while maximizing learning and enables the instructor to obtain concept-level summary of what worked and what needs to be reviewed again in the classroom. The deployment model has been implemented in software tutors for programming, called problets (problets.org). We produce quantitative data from three problets used in spring 2013 to illustrate the benefits of the deployment model that accrue to developers, students and instructors.},

User modeling system is the heart of adaptive learning. This research proposes a novel user modeling system named Zebra which manipulates students' characteristics in the effective way. Moreover, Zebra provides powerful inference mechanism for reasoning out new information about students in order to support adaptive learning in the best way. Zebra is implemented as computer software and so, the purpose of this paper is to introduce Zebra - a novel and powerful user modeling system.},

  abstract={Digital libraries on distance learning platforms are ways that allow learners to consult and enrich their knowledge on the content that are studied in their course. In this paper, we are interested in the semantic analysis of the content of the resources visited in the digital libraries (eBooks) by learners using domain ontology. The purpose of this analysis is to identify the domain concepts that are most consulted and read by learners from the digital libraries and to keep them into the leaner's model as concepts not well mastered. We hypothesize that all domain concepts visited in resources from the digital libraries can be considered as knowledge poorly or badly acquired by learners and merit thus more attention and consideration both by the tutor for the didactic monitoring of learners on these concepts and from author of course, to restructure and more enrich the educational content which articulate these concepts identified beforehand in this analysis.},

  abstract={The web is increasingly moving towards structuring and to taking into consideration of semantics, particularly with XML and ontology. In addition, access to information requires the use of web tools for information retrieval (IR). Many methods from traditional IR were extended to structured documents. On the other hand, approaches have been proposed to regard specifically semantics in structured documents by using external semantic resources while collecting original documents on which it is necessary to provide semantic similarity measures in order to perform comparisons between concepts. Most previous approaches did not take into account the relations between concepts and are not tailored to the specific needs of learners. In this paper a semantic IR system of structured educational documents is proposed and adapted to the needs and preferences of the learner. This approach is based on a representation of the nodes of the document's tree and of the query through the semantic vectors of those concepts. Tests show the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={We aim to provide grammar error feedback to learners. It is known that grammar error detection and feedback are challenging problems in written language, however, they become much more difficult tasks in oral conversation because it is difficult for a system to judge whether an error is due to grammar or automatic speech recognition (ASR). False alarms occur when a learner correctly utters a remark, but the system gives feedback implying an error. Minimizing the false alarm rate is especially critical in education applications because it is imperative that the tutor give correct instruction to learners. Thus, to reduce the false alarm rate in grammar error detection and feedback, we apply a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) when the system provides feedback about a learner's mistake. The POMDP models uncertainty between grammar errors and ASR errors. An additional advantage of our method is that “belief states” in POMDP can be used for learner models which indicate each individual learner's grammar comprehension level.},

User-friendly interface design visualization tools directly influence the sustainability of learners' motivation to continuously engage with the instruction. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for enhancing the motivation of learners in an open learner model environment. Such a framework incorporates six motivational open learner model tools, which are in alignment with the attention (A), relevance (R), confidence (C), and satisfaction (S) model's motivational components respectively. The integration of these tools not only will enhance learners' motivation in engaging with open learner models, but also assist learners to sustain their motivation in dealing with this instruction. The findings of this study will assist designers to develop a more effective open learner model to enhance and sustain learners' learning motivation in technology-assisted learning environments.},

  abstract={Peer-assessment can be used to evaluate the knowledge level achieved by learners, while exposing them to a significant leaning activity at the same time. Here we see an approach to semi-automatic grading of school works. It is based on peer-assessment of answers to open ended questions (“open answers”), supported by the teacher grading activity performed on a portion of the answers. The methodology we present is based on a representation of student model and answers through Bayesian networks. It supports grading in a six-values scale (the widely used “A” to “F” scale). The experiments we present test the possibility to model the fact that knowledge required to perform some work is preparatory to that required for a subsequent one. The experiments have been conducted using the web-based system OpenAnswer and were meant to collect datasets, to be exploited in order to evaluate the various algorithms, settings and termination conditions better to be applied in order to have a reliable set of grading out of the learners' peer-assessment process and the teacher's grading work (with the latter limited to a significantly limited percentage of the answers to be graded).},

The goal of any ITS system is to help the students to achieve maximum learning gain and improve their engagements to the systems by capturing the student's interests through the system's adaptive behavior. In other words an ITS system is always developed with the aim of providing an immediate and efficient solution to student's learning problems. In recent years a lot of work has been devoted to improving student and tutor models in order enhance the teaching and learning activities within the ITS systems.

The use of fuzzy logic in this context is to enable the computational analysis of the student's characteristics and learning behaviours in order to handle the uncertainty issues related to the student model design.

  abstract={In this paper, a novel approach to web-based education that performs individualized instruction on the domain of programming languages is presented. This approach is fully implemented and evaluated in an educational application module, called fuzzy knowledge state definer (FuzKSD). In particular, FuzKSD performs user modeling by dynamically identifying and updating a student's knowledge level of all the concepts of the domain knowledge. The operation of FuzKSD is based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) that are used to represent the dependences among the domain concepts. FuzKSD uses fuzzy sets to represent a student's knowledge level as a subset of the domain knowledge. Thus, it combines fuzzy theory with the overlay model. Moreover, it employs a novel inference mechanism that dynamically updates user stereotypes using fuzzy sets. It should be noted that the overlay model and stereotypes constitute two widely used methods for user modeling. However, they have not been combined with fuzzy sets thus far in the literature. The gain from this novel combination is significant as a student level of knowledge is represented in a more realistic way by automatically modeling the learning or forgetting process of a student with respect to the FCMs and thus the system can provide individualized adaptive advice. The application of this approach is not limited to adaptive instruction. It can also be used in other systems with changeable user states, such as e-shops, where consumers' preferences change over time and affect one another. Therefore, the particular module constitutes a novel generic fuzzy tool, which offers dynamic adaptation to users' needs and preferences of adaptive systems.},

  abstract={We present the design, implementation, and preliminary evaluation of our Adaptive Educational System (AES): the Mobile Integrated and Individualized Course (MIIC). MIIC is a platform for personalized course delivery which integrates lecture videos, text, assessments, and social learning into a mobile native app, and collects clickstream-level behavioral measurements about each student as they interact with the material. These measurements can subsequently be used to update the student's user model, which can in turn be used to determine the content adaptation. Recruiting students from one of our Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), we have conducted two preliminary trials with MIIC, in which we found (i) that the majority of students (70 percent) preferred MIIC overall to a one-size-fits-all (OSFA) presentation of the same material, (ii) that the mean level of engagement, when quantified as the number of pages viewed, was statistically higher (by 72 percent) among students using MIIC than among OSFA, and (iii) that the integrated multimedia learning features were generally favorable among the students (e.g., 87 percent found the videos helpful).},

  abstract={We introduce FCUBE, a cloud-based framework that enables machine learning researchers to contribute their learners to its community-shared repository. FCUBE exploits data parallelism in lieu of algorithmic parallelization to allow its users to efficiently tackle large data problems automatically. It passes random subsets of data generated via resampling to multiple learners that it executes simultaneously and then it combines their model predictions with a simple fusion technique. It is an example of what we have named a Bring Your Own Learner model. It allows multiple machine learning researchers to contribute algorithms in a plug-and-play style. We contend that the Bring Your Own Learner model signals a design shift in cloud-based machine learning infrastructure because it is capable of executing anyone's supervised machine learning algorithm. We demonstrate FCUBE executing five different learners contributed by three different machine learning groups on a 100 node deployment on Amazon EC2. They collectively solve a publicly available classification problem trained with 11 million exemplars from the Higgs dataset.},

Therefore, the user interface should be adapted to the needs of each geographical location to provide optimal user experience.

The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, a generic adaptive framework aimed at enhancing learning is proposed. Second, a specific approach to adaptivity based on learning style is put forward within the framework. Third, the framework is validated and the approach is evaluated in order to determine their effectiveness in learning provision in an adaptive e-learning system. An experiment conducted with 60 participants produced positive results. They indicate that adapting instructional material according to learning style yields significantly better learning outcome and learner satisfaction than without adaptation.},

  abstract={Personalization and adaptation are at the core of Intelligent Tutoring Systems. The Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) Student Model is a time-tested method that maintains information about students' knowledge levels for the different skills in the topic domain. In our previous work, we had proposed the Personalized, Clustered, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (PC-BKT) model that individualizes the learning of skills for each student and additionally improves the prediction for the cold start problem. A clustering of both students and skills based on a student and skill capability matrix was used to learn the prior skills to deal with the cold start problem, which is the prediction for either new skills or new students. Both the BKT and the PC-BKT models assume that a skill once learnt is never forgotten. But forgetting is pervasive. If a previously learnt skill is not used for a while, there is a higher chance of forgetting it. One of the factors that influence the forgetting is the time duration before the current attempt at using a skill and the previous attempt. We incorporate forgetting as a time decay function in the BKT and PC-BKT models and show significant increase in the accuracy of the student prediction.},

Although industry has started specifying trades through competencies, similar attempts are not initiated for education yet. In this paper, we present a unifying model for training programs, professions and learners, built around competencies. Based on this model, several tools have been developed to help (1) educational teams to make sure that conceptions of curriculum fit the targeted learning objectives, (2) learners to make their careers choices through life easier, (3) industrial actors to identify training programs matching with their needs.},

To develop such system, two learner models (rule based model and clustering model) were built using 80 presentations graded by three human experts. An experiment to determine the best learner model and students' perception was carried out using 51 presentations uploaded by students. The findings show that the clustering model classified in a similar way as a human evaluator only when a holistic evaluation criterion was used. Whereas, the rule-base model was more precise when the evaluation rules were easier to be followed by a human evaluator. Furthermore, students agreed with the usefulness of the system as well as the level of agreement with the grading model, although the latter in a lesser extent. Results from this study encourage to explore this area and adapt the proposed Intelligent Tutor System to other existing automated grading systems.},

  abstract={Various motivational designs have been introduced to improve learners' motivations in engaging with technology-mediated learning. This study presents an investigation of the impact of learning preferences on their motivations towards the attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) motivational design in an open learner model (OLM) environment. Data was collected from undergraduate students in a university in Malaysia by using an online survey. A chi-square test was performed to explore the relationship between learning preferences and motivations in a higher education setting. The result reveals that an ARCS motivational design can impact learners' motivations towards the adoption of open learner models. The implications of this study will assist educational institutions to develop more effective and efficient policies for improving the adoption of open learner models in technology-mediated teaching and learning.},

  abstract={Naturally every individual is unique. Thus, learning process in every learner is also different. On the other hand, education requires every learner to achieve a certain standard of competency. Standards are made to ensure all learners meet the defined learning outcome. In order to help learner achieve the targeted competency based on their own pace and way of learning, we propose personalized e-learning architecture that complies with standard. This study explores various theories and best practices of e-learning and confronted with various ways of learning due to cultural diversity in Indonesia. The analysis reveals components that commonly play important part in personalization: integrated learning structure, learner model, personalized learning scenario, personalized content selection, and portfolio-based assessment. These five components are interrelated to compose personalized e-learning system. The proposed architecture facilitates various ways of learning as well as aligns with expected learning outcome. A prototype system of the proposed architecture will be built in future to show the contribution.},

  abstract={Biometric systems have been applied to improve the security of several computational systems. These systems analyse physiological or behavioural features obtained from the users in order to perform authentication. Biometric features should ideally meet a number of requirements, including permanence. In biometrics, permanence means that the analysed biometric feature will not change over time. However, recent studies have shown that this is not the case for several biometric modalities. Adaptive biometric systems deal with this issue by adapting the user model over time. Some algorithms for adaptive biometrics have been investigated and compared in the literature. In machine learning, several studies show that the combination of individual techniques in ensembles may lead to more accurate and stable decision models. This paper investigates the usage of some ensemble approaches to combine the output of current adaptive algorithms for biometrics. The experiments are carried out on keystroke dynamics, a biometric modality known to be subject to change over time.},

  abstract={Computing Environment for Human Learning (CEHL) systems are based on the use of new technologies to improve the quality of learning. However, their training suffers from a crucial problem mainly in the construction of the adapted learning process according to the needs of the learner. In fact thousands of educational resources are available through the web today. Therefore, the learner gets lost and hesitated to choose the most adequate educational resources according to their preferences and state of knowledge. This paper aims to define reusable, accessible and adapted educational resources. For reusing phase, we propose to define a composed educational resource by assembling existing resources through an appropriate schema called also a narrative structure. For the adaptation, we propose a new general learner model. We treat not only the pedagogic aspect, but also the psychological aspect of the learner by including models from cognitive theories such as the MBTI model (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator).},

We describe our approach which has the particularity to put some order within personal learning environment. Moreover, we propose in our approach to assist the learner in the more complex phases of his learning. In fact, an effective learning experience must be based on a clear learning objective and a detailed curriculum describing the specific learning objectives. In traditional learning systems, online or offline, those tasks are made by experts. However in personal learning environment, the learner himself must build the personal learning environment. Thanks to our approach throw the use of ontologies, Bloom taxonomy, and learner profile, is able to assist the learner to accomplish the mentioned tasks without a direct need for experts.},

  abstract={Working memory is the system used by every human for temporarily storing and managing the information required to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning, reasoning and comprehension. In particular, working memory capacity plays an important role in learning process, because learner often have to hold information in mind while engaged in a learning activities. Having information about learners' WMC could be helpful to support them during the learning process. Khenissi et al. [1] proposed an approach based on fuzzy logic for learner's modeling while using educational games and/or e-learning system. This paper will detail the description of the mechanism proposed by Khenissi et al. [1]. Furthermore, it will describe how the system architecture will be improved by the automatic generation of the fuzzy logic components. In particular, the machine learning, web services and the model of educational games are adopted for automatically generate the components of the fuzzy logic system. The automatic generation of these components will help the expert in parameterizing them, and thus better estimation of the learner's WMC.},

  abstract={One of the most important element for adapting and personalizing Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) is the learner model because it contains a lot of useful information about an individual such as learning preferences, academic performance and learning styles. These latter, which are increasingly being incorporated into TEL, and seems to be a promising concept for making learning easier for students. The application of these concepts in traditional learning is almost impossible as we only have one teacher with thirty or even hundreds of students in a class, so he can not apply an adaptive learning for each of them. However, the emergence of adaptive learning management system (LMS) offers a great advantage for students, as it allows them to have a personalized learning process that can be suited with their needs and characteristics. Now days, many researchers has been working in this area. The purpose of this article is to propose a learner model ontology SLMonto based on popular student modeling standards. As well as the representation of the prior knowledge of the student's performance, motivation, and the learning style which is adapted from Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model.},

  abstract={Social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook have become an important forum for peer interaction. Micro-blogging offered by such outlets allows people to publish, share and discuss short messages on the web. In academic institutions, micro-blogging offers a backchannel forum during live classes. It is popular among group of friends and professional colleagues who can also update content and follow each other's post, creating a sense of online learning forum. Latent use of social media and micro-blogging services in education, students and academicians embracing these technologies by sharing everything from personal to general interests and current events. Our Research motive is to embed social networking software into Learning Management System. As an initial step, we aim to analyze and compare micro-blogging behavior of different users in the academic institutions. Students experience, perceptions, attitudes and interactions may differ because online social sites are relatively new in the academic research. The result shows their posting behaviors, activities and perceived benefits. Result and findings helped us to build a user model and got an initial understanding of how students and faculties are likely to use micro-blogging in and out of academic institution.},

  pages={496-503},
  abstract={The exponential and rapid growth of the E-commerce based both on the new opportunities offered by the Internet, and on the spread of the use of debit or credit cards in the online purchases, has strongly increased the number of frauds, causing large economic losses to the involved businesses. The design of effective strategies able to face this problem is however particularly challenging, due to several factors, such as the heterogeneity and the non-stationary distribution of the data stream, as well as the presence of an imbalanced class distribution. To complicate the problem, there is the scarcity of public datasets for confidentiality issues, which does not allow researchers to verify the new strategies in many data contexts. Differently from the canonical state-of-the-art strategies, instead of defining a unique model based on the past transactions of the users, we follow a Divide and Conquer strategy, by defining multiple models (user behavioral patterns), which we exploit to evaluate a new transaction, in order to detect potential attempts of fraud. We can act on some parameters of this process, in order to adapt the models sensitivity to the operating environment. Considering that our models do not need to be trained with both the past legitimate and fraudulent transactions of a user, since they use only the legitimate ones, we can operate in a proactive manner, by detecting fraudulent transactions that have never occurred in the past. Such a way to proceed also overcomes the data imbalance problem that afflicts the machine learning approaches. The evaluation of the proposed approach is performed by comparing it with one of the most performant approaches at the state of the art as Random Forests, using a real-world credit card dataset.},

A specific implementation of this approach is presented by which learners' self-direction and self-determination in a social e-learning context could be potentially promoted. Unlike previous work, the proposed approach, multifaceted OSLM, lets the system seamlessly and adaptively embed visualization of both a learner's own model and other learning peers' models into different parts of the learning content, for multiple axes of context, at any time during the learning process. It also demonstrates the advantages of visualizing both learners' performance and their contribution to a learning community. An experimental study shows that, contrary to previous research, the richness and complexity of this new approach positively affected the learning experience in terms of perceived effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

  abstract={Learning Management System (LMS) has been used widely in many institutions to implement e-learning. This is due to the flexibility of LMS to deliver the learning materials in various ways and approaches. However, the heterogeneous of students' behavior, the diversity of learning materials and the complexity of hyperlink for navigation are the main factors of limitation in LMS and can caused cognitive overload among students. Many literatures show that, providing an e-learning system that considers student preferences and needs can improve student performances and understanding. Therefore, this research proposed a new framework to enhance LMS to support adaptive features. The proposed enhancement of LMS is implemented in Moodle platform which includes major adaptation features based on visual and verbal dimension of Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM) and the student's knowledge level. The enhanced framework is organized into three models; domain model, student model and adaptive model that need to interact together to perform adaptively in presenting the learning materials. Three multi-agent components have been added to the Moodle platform to implement the adaptation. The current Moodle repository has also been modified by creating additional fields that are necessary for adaptation.},

  abstract={The Internet has become an integral part of our everyday life. Unfortunately, not all of us are equally aware of the threats when we use online services. Naive users are generally less aware of security and privacy practices on the Internet and are susceptible to online predators. In this paper, we present a behavioral analysis of Internet users and their susceptibility to online malpractices. We have considered the dataset from the Global Internet User Survey for 10789 respondents to perform a security-oriented statistical analysis of correlated user behavior. We constructed logistic regression models to analyze the statistical predictability of susceptible and not-so-susceptible identity theft victims based on their behavior and knowledge of security and privacy practices. We posit that such a study can be used to assess the vulnerability of Internet users and can hence be used to leverage institutional and personal safety on the Internet by promoting online security education, threat awareness, and guided Internet-safe behavior.},

  abstract={An adaptive learning system is an alternative learning method for the traditional “one-size-fits-all” approach in learning. With adaptive learning systems a user will get a learning scenario and materials that fit their needs and characteristics. Adaptation is produced by the main components of adaptive learning systems, including the domain, goal, user, adaptation and presentation models. In this paper, we discuss our analysis and design of knowledge tracing, a method for inferencing the user and domain models, which supports knowledge tracing. We implemented a cognitively-oriented domain model represented in a graph and studied the influence of slip, guess, and learning rate parameters, in addition to user's performance, to pCorrect, which is a probability that the user can solve a problem. Our analysis of the algorithm and the experiment results show that slip parameter is inversely proportional to the pCorrect, while guess is directly proportional to pCorrect.},

  abstract={The high development of emerging computing paradigms, such as Ubiquitous Computing, Mobile Computing, and Social Computing, has brought us a big change from all walks of our work, life, learning and entertainment. Especially, with the high accessibility of social networking services along with the increasingly pervasive use of portable wireless mobile computing devices, more and more populations have been engaged into this kind of integration of real physical world and cyber digital space, which can be called the hyper world. To help people live better in the highly developed information society, the so-called cyber-individual (Cyber-I), which is far beyond a user model or a software agent to assist a user, has been proposed to provide the most comprehensive digital entities for its corresponding Real-I in terms of the individual's experience, behavior, and thinking as well as his or her birth, growth, and death. In this study, we concentrate on the personal data analytics to facilitate the cyber individual modeling. Organic Stream is introduced to systematically organize and refine the personal stream data, which can help improve the data processing and management in the CI-Spine tier and CI-Pivot tier of Cyber-I. The DSUN (Dynamically Socialized User Networking) model is employed to better utilize the collective intelligence from a group of users, which can help improve the CI-Mind tier to make Cyber-I to become more robust. Based on these, we discuss the functional modules for the facilitation of cyber individual modeling. Finally, a scenario is given, and the experimental results are presented to demonstrate that the valuable outcomes from the personal analysis can be utilized to enrich the Cyber-I, and provide users with more suitable services.},

  abstract={This paper builds upon theoretical studies in the field of social constructivism. Lev Vygotsky is considered one of the greatest representatives of this research line, with his theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). Our work aims at integrating this concept in the practice of a computer-assisted learning system. For each learner, the system stores a model summarizing the current Student Knowledge (SK). Each educational activity is specified through the deployed content, the skills required to tackle it, and those acquired, and is further annotated by the effort estimated for the task. The latter may change from one student to another, given the already achieved competence. A suitable weighting of the robustness (certainty) of student's skills, stored in SK, and their combination are used to verify the inclusion of a learning activity in the student's ZPD. With respect to our previous work, the algorithm for the calculation of the ZPD of the individual student has been optimized, by enhancing the certainty weighting policy, and a graphical display of the ZPD has been added. Thanks to the latter, the student can get a clear vision of the learning paths that he/she can presently tackle. This both facilitates the educational process, and helps developing the metacognitive ability self-assessment.},

Multiple approaches are used to model these environments, but only a few of them deal with adult education, which is becoming more and more important, as adult learners are increasingly interested in online education. In fact, learner models-, which are the foundation of adaptive learning systems-that exist nowadays, are limited to modeling only a few learner's characteristics such as learner's knowledge and competencies, but they neglect other parameters that are as important for the adult learner. This paper aims to identify adult learners' different characteristics, and to define a taxonomy that can aid the design of a model that incorporate the adult learner in an adaptive learning environment.},

  abstract={This paper presents a dynamic Bayesian network model for the assessment of students' algebraic knowledge in step-based intelligent tutoring systems. The proposed work assesses knowledge about concept, skills, and misconceptions of learners. Furthermore, the proposed model is independent of the problems provided by the system (i.e., equations), because it considers the algebraic operation used by the student to solve a step as evidence instead of the final solution provided by the student. Results of evaluations comparing student's performance on a posttest with the inference of the proposed model showed statistically significant similarities between them, indicating that the inference performed by the model was accurate.},

  abstract={Many students in higher education are required to complete graduate work while learning state-of-the-art technologies and theories in their laboratories. To obtain their objectives efficiently, although it is important that students accumulate, share, and apply "research know-how", these are generally tough tasks because most students graduate without conveying their know-how to juniors. Inspired by the concepts of Knowledge Management (KM) and Human-Agent Interaction (HAI), we previously proposed a system to support the research activity of students. It presents appropriate know-how based on two types of model: the first expresses relationships between tagged information, the second represents features and trends of information retrieved and evaluated by the students. In this paper, we conducted several experiments using the prototype of our developed system: (i) to evaluate the validity of the user model constructed for respective users (students) based on their usage history of the prototype system, and (ii) to discuss whether the user model adequately estimates users' trends in terms of know-how retrieval/evaluation.},

  abstract={The aim of this paper is to present the adaptive learning system called ALS_CORR[LP]1. This system belongs to a very specific class of the e-learning systems, which is the adaptive learning ones. In fact they have the ability to adapt the learning process according to each learner needs, learning styles, objectives, etc. ALS_CORR[LP] is based on the learner prerequisites and the learning styles of Felder-Silverman, to design the learner model. As for the domain model, it is designed according to the recommendations of the differentiated pedagogy, which advocates creating multiple versions of the same learning object. Finally in order to ensure the adaptation inside the system, a Bayesian network, to match the designed learning object with the specifics of the learner profile was developed. It is also necessary to emphasize, that the major feature of the system is, its ability to correct the generated learning path in case of a failure in the evaluation phase. The learning path relevance is questioned, based on a recommendation system which enables updating the initial profile, or recommending the most relevant versions of the learning object, in case where the similarity calculation in behavior, reveals that the observed behavior in the system does not fit the initial profile description.},

Apparently, studies on user preference across gender for adaptive tutoring systems remain scarce among university users in Malaysia. With the aim of describing the differences between genders in user preferences for the method of gaining information, online games, online movies, online music, pictures, as well as colors of the adaptive tutoring system, this paper used quantitative methods through data gathering for finding the results of this study. Sixty-eight respondents were chosen from among academicians, administrative staff and students of a public university in Malaysia. Descriptive analysis of the data shows that there exists a pattern of different preferences for adaptive tutoring systems across gender.

In this case study, a Next-App prediction service is built to demonstrate the use of the framework and to evaluate the usefulness of such a prediction service. Next-App analyses a user's data, learns patterns, makes a model for a user, and finally predicts based on the user model and current context, what application(s) the user is likely to want to use. The prediction is pro-active and dynamic; it is dynamic both in responding to the current context, and also in that it responds to changes in the user model, as might occur over time as a user's habits change.

  abstract={Real-time adaptation of computer games' content to the users' skills and abilities can enhance the player's engagement and immersion. Understanding of the user's potential while playing is of high importance in order to allow the successful procedural generation of user-tailored content. We investigate how player models can be created in car racing games. Our user model uses a combination of data from unobtrusive sensors, while the user is playing a car racing simulator. It extracts features through machine learning techniques, which are then used to comprehend the user's gameplay, by utilising the educational theoretical frameworks of the Concept of Flow and Zone of Proximal Development. The end result is to provide at a next stage a new track that fits to the user needs, which aids both the training of the driver and their engagement in the game. In order to validate that the system is designing personalised tracks, we associated the average performance from 41 users that played the game, with the difficulty factor of the generated track. In addition, the variation in paths of the implemented tracks between users provides a good indicator for the suitability of the system.},

We apply a feature extraction approach based on the frequent pattern mining of gesture sequence to the user modeling. The learned user model detects types of problems in real time and is used for automated help. To optimize of instruction timing and its selection, we use a Bayesian reinforcement learning approach, which balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off. We evaluate the effectiveness of the method by using a prototype assistant system for a map application. The evaluation with older (60+) novice users showed positive results.

AEHS constitutes three basic modules, the content module, the adaptation module and the user module. The user module is the heart of the system, based on which the adaptation module personalize the content. A User models in AEHS is either static, i.e the information about the user characteristics is collected and updated before starting the adaptation or in habitual intervals, or dynamic where the user information is updated continuously as the user interact with the system.

  year={2016},
  volume={28},
  number={3},
  pages={372-386},
  abstract={Designers of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) have long been interested in delivering personalized teaching to individual students, typically by ensuring that the student receives content appropriate to their skills and knowledge. Nonetheless, a more holistic view on what constitutes good teaching practice has challenged whether this approach to user modelling is sufficient. Teaching is not only defined by what is taught, but also by how it is taught. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploratory design research can support this view by generating a more inclusive set of user attributes for purposes of user modelling. Through a case study, we show that design research for user modelling can function as a boundary object serving three important roles that underpin more specifically the design of user modelling and more broadly ITS design. First, design research can establish common ground by encapsulating domain knowledge in an accessible form. This can support diverse project stakeholders to make decisions on what is to be modelled. Secondly, design research can reveal a wide range of teaching and learning perspectives that in turn introduce transparency to the decision-making process of user modelling and provoke a sense of criticality and accountability amongst project stakeholders. Thirdly, design research can build new bridges between the design of the technology and the user model that underpins it. To this end, user attributes deemed important, yet too complex or cumbersome to develop, can become design principles in the context of the overall ITS design. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS We highlight how the creation of user models rarely incorporates assistance from the HCI community. We present a series of design activities intended to assist in the creation of a User Model. We examine how this design-oriented methodology creates a boundary object. We discuss the three benefits this boundary object brings to constructing user models, namely establishing common ground, creating transparency when considering possible alternatives and creating a springboard for new activities.},

  abstract={This paper proposes an approach for developing curriculum-level open student models. This approach entails evaluating student core competencies using the correspondence between courses and core competencies in a competency-based curriculum and students' taken courses and grades. On the basis of this approach, a curriculum-level, competency-based visualized analytic system, called visualized analytics of core competencies (VACCs), was implemented. Course-competency diagnostic tools, course work performance radar charts, and peer-based ranking tables were developed as part of the VACC analytic system for student reflection and to position their levels of core competencies. These curriculum-level open student models revealed multiple aspects of students' core competencies by monitoring the quantity and quality of courses taken by students, and evaluating students' ranks regarding core competencies compared with their classmates and graduates. VACC evaluation was conducted in this paper. The results showed that more than 70% of students reported that VACC helped in reflecting on their core competencies, assisting them in understanding the correspondence between their taken courses and core competencies, and helping them to set goals regarding taking additional courses. In addition, this paper discusses potential analytics and applications of open student models of core competencies.},

  abstract={Existing tools aim to detect university students with early diagnosis of dyslexia or reading difficulties, but there are not developed tools that let those students better understand some aspects of their difficulties. In this paper, a dashboard for visualizing and inspecting early detected reading difficulties and their characteristics, called PADA (acronym for the Spanish name Panel de Analíticas de Aprendizaje de Dislexia en Adultos), is presented. PADA is a web-based tool designed to facilitate the creation of descriptive visualizations required for a better understanding by students about their learner model. Through information visualization techniques, PADA shows students the knowledge in their learner models in order to help them to increase their awareness and to support reflection and self-regulation about their difficulties in reading. PADA provides different learning analytics on reading performance of students, so that they can self-identify their strengths and weaknesses and self-regulate their learning. This paper describes examples that cover a variety of visualizations (bar-charts, line-charts, and pie-charts) to show user model fragments as personal details, reading profiles, learning styles, and cognitive traits of the students. We tested PADA with 26 students (aged 21-53 years) of different academic programs and levels, dyslexic and non-dyslexic. The results show that PADA can assist students in creating awareness, and help them to understand their difficulties associated with the reading tasks, as well as facilitate reflection and self-regulation in the learning process. Implications for the design of learning analytics are discussed and directions for future work are outlined.},

  abstract={Data mining is known to have a potential for predicting user performance. However, there are few studies that explore its potential for predicting student behavior in a procedural training environment. This paper presents a collective student model, which is built from past student logs. These logs are first grouped into clusters. Then, an extended automaton is created for each cluster based on the sequences of events found in the cluster logs. The main objective of this model is to predict the actions of new students for improving the tutoring feedback provided by an intelligent tutoring system. The proposed model has been validated using student logs collected in a 3D virtual laboratory for teaching biotechnology. As a result of this validation, we concluded that the model can provide reasonably good predictions and can support tutoring feedback that is better adapted to each student type.},

  abstract={Adaptive educational hypermedia (AEH) has been an alternative tool to replace conventional learning tools. It mainly offers adaptive navigation and presentation based on a wide range of characteristics, preferences and understanding of learners. The adaptation is enabled by a user model which records users' characteristics, domain models which represent all concepts taught in a course and relationships among them, and goal and adaptation models that infer domain and user models to produce adaptation. The main adaptation offered in AEH deals with where a learner can go next. However, it does not inform learners how far they are from the goals. This paper addresses the problem of finding the shortest path to reach a learning goal. We propose a modified Dijkstra algorithm applied to a graph-based domain model. It takes account of learners' knowledge, the weight of topics in a course and the influence scores of each topic to learn the other topics to predict the possibility of success in learning a topic. Based on the success possibility scores, learning paths are recommended to students. Since students' knowledge is progressive, the success possibility scores are dynamics and they will result in a dynamic learning path adaptive to students' progress.},

We then examine how the agreement between the teacher's best labels and the original labels affects the student model's performance. Next, we show that knowledge distillation can be easily applied to semi-supervised learning to improve model performance. We also propose a promising data selection method to filter un-transcribed data. Then we focus on knowledge transfer among DNN models with multilingual features derived from CNN+DNN, LSTM, VGG, CTC and attention models. We show that a student model equipped with better input features not only learns better from the teacher's labels, but also outperforms the teacher. Further experiments suggest that by learning from each other, the original ensemble of various models is able to evolve into a new ensemble with even better combined performance.},

  abstract={We describe the architecture of a small remote laboratory made available by means of a web-based adaptive system (Mindlab2). The system supports hands-on e-learning experiences with robotics and automation, performed via internet. It allows the learners to access and solve “problems”, submit their solutions and have them evaluated. The problems are defined by the teacher, also specifying instructional aspects, such as the learner's skills involved in producing a solution. For each individual learner a personal Student Model is maintained, recording learner's knowledge and skills, as shown by the solved problems. The access to the problem is guarded by the system, ensuring that the problems can all be “seen” by any student, whereas a learner can work on a problem only if its prerequisites are covered, or anyway “not too far” from her current competences. The available automata are modular structures of various origin (a robotic arm connected to an Arduino platform, and some Lego MindStorm builds, in various configurations). Such hardware is reasonably sophisticated in terms of functions, enjoys a wide provision of sensors and actuators, so allowing for presenting the learners with a good deal of problems, and is sufficiently affordable in terms of cost. Making the learner choose and sequence the problems to undertake, with the only limitation of the problem affordability measured by the student model, allows learners to follow a highly personalizable learning path in a pedagogically controlled setting, which we submit is conducive to better engagement and learning results.},

  abstract={Sharing economy becomes an emerging issue in urban life. It is not a new phenomenon but an assembling of existing techniques to meet specific demands of users. It also points out a better way to implicitly collect users' contexts and to understand users than the conventional one that requires much user involvement (e.g., tedious inputs). A universal model, for this purpose, that supports dynamic analysis and mining of user-generated content (or contexts) is designed in this paper. Two major factors, sensing and analysis of crowd preference and their decision-making behavior, are especially targeted. This model formulates the given scenario that comprehensively illustrates the possible actors and correlated actions among them with a set of rules to enhance the machine learning results. This model outlines a detail process on pre-/post-process of the data, and indicates the core techniques for user modeling. The raw data collected from on-service website, i.e., Airbnb, are utilized for the preliminary examination of our proposal. We especially look at internal factors (e.g., nationality, gender, and age) and external factors (e.g., device, social media, and time) that reflect implicitly the difference on crowd's preference and behavior. Results after statistics-based machine learning reveal that the relation among users' internal and external factors share high similarity with their behavior patterns, and can be applied, considering particular features, for service provision to a specific type of crowds.},

In this manner, this article presents an approach for predicting academic performance based on ontologies and Bayesian networks. A knowledge assessment module was developed and integrated to a Ubiquitous Learning Environment (ULE) in real and actual use. During three semesters, five graduate classes were analyzed with the intent of verifying the correlation between the grades generated by the module and the actual grades obtained by the students. It was noted that 80% of the analyzed samples obtained very high or substantial correlations. This indicates that the proposed module is adequate for identifying and predicting academic performance.},

  abstract={Since last two decades virtual education has brought with it big challenges for higher education, which suppose having in mind the feasibility of delivering digital scenarios that adjusts to learner's characteristics. Thus, our first concern involves distinguishing heterogeneity of student's characteristics who can access this modal of education. Other issue to have in mind is to provide a Learning Management Systems (LMS) that can be adapted to student's characteristics from that diversity. This paper focuses on presenting a learner model with regards to educational special needs, in order to achieve some adaptation through an LMS. The model was built based on a particular data set identified in previous studies done, that include: demographics, competences, reading profile, learning styles, and cognitive traits [1]. The main objective of this model is to bring adaptive recommendations, provided through a LMS, aimed to higher education students with some learning difficulties, particularly those who have dyslexia or reading difficulties.},

Usually, the teacher encounters how to give learners insights into the language grammatical structure and how to find a proper way to help learners grasp a new kind of skill. To address this problem, learners' learning styles and competences should be focused on. In this paper, we propose a new Java language teaching scheme based on the learners' learning styles and competences. Furthermore, we develop a new learner model which is the core of the proposed adaptive learning system. The system was developed for Java language teaching and we implemented an experiment to identify its effectiveness. The experimental result shows that learners' ability of solving practical application problems and the enthusiasm of learning Java language have been significantly improved. Teachers can also be accurate and objective in the evaluation of learners' learning.},

  abstract={In the era of E-Learning, most research on learner model is focused on the analysis of learning-related data, but ignored the analysis of the multidimensional data and relationship among them. This will make it difficult to constructing dynamic, real-time and accurate learner model. However, in the era of U-Learning, the learning device has powerful ability of sensing the context awareness. With these context-awareness technologies, the U-Learning system can collect multi-sensor data intelligently, and then analyze these data by ubiquitous computing, providing learners with timely and accurately personalized study guide. With the wide use of context-awareness technology in the education field, this paper discusses how to use context-aware technology to design dynamic and accurate individualized learner model. Firstly, we describe the contextual factors and classification involved in the U-Learning environment, and then analyze the relationship of contextual factors and learner characteristics. Secondly, we choose an appropriate algorithm to analyze the multi-sensor data which sense and identify learner context automatically, discussing the design of dynamic and real-time learner model by pattern matching and context reasoning. Finally, we propose a framework of learner model which is based on the analysis result of context-aware computing, and then focus on the design prototype system to enhance U-Learning system of adaptive ability.},

Although generic user models have been developed, users may require extensive individualization to meet their personal needs. Machine learning techniques may be applied to learn tailored intervention policies for users. However, traditional machine learning requires significant amounts of data to learn an optimal policy. For wearable technology, this may mean probing the user to perform some activity and gauging user response. This paper presents a feasible intervention system model and discusses learners for tailoring user intervention policies. We examine how similar the general user model has to be with respect to the tailored model in order for our learner to perform well.},

  abstract={This paper contributes to the development of randomized methods for neural networks. The proposed learner model is generated incrementally by stochastic configuration (SC) algorithms, termed SC networks (SCNs). In contrast to the existing randomized learning algorithms for single layer feed-forward networks, we randomly assign the input weights and biases of the hidden nodes in the light of a supervisory mechanism, and the output weights are analytically evaluated in either a constructive or selective manner. As fundamentals of SCN-based data modeling techniques, we establish some theoretical results on the universal approximation property. Three versions of SC algorithms are presented for data regression and classification problems in this paper. Simulation results concerning both data regression and classification indicate some remarkable merits of our proposed SCNs in terms of less human intervention on the network size setting, the scope adaptation of random parameters, fast learning, and sound generalization.},

  title={Predicting Student Performance in an ITS Using Task-Driven Features}, 
  year={2017},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={168-175},
  abstract={Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are typically designed to offer one-on-one tutoring on a subject to students in an adaptive way so that students can learn the subject at their own pace. The ability to predict student performance enables an ITS to make informed decisions towards meeting the individual needs of students. It is also useful for ITS designers to validate if students are actually able to succeed in learning the subject. Predicting student performance is a function of two complex and dynamic factors: (f1) student learning behavior and (f2) their current knowledge in the subject. Learning behavior is captured from student interaction with the ITS (e.g. time spent on an assigned task) and is stored in the form of web logs. Student knowledge in the subject is represented by the marks they score in assigned tasks and is stored in a specific component of the ITS called student model. In order to build an accurate prediction model, this raw data from student model and web logs must be engineered carefully and transformed into meaningful features. Existing systems such as LON-CAPA predict students performance using their learning behavior alone, without considering their (current) knowledge on the subject. Lack of proper feature engineering is evident from the low values of accuracy of their prediction models. This research proposes a highly accurate model that predicts student success in assigned tasks with a 96% accuracy by using features that are better informed not only about students in terms of the two factors f1 and f2 mentioned above, but also on the assigned task itself (e.g. task's difficulty level). In order to accomplish this, an Example Recommendation System (ERS) is designed with a fine-grained student model (to represent student data) and a fine-grained domain model (to represent domain resources such as tasks).},

  abstract={One of the core model of the Tutor System is considered to be Student model, which pays special attention to student's cognitive and affective states and their evolution as the learning process advances. As the student works step-by-step through their problem solving process the system engages in a process called model tracing. Anytime the student model deviates from the domain model the system identifies, or flags, that an error has occurred. This helps in the shorter feedback cycle for the student and help them in overcoming these shortcomings through the recommendation engine. The tutor model accepts information from the domain and student models and makes choices about tutoring strategies and actions. At any point in the problem-solving process the learner may request guidance on what to do next, relative to their current location in the model. Knowledge tracing tracks the learner's progress from problem to problem and builds a profile of strengths and weaknesses relative to the production rules. The tutor system gives a visual graph of the learner's success in each of the monitored skills related to solving problems. When a learner requests a hint, or an error is flagged, the know ledge tracing data and the skill meter are updated in real-time. The Another core feature of the tutor system is its recommendation engine which on the basis of the skill meter that is updated at the real time will find what all are the things that the student may be interested on and suggest him the path that could be more fruitful. And last the tutor system is able to builds student profiles while observing student performance throughout the interaction of the system.},

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate various training methods for building deep neural network (DNN) based acoustic models for dysarthric speech data. Methods like multitask learning, knowledge distillation and model adaptation, which overcome data sparsity and model over-fitting problems are employed to study the merits of each method. In Knowledge distillation framework, some privilege information in addition to featurelabels pairs available only during training, is exploited to help the model learn better without using such previleged information during testing [1]; knowledge from one model can be distilled to another and thereby guiding it in learning better [2]. In this work, a DNN acoustic model trained using data pooled from Dysarthric speech data and parallel un-impaired data is used as the intelligent teacher while the student DNN model is trained using only Dysarthric speech. The target label for training the student model is a combination of hard aligned labels and those obtained from forward-pass through the teacher model. In addition to this technique, other knowledge sharing techniques like multitask learning were explored for Dysarthric speech data and have found to show a relative improvement of 11% over the corresponding baseline models.},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={Current learning management systems such as Moodle and WebCT are considered as linear systems that provide e-learning material in a fixed-sequence, delivering the same content to learners regardless of their differences in background knowledge. For learners engaged in self-study online distance learning, this may result in material being presented at either too high or too low cognitive levels. According to the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory, this may result in either frustration or boredom among learners. This paper proposes a recommender-system-based adaptive e-learning framework for personalised teaching on e-learning platforms. The framework would assist designers, teachers and learners to identify issues they need to consider in order to address challenges of poor engagement in online distance settings, arising from a “one-size-fits-all” approach that does not recognise the role of individual differences in teaching and learning. Secondly, the framework may enable the identification of problems or obstacles that may be encountered when supporting learners in their quest to reduce frustration and boredom when using a Recommender-Based Pedagogical System (RBPS). A literature review was conducted on adaptive e-learning systems based on the ZPD theory, learner modelling, the Generic Adaptive Framework and a recommendation system model. 70 articles were selected from a database of 720 articles published between 2010 and 2017 to come up with the dimensions needed to develop such a model for the framework through deductive analysis. The research found out that the majority of the studies only consider three dimensions to an adaptive framework, that is, the learner model, the content model and the adaptation engine while the Generic Adaptation Framework proposes seven dimensions. In addition, the majority of the studies are based on the principles of macro-adaptation which provide a “static” snapshot of a learner's profile instead of dynamically adjusting the adaptation as learner variables. In the proposed adaptive framework, we identified five dimensions, including real-time dynamic adaptation and context modelling in addition to the learner model, the domain model and the pedagogical strategy.},

Scientific challenges in the field of Industry 4.0 and intra-logistics are identified due to the new form of interaction between humans and machines. This kind of collaboration provides new possibilities of materials handling that can be developed with the support of real-time motion data tracking and virtual reality systems. These services will be provided by a new research centre for flexible human-machine cooperation networks in Dortmund. By the use of various reference and experiment systems various real-time scenarios can be emulated including digital twin simulation concepts. Big data emerges as an important paradigm in this research project where all systems are made flexible in terms of networking for all the systems to consume the data produced and also to combine all the data to arrive at new insights using concepts from machine learning and deep learning networks. This leads to the challenge of finding a common syntax for inter-operating systems.

Monitoring and modeling has been completed through the text modeling process by evaluating the student expressions within the chat session using MADAMIRA tool and machine learning. MADAMIRA tool enables the modeling process to categorize Arabic text into different categories, which makes it easier to use the levels of the used expressions and discover the importance of the chat session between two peers. The process of the student modeling using MADAMIRA and Machine learning will update the student model which gathers information about the student achievements within the AVCM.},

  abstract={The application of machine learning models to the analysis of network measurement problems has largely increased in the last decade; however, there is still no clear best-practice or silver bullet approach to address these problems in a general context, and only adhoc and tailored approaches have been evaluated so far. While deep-learning models have provided a major breakthrough in highly-dimensional problems such as image processing, it is difficult to say today which is the best model to address the analysis of large volumes of highly-dimensional data collected in operational networks. In this paper we present a potential solution to fill this gap, exploring the application of ensemble learning models to multiple network measurement problems. We introduce GML Learning, a generic Machine Learning model for the analysis of network measurements. The GML model is a generalization of the well-known stacking approach to ensemble learning, and follows the concepts of the Super Learner model. The Super Learner performs asymptotically as well as the best input base or weak learners, providing a very powerful approach to tackle multiple problems with the same technique. In addition, it defines an approach to minimize over-fitting likelihood during training, using a variant of cross-validation. We deploy the GML model on top of Big-DAMA, a big data analytics framework for network measurement applications. We test the proposed solution in five different and assorted network measurement problems, including detection of network attacks and anomalies, QoE modeling and prediction, and Internet-paths dynamics tracking. Results confirm that the GML model provides better results than any of the single baseline models of the stack, and outperforms traditional bagging and boosting ensemble learning approaches. The GML Learning model opens the door for a generalization of a best-practice technique for the analysis of network measurements.},

  abstract={Driven by the challenges of rapid urbanization, cities are determined to implement advanced socio-technological changes and transform into smarter cities. The success of such transformation, however, greatly relies on a thorough understanding of the city's states of spatiotemporal flux. The ability to understand such fluctuations in context and in terms of interdependencies that exist among various entities across time and space is crucial, if cities are to maintain their smart growth. Here, we introduce a Smart City Digital Twin paradigm that can enable increased visibility into cities' human-infrastructure-technology interactions, in which spatiotemporal fluctuations of the city are integrated into an analytics platform at the real-time intersection of reality-virtuality. Through learning and exchange of spatiotemporal information with the city, enabled through virtualization and the connectivity offered by Internet of Things (IoT), this Digital Twin of the city becomes smarter over time, able to provide predictive insights into the city's smarter performance and growth.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks have shown significant success across various applications. To solve the complex problems, the increasing depth and complexity pose the challenges of large computation and storage requirements when deploying such networks on embedded devices with limited storage and power. Many techniques have been developed by researchers to compress the deep neural networks to make them deployable on portable devices by reducing the storage requirements. This paper describes the implementation of deep neural network with teacher student model. A comparatively smaller student model learns the information passed from the larger teacher model without losing the accuracy and its learning/inference rate is also improved. So this kind of framework is suitable for embedded applications deployment where real-time performance is required.},

Our research group has proposed and developed a system, called the KM-ReAct, which provides such students with useful information that can contribute to competence in their research activities, based on the concept of Knowledge Management. The proposed system presents information that we call “research know-how” using a know-how model and user model. The results of several experiments confirmed that knowhow information appropriate to respective users was provided by the combination of these two models. However, since all subjects in the experiments were in the field of computer science, it is not yet known if KM-ReAct can help students in other research areas obtain suitable know-how. In this study, we evaluated the suitability of the proposed system for students with different areas of expertise, and compared evaluation results between two research laboratories in different departments.},

  abstract={Mobile learning in massive open online course (MOOC) evidently differs from its traditional ways as it relies more on collaborations and becomes more fragmented. We present a cloud-based virtual learning environment (VLE) which can organize learners into a better teamwork context and customize micro learning resources in order to meet personal demands in real time. Particularly, a smart micro learning environment was built by a newly designed Software as a Service (SaaS), namely Micro Learning as a Service (MLaaS). It aims to provide adaptive micro learning contents as well as learning path identifications customized for each individual learner. To personalize the micro learning, a dynamic learner model is constructed with regards to the internal and external factors that can affect learning experience and outcomes. Educational data mining (EDM) techniques are employed as the main method to understand learners' behaviors and recognize learning resource features. A solution of learning path optimization is also proposed towards assembling a complete MOOC learning experience.},

  abstract={We propose a method of generating teaching policies for use in intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) for concept learning tasks [1] , e.g., teaching students the meanings of words by showing images that exemplify their meanings la Rosetta Stone [2] and Duo Lingo [3] . The approach is grounded in control theory and capitalizes on recent work by [4]  , [5] that frames the teaching problem as that of finding approximately optimal teaching policies for approximately optimal learners (AOTAOL). Our work expands on [4] , [5] in several ways: (1) We develop a novel student model in which the teacher's actions can partially  eliminate hypotheses about the curriculum. (2) With our student model, inference can be conducted  analytically rather than numerically, thus allowing computationally efficient planning to optimize learning. (3) We develop a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical control technique that allows the teaching policy to search through deeper learning trajectories. We demonstrate our approach in a novel ITS for foreign language learning similar to Rosetta Stone and show that the automatically generated AOTAOL teaching policy performs favorably compared to two hand-crafted teaching policies.},

  year={2018},
  volume={13},
  number={3},
  pages={621-636},
  abstract={The recent advances in mobile technologies have resulted in Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled devices becoming more pervasive and integrated into our daily lives. The security challenges that need to be overcome mainly stem from the open nature of a wireless medium, such as a Wi-Fi network. An impersonation attack is an attack in which an adversary is disguised as a legitimate party in a system or communications protocol. The connected devices are pervasive, generating high-dimensional data on a large scale, which complicates simultaneous detections. Feature learning, however, can circumvent the potential problems that could be caused by the large-volume nature of network data. This paper thus proposes a novel deep-feature extraction and selection (D-FES), which combines stacked feature extraction and weighted feature selection. The stacked autoencoding is capable of providing representations that are more meaningful by reconstructing the relevant information from its raw inputs. We then combine this with modified weighted feature selection inspired by an existing shallow-structured machine learner. We finally demonstrate the ability of the condensed set of features to reduce the bias of a machine learner model as well as the computational complexity. Our experimental results on a well-referenced Wi-Fi network benchmark data set, namely, the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion data set, prove the usefulness and the utility of the proposed D-FES by achieving a detection accuracy of 99.918% and a false alarm rate of 0.012%, which is the most accurate detection of impersonation attacks reported in the literature.},

  pages={866-871},
  abstract={One of the challenges in adaptive learning systems is to manage learner models that include learners' profiles and activities and interaction between learners and the learning tools. In the context of lifelong learning, the learner model is a user learning pattern, which can be modelled all the time based on user interaction with various sources. The main issue in lifelong learner model design is what type of information needs to be stored in the learner model and how the information granularity is involved. The type and level of information granularity of a user will determine how appropriate the pedagogical policies are to be provided by the system for a user. Lifelong learner model design should be in line with the principles of lifelong learning, namely sociality, interoperability, and scrutability. This paper discusses our research on learner model ontology for lifelong learning. The goal expected to be achieved is that there is a lifelong learner model ontology to be accessed and updated by adaptive learning systems. This research classifies learners' attributes into two groups, which are static and dynamic attributes. Static attributes tend not to change or very rarely change. They include learner's profile, special needs, aptitude, preference, learning approach, learning style, personality, and cognitive capability. On the other hand, dynamic attributes include learning history and study plan. Through conducting some experiments, it can be concluded that LifeOn supports ubiquitous and lifelong learning, and can be used in adaptive learning systems with various learner models.},

  abstract={The trend of mass customization requires highly flexible production systems, which pose a new challenge for workers. Numerous concepts using augmented reality technologies have been developed to offer support in manual assembly processes. Newer AR devices are equipped with more and more functions, such as microphones, speakers or multiple camera systems, which can be used to help workers. However, wearable devices offer only limited computational power and limited flexibility of their interface platform. This poses a challenge to heavy data transactions from various different sources and restrict the use for real-time responses, which are often necessary for applications in a factory. To overcome this limitation, the author of this paper proposes a combination of wearable devices with edge devices located on the shop floor. An augmented reality platform was constructed with modularized services by using the digital twin of the machine components and machine learning algorithms for object recognition. This is integrated in the factory environment to synchronize real machine components with their digital twin.},

Our model use parameters provided by the adopted learner model especially, student knowledge and preferences, and teaching domain model to propose the optimal pedagogical workflow for each learner to reach his didactical objective. This pedagogical process will be adapted during its execution in the workflow engine by using some parameters of student interaction with the system. We aim also to make the evaluation process more fun and non-stressful by introducing pedagogical games in assessment process in order to motivate students to learn and make the learning process a mean to succeed the game.},

  number={},
  pages={48675-48687},
  abstract={Multi-pedestrian tracking (MPT) on the road is closely related to a reduction in the possibility of pedestrian-vehicle collisions when using advanced driver assistance systems. Therefore, this paper focuses on MPT on real roads using a moving camera. Although convolutional neural network (CNN)-based single object tracking methods have recently been proposed, the online learning of CNN for MPT is a significant burden in terms of real-time processing. However, because the features extracted from CNN are a good representation and achieve a high generalization capability, to reduce the learning time, a shallow pre-trained CNN was applied in the present study as a feature extractor instead of an object tracker As an online tracker, this study uses random ferns (RF) with pre-trained CNN output feature, which can make the problem computationally tractable and robustness. However, a large RF requires significant amount of memory and computational complexity, and is still a burden in terms of online learning in cases of multi-pedestrian tracking. Therefore, we introduce a teacher-student model compression algorithm for selecting a few optimal ferns for each tracker, thereby, reducing the online learning time. The online learning of a student-RF tracker has an advantage in that it can adaptively update the tracker to achieve robustness against various changes, such as in pose and illumination, and partial occlusions within a limited period of time. The proposed algorithm was successfully applied to benchmark video sequences captured from a moving camera that include multiple pedestrians in various poses. Specifically, the proposed algorithm yields a more accurate tracking performance than the other state-of-the-art methods.},

Whereas most previous studies of TS training used a frame-level distance between teacher and student models' distributions, we propose using the sequence-level temper-atured Kullback-Leibler divergence as a metric for TS training. In our experiment on the AMI meeting corpus, we prepared a strong teacher model consisting of a convolutional neural network, time delay neural network, and long short-term memory, which had 47.7M parameters and achieved a state-of-the-art word error rate (WER) of 18.05%. Whereas the small student AM (10.8M params. and 19.72% WER) trained by a frame-level TS training was able to fill only 43% of the WER gap between teacher and student AMs, the student AM trained by the proposed method achieved a 18.23% WER, filling 89% of the WER gap from the teacher AM. We also show that the frame-level TS training sometimes even degrades the performance of the student model whereas the proposed method consistently improved the accuracy.},

  pages={5949-5953},
  abstract={The teacher-student (T/S) learning has been shown effective in unsupervised domain adaptation [1]. It is a form of transfer learning, not in terms of the transfer of recognition decisions, but the knowledge of posteriori probabilities in the source domain as evaluated by the teacher model. It learns to handle the speaker and environment variability inherent in and restricted to the speech signal in the target domain without proactively addressing the robustness to other likely conditions. Performance degradation may thus ensue. In this work, we advance T/S learning by proposing adversarial T/S learning to explicitly achieve condition-robust unsupervised domain adaptation. In this method, a student acoustic model and a condition classifier are jointly optimized to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the output distributions of the teacher and student models, and simultaneously, to min-maximize the condition classification loss. A condition-invariant deep feature is learned in the adapted student model through this procedure. We further propose multi-factorial adversarial T/S learning which suppresses condition variabilities caused by multiple factors simultaneously. Evaluated with the noisy CHiME-3 test set, the proposed methods achieve relative word error rate improvements of 44.60% and 5.38%, respectively, over a clean source model and a strong T/S learning baseline model.},

A Markov random field (MRF) is used as prior for the corresponding cluster labels. It promotes a spatial regularization through a Potts-Markov potential and also includes a local potential induced by the classification. Finally, the classification exploits a set of possibly corrupted labeled data provided by the end-user. Model parameters are estimated thanks to a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm.

A learning algorithm is presented to implement DeepSCNs with either specific architecture or self- organization. The read-out weights attached with all direct links from each hidden layer to the output layer are evaluated by the least squares method. Given a set of training examples, DeepSCNs can speedily produce a learning representation, that is, a collection of random basis functions with the cascaded inputs together with the read-out weights.

  abstract={A user model is a collection and categorization of personal data associated with a specific user. With the development of personal computers, the usage of the user model has been evolving in the past 40 years. In the early age of the computer, as a part of computer application, one user model could only be used for a single domain, such as the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the education support. With the increase of many different applications, a user model was separated from its specific computer application to support the cross-domain usage for multiple applications. The emergence of the Internet made the user model to be the users' specific representation on a single social platform for the identification by other users. In the foreseeable future, the user model will become a common representation for its user via multiple social platforms. Theoretically, a unique, digital, comprehensive description of every human individual, namely Cyber Individual (Cyber-I) may exist on the Internet. In this paper, we first focus on approaches to build up the Cyber-I model in comparison to the user model, in terms of model representations, architectures of modeling system and modeling techniques. We then summarize our previous works related to Cyber-I modeling, e.g., the personal data collection, the Cyber-I modeling architecture, and the modeling process. Finally, we present major issues that should be solved for the future development of Cyber-I model and modeling.},

  abstract={User feedback allows for tailoring system operation to ensure individual user satisfaction. A major challenge in personalized decision-making is the systematic construction of a user model during operation while maintaining control performance. This paper presents both an index-based control policy to smartly collect and process user feedback and a user comfort model in the form of a Markov decision process with a priori unknown user-specific state transition probabilities. The control policy utilizes explicit user feedback to optimize a reward measure reflecting user comfort and addresses the explorationexploitation trade-off in a multi-armed bandit framework. The proposed approach combines restless bandits and upper confidence bound algorithms. It introduces an exploration term into the restless bandit formulation, utilizes user feedback to identify the user model, and is shown to be indexable. We demonstrate its capabilities with a simulation for learning a user's trade-off between comfort and energy usage.},

  abstract={Regardless of their industrial or research application, the streamlining of robot operations is limited by the proximity of experienced users to the actual hardware. Be it massive open online robotics courses, crowd-sourcing of robot task training, or remote research on massive robot farms for machine learning, the need to create an apt remote Human-Machine Interface is quite prevalent. The paper at hand proposes a novel solution to the programming/training of remote robots employing an intuitive and accurate user-interface which offers all the benefits of working with real robots without imposing delays and inefficiency. The system includes: a vision-based 3D hand detection and gesture recognition subsystem, a simulated digital twin of a robot as visual feedback, and the “remote” robot learning/executing trajectories using dynamic motion primitives. Our results indicate that the system is a promising solution to the problem of remote training of robot tasks.},

  abstract={The era of "big data" technology has penetrated into all areas of society. In the field of education, personalized teaching has gradually become a new development direction. With the widespread promotion of online education, the adaptive learning system has attracted attention because of its good course recommendation function. As an important part of the general model, the student model reflects the individual characteristics, knowledge status and cognitive ability of the students. The traditional student model judges students based solely on the student’s basic information and simple test scores. This paper proposes a CD-CAT hybrid model based on the actual scene of the learner, retains the original static question bank, and dynamically updates the student model based on the test database of the learner’s different knowledge structure. The knowledge field is divided into multiple categories, and the dynamic allocation of the question bank between categories is carried out. After testing, this dynamic model has a good effect.},

  abstract={Learning management systems (LMS) are widely used in many educational environments. Although usability is widely acknowledged as a desired quality attribute, it has not been deeply investigated in the context of LMS systems where it has to align with pedagogy. In this research we evaluate extensions to an LMS designed to support the implementation of constructive alignment for technical units using a Task-Oriented Portfolio approach. The LMS application was extended with a range of open learner model-based visualisations to help staff and students monitor progress towards achieving unit intended learning outcomes throughout unit delivery. This paper reports on a case study of a formative usability testing of the prototype tool by using User eXperience (UX) metrics. The results unveil the potential usability issues and ways to improve the design of the prototype tool to better cater the actual target user needs.},

  abstract={In the engineering phase of modern manufacturing systems, simulation-based methods and tools have been established to face the increasing demands on time-efficiency and profitability. In the application of these simulation solutions, model-based digital twins are created, as multi-domain simulation models to describe the behavior of the manufacturing system. During the production process, a data-driven digital twin arises in the context of industry 4.0 based on an increasing networking and new cloud technologies. Recent developments in machine learning offer new possibilities in conjunction with the digital twin. These range from data-based learning of models to learning control logic of complex systems. This paper proposes a combined model-based and data-driven concept of a digital twin. It shows how to use machine learning in connection with these models, in order to archive faster development times of manufacturing systems.},

  abstract={This paper studied the recent development and applications of cyber physical system into manufacturing industry. It is observed in literature some models of system design and system development for Industry 4.0 but few were found specifically for manufacturing systems modelling and simulation. This paper proposed a novel system framework of Integrated Cyber Physical Simulation Modelling Environment for Manufacturing 4.0, which incorporated an architecture integrating Aggregate Cyber Space Controller (ACSC) with Physical Space Distributed Controller (PSDC). The concepts of digital twin, distributed artificial intelligence, machine learning, and distributed autonomous control are deployed in the framework with the intention to explore the future potential applications of systems modelling and simulation for manufacturing Industry 4.0 systems. The framework proposed is an extension of Cyber Physical Production System (CPPS) and provides a scenario of hybrid cyber space simulation and physical space discrete controller for manufacturing 4.0.},

  abstract={In this paper, we tackle the region selection task for the purpose of whole slide image (WSI) analysis with a focus on Gram stained slides. Typically, the number of tiles required to capture using high magnification objective is extremely large. Thus, in practice, we need to perform region of interest selection in low magnification objectives to choose only the best candidate regions for the later high magnification analysis. With the fast development of computer vision and deep learning, it is possible to train an accurate convolutional neural network (CNN) based classifier to do this region selection task which would normally be done by experienced scientists and pathologists. However, data collection and labelling during the training stage are very time-consuming, labour intensive and expensive tasks. Researchers starting to ask a much more challenging question: how can we use unlabeled data to boost the system performance? In this paper, to answer this question and to reduce labelling effort, we propose a data distillation training framework to train a CNN classifier on limited labeled data with the help of unlabeled data. The unlabeled data will be carefully selected by a teacher model via a data distillation process and put into the training set for a student model. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework achieves a notable gain in accuracy.},

  abstract={Additive Manufacturing is becoming a strategic initiative to enable the transformation of today's business into a digital enterprise. This technology is increasing the rate of innovation with new lightweight and sustainable designs and dramatically reducing the time from product ideation (design) to realization (manufacturing). Makerspaces are being built all over the world, especially in academic settings and students have 3D printers readily available to design and produce innovative ideas on the spot. The University of Cincinnati (UC) is partnering with Siemens PLM Software to create students who are ready for the digital workforce of the future considering the entire product lifecycle. UC is developing curriculum to teach the fundamentals of Additive Manufacturing using Siemens PLM software as a foundation using a cradle to cradle approach. Students will realize the idea of a `digital thread' that connects a product design to its production environment using fast product/process simulations using a cradle to cradle approach. They will also become aware of simulation tools required for assessing and iterating the performance attributes of the process and the product between the ideation and realization phases to create a `digital twin' of that product. This will help prepare students for Industry 4.0.},

  abstract={Nowadays, more and more people of different ages play digital games. The multimedia, like video, animations, audio and interactive content, that the digital games use, make them more impressive, almost magical. They cause enthusiasm and pleasant feelings to users-players. Therefore, they can be used to motivate students to participate in learning processes. That is the reason why educational digital games has become a burning issue. However, some users-players deal with difficulties during the game playing. For example, they may have difficulties in solving a puzzle, crossing a labyrinth, finding a hidden object, or defeating in a battle etc. As a result, they are disappointed and are drawn away from the game's educational goal. Therefore, in the presented paper, a stereotype-based user model, which identifies the abilities and difficulties that a particular user-player has during the game playing, is presented. A user model is able to highlight the user's individual needs and specific characteristics in order to offer personalization. The presented user model provides the game the ability to be adapted to each particular player's needs and abilities, making the playing process more fascinating and allowing the player to focus on the learning process and the educational goal. Furthermore, the paper presents examples of operation. Also, the system has been evaluated and the evaluation results are very encouraging.},

  abstract={Nowadays, intelligent and expert systems and applications have become a burning issue. In the scientific literature, it seems to be of particular interest to provide educational applications and systems with “intelligence”, in order to be able to adapt either the learning material or the tutoring and learning processes to each individual student's needs. The module of student model is crucial for offering a personalized learning experience to each particular student. Student modeling has been introduced in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), but it's use has been extended to most current educational software applications that aim to be adaptive and personalized. Student modeling is able to highlight students individual needs, learning characteristics, knowledge level, errors or misconceptions etc. However, building a student model is a complex process. In this paper, a novel web service API, which creates platform-independent and technological-independent student models using the technology of web services, is presented. The presented API is called FSP Creator. Its innovative operation relies on the facts that the created student profile i) can be embedded in any educational application (web, mobile, game), regardless of the system's technological characteristics or programming language, ii) can be recognized by all the different applications that use it and call the same web services. Furthermore, the created student profile is based on fuzzy logic sets that are used by a Fuzzy Rule System incorporated in FSP Creator and used for selecting the appropriate learning material and exercises. However, each application that uses the created student profile can extend the fuzzy rule set or use its own fuzzy rule set as desired. For the description of the operations of FSP Creator, we have used three different educational applications (two games and one web-based educational application) that have used the fuzzy student profile, which has been created by the presented API.},

Symbiotic simulation is designed to support decision making at the operational levels by making use of real- or near real- time data that is generated by the physical system, which is used as an input to the simulation model. From the modeling perspective, a symbiotic simulation system comprises a hybrid systems model that combines simulation, optimization and machine learning models as well as a data acquisition module and an actuator. The actuator is needed when the symbiotic simulation system is designed to directly control the physical system without human intervention. This paper reviews the components of a symbiotic simulation system from the perspective of hybrid systems modeling and highlights research questions needed to advance symbiotic simulation study.},

  abstract={Non-native speech causes automatic speech recognition systems to degrade in performance. Past strategies to address this challenge have considered model adaptation, accent classification with a model selection, alternate pronunciation lexicon, etc. In this study, we consider a recurrent neural network (RNN) with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) cost function trained on multi-accent English data including US (Native), Indian and Hispanic accents. We exploit dark knowledge from a model trained with the multi-accent data to train student models under the guidance of both a teacher model and CTC cost of target transcription. We show that transferring knowledge from a single RNN-CTC trained model toward a student model, yields better performance than the stand-alone teacher model. Since the outputs of different trained CTC models are not necessarily aligned, it is not possible to simply use an ensemble of CTC teacher models. To address this problem, we train accent specific models under the guidance of a single multi-accent teacher, which results in having multiple aligned and trained CTC models. Furthermore, we train a student model under the supervision of the accent-specific teachers, resulting in an even further complementary model, which achieves +20.1% relative Character Error Rate (CER) reduction compared to the baseline trained without any teacher. Having this effective multi-accent model, we can achieve further improvement for each accent by adapting the model to each accent. Using the accent specific model's outputs to regularize the adapting process (i.e., a knowledge distillation version of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence) results in even superior performance compared to the conventional approach using general teacher models.},

  pages={1-13},
  abstract={Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is accompanied by a variety of technologies which offer great potential for optimizing the manufacturing of electric motors. However, the application of I4.0 technologies in this sector has hardly been examined yet. For determining I4.0 potentials in the electric motor production, a structured approach is required since the variety of sub-processes and production technologies results in a vast number of possible combinations. Therefore, this paper first compares different generic approaches for identifying, selecting and implementing I4.0 use cases. Building on this, a methodical approach is derived in order to tap the numerous I4.0 potentials within the electric motor production. On the one hand, use cases can be derived from current technological opportunities resulting from application examples and best practices in research and industry. On the other hand, concrete problems in critical manufacturing processes can give rise to the application of novel I4.0 solutions. By presenting a comprehensive overview of promising application scenarios, this paper mainly facilitates the identification of I4.0 potentials in the electric motor production from an opportunity-driven perspective. In addition to approaches directly addressing the electric motor production, concepts can be derived from related processes in other application domains. Examples are provided by outlining a selection of the presumably most relevant use cases. The results indicate that especially data-driven approaches, i.e. data analytics and machine learning, offer great potential in electric motor production. As an outlook, I4.0 potentials can also be disclosed from a problem-pull perspective, supplementing the opportunity-push approach of this paper.},

Activities and teaching materials in robotic environments are the same for all students, and may end up being insufficient for the effective learning of each one.

Here, the Digital Twin demonstrator is presented as a method for the design and implementation of privacy enhancement mechanisms, and is used to detect privacy concerns and minimize breaches and associated risks to which smart car drivers can be exposed through connected infotainment applications and services. The Digital Twin-based privacy enhancement demonstrator is designed to simulate variety of conditions that can occur in the smart car ecosystem. We firstly identify the core stakeholders (actors) in the smart car ecosystem, their roles and exposure to privacy vulnerabilities and associated risks. Secondly, we identify assets that consume and generate sensitive privacy data in smart cars, their functionalities, and relevant privacy concerns and risks. Thirdly, we design an infrastructure for collecting (i) real-time sensor data from smart cars and their assets, and (ii) environmental data, road and traffic data, generated through operational driving lifecycle. In order to ensure compliance of the collected data with privacy policies and regulations, e.g. with GDPR requirements for enforcement of the data subject's rights, we design methods for the Digital Twin-based privacy enhancement demonstrator that are based on behavioural analytics informed by GDPR. We also perform data anonymization to minimize privacy risks and enable actions such as sending an automatic informed consent to the stakeholders.},

The independence of characteristic models enables the system to be modular, with each module estimating one characteristic. The proposed model is iterative, fusing new observations, and measurements with previous information in a process regulated entropy. The system allows diverse implementations, such as the combination of multiple robots with a cloud infrastructure or distributed ambient sensors. This paper aims to enable the system to perform online learning while interacting with users. The system is also able to obtain a correct user representation from heterogeneous information, even when some user characteristics cannot be computed. To demonstrate its functionality, the system is tested on two experimental datasets, obtained from simulated experiments and with real users. This technique advances the state of the art in the areas of AAL and user-adaptive systems, and in cloud-connected robots and Internet of Things, allowing for these heterogeneous and naturally distributed teams of devices to better model their users, potentially achieving higher interaction autonomy.},

  abstract={Digital twin is a significant way to achieve smart manufacturing, and provides a new paradigm for fault diagnosis. Traditional data-based fault diagnosis methods mostly assume that the training data and test data are following the same distribution and can acquire sufficient data to train a reliable diagnosis model, which is unrealistic in the dynamic changing production process. In this paper, we present a two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method using deep transfer learning (DFDD), which realizes fault diagnosis both in the development and maintenance phases. At first, the potential problems that are not considered at design time can be discovered through front running the ultra-high-fidelity model in the virtual space, while a deep neural network (DNN)-based diagnosis model will be fully trained. In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as avoids wasting time and knowledge. A case study about fault diagnosis using DFDD in a car body-side production line is presented. The results show the superiority and feasibility of our proposed method.},

  abstract={Specifying complex task behaviors while ensuring good robot performance may be difficult for untrained users. We study a framework for users to specify rules for acceptable behavior in a shared environment such as industrial facilities. As non-expert users might have little intuition about how their specification impacts the robot's performance, we design a learning system that interacts with users to find an optimal solution. Using active preference learning, we iteratively show alternative paths that the robot could take on an interface. From the user feedback on ranking the alternatives, we learn about the weights that users place on each part of their specification. We extend the user model from our previous work to a discrete Bayesian learning model and introduce a greedy algorithm for proposing alternative that operates on the notion of equivalence regions of user weights. We prove that using this algorithm, the revision active learning process converges on the user-optimal path. Using simulations performed in realistic industrial environments, we demonstrate the convergence and robustness of our approach.},

  pages={50081-50094},
  abstract={Privacy protection is considered as an important problem in learning-based systems. Recently, various works based on differential privacy have been proposed to protect an individual's privacy in the machine learning and deep learning contexts. One of the state-of-the-art approaches is Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE), a generic framework which can be successfully applied to many different learning algorithms. In PATE, we need to split the private dataset into many disjoint subsets and train an ensemble of teachers on these subsets. Then, we transfer noisy predictions from the ensemble of teachers to a student model. In this paper, we show that for complex datasets and tasks, such as nature image classification, the training set allocated for one teacher may be too small with respect to the corresponding task to achieve an ideal performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose the TrPATE framework which extends PATE with transfer learning. Based on PATE, we transfer and share the knowledge extracted from a publicly available non-private dataset to the teachers. The extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets, and the empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract={Short utterance-based spoken language identification (LID) is a challenging task due to the large variation of its feature representation. Improving feature representation of short utterances using a teacher-student method has been shown its effectiveness for LID tasks. However, conventional teacher-student methods use fixed pre-trained teacher models, that makes it difficult to optimize student models. In this paper, rather than using a fixed pre-trained teacher model, we investigate an interactive teacher-student learning by adjusting the teacher model with reference to the performance of the student model when the student model is stuck in a local minimum. Experiments on a 10-language LID task were carried out to test the algorithm. Our results showed its effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on short utterance LID tasks.},

  abstract={For real-world speech recognition applications, noise robustness is still a challenge. In this work, we adopt the teacher-student (T/S) learning technique using a parallel clean and noisy corpus for improving automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance under multimedia noise. On top of that, we apply a logits selection method which only preserves the k highest values to prevent wrong emphasis of knowledge from the teacher and to reduce bandwidth needed for transferring data. We incorporate up to 8000 hours of untranscribed data for training and present our results on sequence trained models apart from cross entropy trained ones. The best sequence trained student model yields relative word error rate (WER) reductions of approximately 10.1%, 28.7% and 19.6% on our clean, simulated noisy and real test sets respectively comparing to a sequence trained teacher.},

  abstract={Deep speaker embedding learning is an effective method for speaker identity modelling. Very deep models such as ResNet can achieve remarkable results but are usually too computationally expensive for real applications with limited resources. On the other hand, simply reducing model size is likely to result in significant performance degradation. In this paper, label-level and embedding-level knowledge distillation are proposed to narrow down the performance gap between large and small models. Label-level distillation utilizes the posteriors obtained by a well-trained teacher model to guide the optimization of the student model, while embedding-level distillation directly constrains the similarity between embeddings learned by two models. Experiments were carried out on the VoxCeleb1 dataset. Results show that the proposed knowledge distillation methods can significantly boost the performance of highly compact student models.},

  pages={2202-2206},
  abstract={Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have seen great progress in classifying images. Action recognition is different from still image classification; video data contains temporal information that plays an important role in video understanding. Currently, most CNN-based approaches for action recognition have excessive computational costs, with an explosion of parameters and computation time. The currently most efficient method trains a deep network directly on compressed video containing the motion information. However, this method has a large number of parameters. We propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework for compressed video action recognition to compress this model. With this framework, the model is compressed by transferring the knowledge from multiple teachers to a single small student model. With multi-teacher knowledge distillation, students learn better than with single-teacher knowledge distillation. Experiments show that we can reach a 2.4× compression rate in a number of parameters and a 1.2× computation reduction with 1.79% loss of accuracy on the UCF-101 dataset and 0.35% loss of accuracy on the HMDB51 dataset.},

  abstract={This paper presents our work of training acoustic event detection (AED) models using unlabeled dataset. Recent acoustic event detectors are based on large-scale neural networks, which are typically trained with huge amounts of labeled data. Labels for acoustic events are expensive to obtain, and relevant acoustic event audios can be limited, especially for rare events. In this paper we leverage an Internet-scale un-labeled dataset with potential domain shift to improve the detection of acoustic events. Based on the classic tri-training approach, our proposed method shows accuracy improvement over both the supervised training baseline, and semi-supervised self-training set-up, in all pre-defined acoustic event detection tasks. As our approach relies on ensemble models, we further show the improvements can be distilled to a single model via knowledge distillation, with the resulting single student model maintaining high accuracy of teacher ensemble models.},

  volume={},

  pages={6445-6449},
  abstract={The teacher-student (T/S) learning has been shown to be effective for a variety of problems such as domain adaptation and model compression. One shortcoming of the T/S learning is that a teacher model, not always perfect, sporadically produces wrong guidance in form of posterior probabilities that misleads the student model towards a suboptimal performance. To overcome this problem, we propose a conditional T/S learning scheme, in which a "smart" student model selectively chooses to learn from either the teacher model or the ground truth labels conditioned on whether the teacher can correctly predict the ground truth. Unlike a naive linear combination of the two knowledge sources, the conditional learning is exclusively engaged with the teacher model when the teacher model's prediction is correct, and otherwise backs off to the ground truth. Thus, the student model is able to learn effectively from the teacher and even potentially surpass the teacher. We examine the proposed learning scheme on two tasks: domain adaptation on CHiME-3 dataset and speaker adaptation on Microsoft short message dictation dataset. The proposed method achieves 9.8% and 12.8% relative word error rate reductions, respectively, over T/S learning for environment adaptation and speaker-independent model for speaker adaptation.},

Learning an AM from 1 Million hours of audio presents unique ML and system design challenges. We present the design and evaluation of a highly scalable and resource efficient SSL system for AM. Employing the student/teacher learning paradigm, we focus on the student learning subsystem: a scalable and robust data pipeline that generates features and targets from raw audio, and an efficient model pipeline, including the distributed trainer, that builds a student model. Our evaluations show that, even without extensive hyper-parameter tuning, we obtain relative accuracy improvements in the 10 to 20% range, with higher gains in noisier conditions. The end-toend processing time of this SSL system was 12 days, and several components in this system can trivially scale linearly with more compute resources.},

Support Vector Machines (SVM) are supervised learning models for classification analysis in machine learning. Given a set of training FRA examples with known winding categories, an SVM algorithm is built to assign new FRA traces to a most possible winding category. A group of 400/275 kV transformers are tested in this study with excellent classification results of winding types, indicating a promising “digital twin” technological approach to transformer asset management.},

CTR of a result has two core components: (a) the probability of examination of a result by a user, and (b) the perceived relevance of the result given that it has been examined by the user. There has been considerable work on user browsing models, to model and analyze both the examination and the relevance components of CTR. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation: a micro-browsing model for how users read result snippets. The snippet text of a result often plays a critical role in the perceived relevance of the result. We study how particular words within a line of snippet can influence user behavior. We validate this new micro-browsing user model by considering the problem of predicting which snippet will yield higher CTR, and show that classification accuracy is dramatically higher with our micro-browsing user model. The key insight in this paper is that varying relatively few words within a snippet, and even their location within a snippet, can have a significant influence on the clickthrough of a snippet.},

  abstract={This study implements deep learning techniques to estimate fuel burn of a jet aircraft. Current ground-based flight planning systems utilize aircraft type specific performance tables to determine fuel flows for given flight conditions and parameters such as altitude, mass and speed. These tables are corrected by a performance factor as the aircraft ages. Despite this update, planned fuel consumption may indeed not overlap with the actual one. In order to synchronize the base aircraft model with aircraft's actual performance, we propose using state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for building data-driven models of fuel flows. Towards this goal, aircraft's on-board recorded trajectory and parameter data, namely Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data are utilized. The total dataset used within this study comprises of more than 1000 B777-300ER flights from a major European flag carrier airline. The deep neural network architecture is utilized for modeling the actual fuel flow specific to each aircraft and for each major flight mode (climb, cruise and descent namely). We have developed three neural network architectures (according to in-flight and ground based planning use cases) to present a tail-number specific correction factor to Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) models. First architecture involves a QAR data based black-box fuel flow model utilizing in-flight throttle data from all the engines. Comparison of this model with real flight data shows that precise estimation of fuel flow with mean errors lower than %0.1 can be achieved. The second architecture utilizes a physically consistent data regeneration of δT (delta thrust) using BADA formulation as to account for the ground planning phase where throttle information is not available. The third model involves a cascaded architecture which utilizes a neural network throttle estimator and the black-box QAR fuel flow model for again the ground planning phase. Comparison of the latter models with real flight data shows that precise estimation of fuel flow with mean absolute errors lower than %0.7 can be achieved at all the flight modes. Initial tests reflect the fact that even better accuracy can be achieved for all models as the data set size increases. Finally, ground based planning fuel flow models are applied to actual flight plans generated by ground based systems. Total trip fuel comparisons show discrepancies up to %3.5 total fuel loading weight, which may result in potential fuel savings by decreasing the fuel load during take-off. Comparison of the planned and the estimated fuel boarding weights (following the actual filed flight plans) for 91 long-haul flights show that fuel burn savings of around 800 [k g] per flight could have been achieved by the proposed methodology at the ground planning phase. For a typical operation of 100 long-haul flights per day, this represents yearly savings on the order of around 17 million USD at current jet fuel prices. This “tail-number specific” performance modeling approach is projected to open considerable frontiers including the in-flight update of performance models through machine learning methods.},

  abstract={Estimation of user perceived quality of offered services, from massive number of Key Performance Indicator (KPI)'s that are measured in diverse components, has been a necessity for mobile network operators. The goal is first to have a good estimator for poor Quality of Experience (QoE), which can potentially be achieved with machine learning, and then pinpoint the features that are contributing to the poor performance. There is often a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability of models. In this paper, we address this tradeoff by first developing a robust but complex teacher machine learning model to map the subjective Net Promoter Score (NPS) values computed from the user quality feedback to the underlying subset of KPI metrics. Next, we develop a rather interpretable student model supervised by the pre-trained teacher model. Eventually the compact student decision tree model learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher model with an at least 10 % improved accuracy in testset as compared to conventional way of directly training using the decision tree model. In the last step, we extract the rules and important influential features of the distilled student model.},

To address this issue, we introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) learning paradigm, to transfer the user characteristics into the weights of student neural networks that just utilize product and review information. The teacher model transfers its predictive distributions of training data to the student model. Thus, the user profiles are only required during the training stage. Experimental results on several sentiment classification datasets show that the proposed learning framework enables student models to achieve improved performance.},

  abstract={In this paper, we consider a mobile edge computing system with both ultra-reliable and low-latency communications services and delay tolerant services. We aim to minimize the normalized energy consumption, defined as the energy consumption per bit, by optimizing user association, resource allocation, and offloading probabilities subject to the quality-of-service requirements. The user association is managed by the mobility management entity (MME), while resource allocation and offloading probabilities are determined by each access point (AP). We propose a deep learning (DL) architecture, where a digital twin of the real network environment is used to train the DL algorithm off-line at a central server. From the pre-trained deep neural network (DNN), the MME can obtain user association scheme in a real-time manner. Considering that the real networks are not static, the digital twin monitors the variation of real networks and updates the DNN accordingly. For a given user association scheme, we propose an optimization algorithm to find the optimal resource allocation and offloading probabilities at each AP. The simulation results show that our method can achieve lower normalized energy consumption with less computation complexity compared with an existing method and approach to the performance of the global optimal solution.},

Research has shown that adaptive e-learning improves the effectiveness of e-learning systems and removes the loneliness experienced by learners when they are online. Though this is the case, adaptive e-learning systems face the challenge of not only utilizing one learner characteristic to provide adaptation but also the problem of deciding which learner characteristic to model. This study was carried out in order to develop a learner model based on learning theories since learning theories do spell out on how learning occurs and therefore useful in determining which learner characteristic to model. Systematic literature review on articles dealing with adaptive e-learning was carried out. Articles were extracted from various databases and were selected using a three step process. 16 articles were selected for the final analysis. The results of the analysis indicate that, there is evidence of basing adaptive e-learning systems on learning theories and the most utilized theory is cognitivism. The learner characteristic that is majorly modelled is learning style. In order to capture different learner characteristics we propose a learner model based on the three major learning theories; constructivism, cognitivism and behaviriousim.},

  abstract={In automatic speech recognition, performance gains can often be obtained by combining an ensemble of multiple models. However, this can be computationally expensive when performing recognition. Teacher-student learning alleviates this cost by training a single student model to emulate the combined ensemble behaviour. Only this student needs to be used for recognition. Previously investigated teacher-student criteria often limit the forms of diversity allowed in the ensemble, and only propagate information from the teachers to the student at the frame level. This paper addresses both of these issues by examining teacher-student learning within a sequence-level framework, and assessing the flexibility that these approaches offer. Various sequence-level teacher-student criteria are examined in this work, to propagate sequence posterior information. A training criterion based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence between context-dependent state sequence posteriors is proposed that allows for a diversity of state cluster sets to be present in the ensemble. This criterion is shown to be an upper bound to a more general KL-divergence between word sequence posteriors, which places even fewer restrictions on the ensemble diversity, but whose gradient can be expensive to compute. These methods are evaluated on the augmented multi-party interaction (AMI) meeting transcription and MGB-3 television broadcast audio tasks.},

  pages={107744-107756},
  abstract={Customer services are critical to all companies, as they may directly connect to the brand reputation. Due to a great number of customers, e-commerce companies often employ multiple communication channels to answer customers' questions, for example, Chatbot and Hotline. On one hand, each channel has limited capacity to respond to customers' requests; on the other hand, customers have different preferences over these channels. The current production systems are mainly built based on business rules that merely consider the tradeoffs between the resources and customers' satisfaction. To achieve the optimal tradeoff between the resources and customers' satisfaction, we propose a new framework based on deep reinforcement learning that directly takes both resources and user model into account. In addition to the framework, we also propose a new deep-reinforcement-learning-based routing method-double dueling deep Q-learning with prioritized experience replay (PER-DoDDQN). We evaluate our proposed framework and method using both synthetic and a real customer service log data from a large financial technology company. We show that our proposed deep-reinforcement-learning-based framework is superior to the existing production system. Moreover, we also show that our proposed PER-DoDDQN is better than all other deep Q-learning variants in practice, which provides a more optimal routing plan. These observations suggest that our proposed method can seek the tradeoff, where both channel resources and customers' satisfaction are optimal.},

  abstract={As 5G high-speed mobile communications developing rapidly, services and contents that people get from the Internet have been enriched significantly, which necessitates the user equipment (UE) to have least power consumption, reduced latency, enhanced lifetime and better QoS. However, the tail energy of LTE interface on UE leads to low energy efficiency which is caused by applying fixed Radio Resource Control (RRC) inactivity timer. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to eliminate the tail whenever possible and improve the user equipment power efficiency. We design a self-adaptive tool to optimize the LTE RRC inactivity timer for individual users based on user model. Firstly, The tool collects runtime network information from cellular networks and uses machine learning method to predict the session length. Then it adjusts inactivity timer dynamically based on the predicted session length. In addition, we propose an enhanced RRC protocol to support our proposed tool. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our energy-saving tool, we applied it on commercial off-the-shelf phones. Simulation results show the proposed tool can reduce the energy consumption of smart-phone by 27-33.5%.},

In this paper, we propose a Style Aggregated and Attention Transfer framework (SA-AT) based on ResNet for cross-database Micro-Expression Recognition (MER). The training of SA-AT has two stages. In the first stage, facial expression samples are used as the auxiliary database to train a ResNet teacher model. To benefit from the significant classification ability of teacher model which is trained on large scale data, in the second step, the attention of the teacher model is transferred to train the student model on style aggregated micro-expression databases with limited samples. Our experiments demonstrate that compared with the baseline method in Micro-Expression Grand Challenge 2019, our proposed technique achieves more promising performance.},

  abstract={It remains very challenging to build a pedestrian detection system for real world applications, which demand for both accuracy and speed. This work presents a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework to learn a lightweight pedestrian detector, which significantly reduces the computational cost and still holds the high accuracy at the same time. Following the `teacher-student' diagram that a stronger, deeper neural network can teach a lightweight network to learn better representations, we explore multiple knowledge distillation architectures and reframe this approach as a unified, hierarchical distillation framework. In particular, the proposed distillation is performed at multiple hierarchies, multiple stages in a modern detector, which empowers the student detector to learn both low-level details and high-level abstractions simultaneously. Experiment result shows that a student model trained by our framework, with 6 times compression in number of parameters, still achieves competitive performance as the teacher model on the widely used pedestrian detection benchmark.},

  year={2019},
  volume={27},
  number={12},
  pages={2080-2091},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student learning framework for the preprocessing of a speech recognizer, leveraging the online noise tracking capabilities of improved minima controlled recursive averaging (IMCRA) and deep learning of nonlinear interactions between speech and noise. First, a teacher model with deep architectures is built to learn the target of ideal ratio masks (IRMs) using simulated training pairs of clean and noisy speech data. Next, a student model is trained to learn an improved speech presence probability by incorporating the estimated IRMs from the teacher model into the IMCRA approach. The student model can be compactly designed in a causal processing mode having no latency with the guidance of a complex and noncausal teacher model. Moreover, the clean speech requirement, which is difficult to meet in real-world adverse environments, can be relaxed for training the student model, implying that noisy speech data can be directly used to adapt the regression-based enhancement model to further improve speech recognition accuracies for noisy speech collected in such conditions. Experiments on the CHiME-4 challenge task show that our best student model with bidirectional gated recurrent units (BGRUs) can achieve a relative word error rate (WER) reduction of 18.85% for the real test set when compared to unprocessed system without acoustic model retraining. However, the traditional teacher model degrades the performance of the unprocessed system in this case. In addition, the student model with a deep neural network (DNN) in causal mode having no latency yields a relative WER reduction of 7.94% over the unprocessed system with 670 times less computing cycles when compared to the BGRU-equipped student model. Finally, the conventional speech enhancement and IRM-based deep learning method destroyed the ASR performance when the recognition system became more powerful. While our proposed approach could still improve the ASR performance even in the more powerful recognition system.},

  abstract={Additive manufacturing (AM) assisted by a digital twin is expected to revolutionize the realization of high-value and high-complexity functional parts on a global scale. Machine learning (ML) introduced in digitized AM provides potential to transform AM data into knowledge continuously and automatically; hence AM products will be designed and manufactured with improved quality. Conventional product development systems, however, fail to fully adopt ML algorithms on the increasingly available AM data for knowledge acquisition. To address the limitation, this paper proposes an algorithmic framework for constructing AM knowledge automatically and continuously from data. The proposed algorithm develops predictive models to correlate process parameters with part structure and properties using ML algorithms on design, process control, in-situ monitoring, and ex-situ measurement AM data. Based on the predictive models, the algorithm constructs prescriptive rules necessary for decision-making in AM product developments. The constructed rule knowledge is stored in a knowledge base by the algorithm for further AM knowledge query and constructions. Then, the algorithm provides feedback to a knowledge-query formulation phase, which forms the algorithm into a closed loop. Through the algorithm, AM knowledge can self-evolve continuously, while reflecting dynamically generated AM data in an automated and autonomous manner. A case study is presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm and a software prototype is developed to demonstrate the algorithm capability.},

In this paper, the early identification of students who are at risk of withdrew and failure is provided. Therefore, two models are constructed namely at-risk student model and learning achievement model. The models have the potential to detect the students who are in danger of failing and withdrawal at the early stage of the online course. The result reveals that all classifiers gain good accuracy across both models, the highest performance yield by GBM with the value of 0.894, 0.952 for first, second model respectively, while RF yield the value of 0.866, in at-risk student framework achieved the lowest accuracy.

  abstract={Synthetic data generation has recently emerged as a substitution technique for handling the problem of bulk data needed in training machine learning algorithms. Healthcare, primarily cardiovascular domain is a major area where synthetic physiological data like Photoplethysmogram (PPG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Phonocardiogram (PCG), etc. are being used to improve accuracy of machine learning algorithm. Conventional synthetic data generation approach using mathematical formulations lack interpretability. Hence, aim of this paper is to generate synthetic PPG signal from a Digital twin platform replicating cardiovascular system. Such system can serve the dual purpose of replicating the physical system, so as to simulate specific `what if' scenarios as well as to generate large scale synthetic data with patho-physiological interpretability. Cardio-vascular Digital twin is modeled with a two chambered heart, haemodynamic equations and a baroreflex based pressure control mechanism to generate blood pressure and flow variations. Synthetic PPG signal is generated from the model for healthy and Atherosclerosis condition. Initial validation of the platform has been made on the basis of efficiency of the platform in clustering Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and non CAD PPG data by extracting features from the synthetically generated PPG and comparing that with PPG obtained from Physionet data.},

  abstract={Person re-identification (Re-ID), which is for matching pedestrians across disjoint camera views in surveillance, has made great progress in supervised learning. However, requirement of a large number of labelled identities leads to high cost for large-scale Re-ID systems. Consequently, it is significant to study learning Re-ID with unlabelled data and limited labelled data, that is, semi-supervised person re-identification. When labelled data is limited, the learned model tends to overfit the data and cannot generalize well. Moreover, the scene variations between cameras lead to domain shift in the feature space, which makes mining auxiliary supervision information from unlabelled data more difficult. To address these problems, we propose a Distilled Camera-Aware Self Training framework for semi-supervised person re-identification. To alleviate the overfitting problem for learning from limited labelled data, we propose a Multi-Teacher Selective Similarity Distillation Loss to selectively aggregate the knowledge of multiple weak teacher models trained with different subsets and distill a stronger student model. Then, we exploit the unlabelled data by learning pseudo labels by clustering based on the student model for self training. To alleviate the effect of scene variations between cameras, we propose a Camera-Aware Hierarchical Clustering (CAHC) algorithm to perform intra-camera clustering and cross-camera clustering hierarchically. Experiments show that our method outperformed the state-of-the-art semi-supervised person re-identification methods.},

From the instructor perspective, it can scale grading in large classes, track students' progress, reduce the grading burden and provide an estimation of the final course grade. The existing peer assessment platforms generally offer limited support for the teacher; many of them are based on a predefined peer assessment scenario and the instructor does not have the opportunity to conFigure the workflow, review allocation or grade computing mechanisms. In this context, we propose a peer assessment system, called LearnEval, which provides comprehensive instructor support: creation and editing of assignments, detailed monitoring of student activity, including various scores and statistics, learner model visualization; in addition, the teacher can conFigure the scenario and scores in order to fit the needs of the course. The paper describes the LearnEval instructor module in terms of functionalities, implementation, as well as a pilot study in the context of a Multimedia Technologies in E-Learning project.},

  abstract={Advanced manufacturing that is adaptable to constantly changing product designs often requires dynamic changes on the factory floor to enable manufacture. The integration of robotic manufacture with machine learning approaches offers the possibility to enable such dynamic changes on the factory floor. While ensuring safety and the possibility of losses of components and waste of material are against their usage. Furthermore, developments in design of virtual environments makes it possible to perform simulations in a virtual environment, to enable human-in-the-loop production of parts correctly the first time like never before. Such powerful simulation and control software provides the means to design a digital twin of manufacturing environment in which trials are completed at almost at no cost. In this paper, ant colony optimization is used to program an industrial robot to avoid obstacles and find its way to pick and place objects during an assembly task in an environment containing obstacles that must be avoided. The optimization is completed in a digital twin environment first and movements transferred to the real robot after human inspection. It is shown that the proposed methodology can find the optimal solution, in addition to avoiding collisions, for an assembly task with minimum human intervention.},

  abstract={To make efficient use of limited spectral resources, we in this work propose a deep actor-critic reinforcement learning based framework for dynamic multichannel access. We consider both a single-user case and a scenario in which multiple users attempt to access channels simultaneously. We employ the proposed framework as a single agent in the single-user case, and extend it to a decentralized multi-agent framework in the multi-user scenario. In both cases, we develop algorithms for the actor-critic deep reinforcement learning and evaluate the proposed learning policies via experiments and numerical results. In the single-user model, in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed channel access policy and the framework's tolerance against uncertainty, we explore different channel switching patterns and different switching probabilities. In the case of multiple users, we analyze the probabilities of each user accessing channels with favorable channel conditions and the probability of collision. We also address a time-varying environment to identify the adaptive ability of the proposed framework. Additionally, we provide comparisons (in terms of both the average reward and time efficiency) between the proposed actor-critic deep reinforcement learning framework, Deep-Q network (DQN) based approach, random access, and the optimal policy when the channel dynamics are known.},

  abstract={When, in 1956, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was officially declared a research field, no one would have ever predicted the huge influence and impact its description, prediction, and prescription capabilities were going to have on our daily lives. In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed. The design implications derived from the study are then presented: they focus on socio-technical design aspects and DT lifecycle. Open issues and challenges that require to be addressed in the future are finally discussed.},

  abstract={Achieving multiplication table fluency is a major concern during all primary school years and for many pupils it is considered a challenge. `Rote memory' approaches that have been deployed for years in the traditional school curriculum have contributed to the prevailing assumption of pupils that Mathematics is unpleasant and uninviting. This paper presents a game-based approach to assess and gradually improve multiplication skills by combining an adaptive mechanism for identifying and resolving pupil weaknesses, while exposing parts of the learner model to the user through easily perceivable visualizations. Moreover, the game offers social comparison information and pupils can access progress data about their peers or their entire class a feature that is expected to improve self-reflection, allow for self-regulated learning and increase user motivation. This paper also presents the feedback received by the preliminary testing of the game with a representative sample of pupils and discusses the effect of allowing access to the progress of peers and summative class scores.},

  abstract={One of the key issues of multi-sensory digital healthcare and therapy is the reliability and user compliance of the applied sensor system. In the context of digital gait analysis and rehabilitation, different technologies have been proposed allowing objective gait assessment and precise quantification of the rehabilitation progress using Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) platforms. However, this depends largely on the estimation accuracy of the kinematics (body joint angles). This paper presents the concept of a digital equivalent based on the Memory Polynomial Model (MPM) to reduce the number of IMUs needed for the measurements and to simulate the physical mechanism of lower body joint angles based on acceleration data. The MPM parameter estimation is based on the Least Square (LS) approach and is performed using accelerometer records of non-pathological gait patterns. The Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) is used to evaluate the performance of the model. According to the results an NMSE of -20 dB is achieved, which indicates the great potential of applying the MPM to develop a digital twin. That kind of twin can serve as a prototype of the physical counterpart to improve the wearability of the sensor system and to reduce physically induced measurement errors as well.},

  abstract={Over the past few years, deep learning (DL) based electricity demand forecasting has received considerable attention amongst mathematicians, engineers and data scientists working within the smart grid domain. To this end, deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks (DNN), deep belief networks (DBN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been successfully applied to forecast the generation and consumption of a wide range of energy vectors. In this work, we show preliminary results for a residential load demand forecasting solution which is realized within the framework of power grid digital twin. To this end, a novel class of deep neural networks is adopted wherein the output of the network is efficiently computed via a black-box ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. We introduce the readers to the main concepts behind this method followed by a real-world, data driven computational benchmark test case designed to study the numerical effectiveness of the proposed approach. Initial results suggest that the ODE based solutions yield acceptable levels of accuracy for wide range of prediction horizons. We conclude that the method could prove as a valuable tool to develop forecasting models within an electrical digital twin (EDT) framework, where, in addition to accurate prediction models, a time horizon independent, computationally scalable and compact model is often desired.},

Unlike techniques such as PWM switch, state-space averaging, etc., this approach uses data from simulations or hardware experiments to develop the system model. The different steps involved in this modeling process are: (i) using an existing simulation or hardware prototype of the converter, collect data of different system parameters such as time, inductance, capacitance, resistance, voltages, currents, etc., (ii) categorize these parameters into inputs and outputs of the model, (iii) use BR-ANN to model transient performance and RF with bootstrap aggregation to model steady state response, (iv) validate the models with training and testing data sets, and (v) use the model to test with new values of input parameters. The proposed methodologies are tested using conventional buck and boost converters for proof of concept. It is envisioned that this technique can be used to create digital twins of power converters in practical circuits, optimize performance and predict fault conditions.},

  abstract={Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) aims to support Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) by monitoring, diagnosing, and prognosing the health of the host system. One of the technologies required by IVHM to carry out its objectives is the means to emulate the functioning of the host system, and the concept of a Digital Twin (DT) was introduced in aerospace IVHM to represent the functioning of such a complex system. This paper aims to discuss the role played by DT in the field of IVHM. A DT is the virtual representation of any physical product, that is used to project the functioning of the product at a given instance. The DT is used across the lifecycle of any product, and its output can be customized depending upon the area of application. The DT is currently popular in industry because of the technologies like sensors, cloud computing, Internet of Things, machine learning, and advanced software, which enabled its development. This paper discusses what encompasses a DT, the technologies that support the DT, its applications across industries, and its development in academia. This paper also talks about how a DT can combine with IVHM technology to assess the health of complex systems like an aircraft. Lastly, this paper presents various challenges faced by industry during the implementation of a DT and some of the possible opportunities for future growth.},

  abstract={Low-resolution face recognition in the wild still is an open problem. In this paper, we propose to address this problem via a novel learning approach called Mixed-Domain Distillation (MDD). The approach applies a teacher-student framework to mix and distill knowledge from four different domain datasets, including private high-resolution, public high-resolution, public low-resolution web and target low-resolution wild face datasets. In this way, high-resolution knowledge from the well-trained complex teacher model is first adapted to public high-resolution faces and then transferred to a simply student model. The student model is designed to identify low-resolution faces, and could perform face recognition in the wild effectively and efficiently. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms several existing models for low-resolution face recognition in the wild.},

  pages={185991-186003},
  abstract={This paper develops an incremental randomized learning method for an extended Echo State Network (φ-ESN), which has a reservoir with random static projection, to better cope with non-linear time series data modelling problems. Although the typical ESN can effectively improve the prediction performance of the network by extending a random static nonlinear hidden layer, since the input weights and biases of the hidden neurons in the extended static layer are randomly assigned, some neurons have little effect on reducing the model error, resulting in high model complexity, poor generalization and large performance fluctuation. A constructive incremental randomized learning method termed OLS-φ-ESN is proposed for generating the nodes of the extended static nonlinear hidden layer. Two-step training paradigm is adopted, namely, randomly assigning the input weights and biases of the hidden neurons in the extended static layer according to a supervisory mechanism and solving output weights by least squares algorithm. Based on Orthogonal Least Squares (OLS) search algorithm, the proposed supervisory mechanism is designed where an adaptive threshold is also set to better control the compactness of the generated learner model. Simulation results concerning both nonlinear time series prediction and system identification tasks indicate some advantages of our proposed OLS-φ-ESN in terms of more compact model and sound generalization.},

  abstract={Learning without constraints of space and time has nowadays become a reality thanks to the exponential growth of the Internet, and distance learning is one of the areas for which that growth has been the most beneficial. The Web offers several platforms for distance learning, calibrated for the public or private sector. Among these, the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are one of the most popular online learning assets. In MOOCs, a crucial feature is given by the amount of enrolled learners: thousands can attend such courses. Consequently, monitoring the learning process of individual students is a challenging task for teachers in MOOCs. Peer Assessment can be used, in these case, as a teaching strategy, to follow the dynamics of a MOOC while not checking directly on each one of the individual students. In previous work we have presented a method to support peer assessment, and grades inference, mediated by a limited grading work performed by the teacher. The method is based on a definition of student model based on a modified version of the machine learning technique called K-NN. In this paper we present a system able to simulate the dynamics of a MOOC class where peer assessment, mediated by the teacher, takes place. The system supports the creation of a (big) class, and the simulation of peer assessment sessions, where peer grading, and teacher grading take place. The system, then, allows for a statistical analysis of how the student models computed by the system, and the grades inferred for the peers' tasks, converge towards the real values for the student models and grades.},

One of their most important aspects concerns the personalization and the adaptation of the learning procedures to learners' characteristics. This is mainly achieved with the use of student modelling which is employed to record user context and to enhance the learning experience of the students. In this work, we present a generic ontology that incorporates concepts and properties used to model user profiles in order to formulate concrete, complete and extensible user modelling in e-learning systems. The ontology consists of learners' personal, cognitive and social information as well as information about their performance and skills. In order to keep the student model updated, semantic rules are utilized to analyse student learning and to extract knowledge regarding their performance. The ontological approach is domain independent and can be utilized as a reference model for learner representation in intelligent tutoring systems in higher and distance education.},

  abstract={Person re-identification (Re-ID), for matching pedestrians across non-overlapping camera views, has made great progress in supervised learning with abundant labelled data. However, the scalability problem is the bottleneck for applications in large-scale systems. We consider the scalability problem of Re-ID from three aspects: (1) low labelling cost by reducing label amount, (2) low extension cost by reusing existing knowledge and (3) low testing computation cost by using lightweight models. The requirements render scalable Re-ID a challenging problem. To solve these problems in a unified system, we propose a Multi-teacher Adaptive Similarity Distillation Framework, which requires only a few labelled identities of target domain to transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models to a user-specified lightweight student model without accessing source domain data. We propose the Log-Euclidean Similarity Distillation Loss for Re-ID and further integrate the Adaptive Knowledge Aggregator to select effective teacher models to transfer target-adaptive knowledge. Extensive evaluations show that our method can extend with high scalability and the performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised Re-ID methods.},

Predicting early actions is very challenging since the partially observed videos do not contain enough action information for recognition. In this paper, we aim at improving early action prediction by proposing a novel teacher-student learning framework. Our framework involves a teacher model for recognizing actions from full videos, a student model for predicting early actions from partial videos, and a teacher-student learning block for distilling progressive knowledge from teacher to student, crossing different tasks. Extensive experiments on three public action datasets show that the proposed progressive teacher-student learning framework can consistently improve performance of early action prediction model. We have also reported the state-of-the-art performances for early action prediction on all of these sets.},

Our goal is to train a lightweight and versatile student model, without human-labelled annotations, that amalgamates the knowledge and masters the expertise of two pre-trained teacher models working on heterogeneous problems, one on scene parsing and the other on depth estimation. To this end, we propose an innovative training strategy that learns the parameters of the student intertwined with the teachers, achieved by ``projecting'' its amalgamated features onto each teacher's domain and computing the loss. We also introduce two options to generalize the proposed training strategy to handle three or more tasks simultaneously. The proposed scheme yields very encouraging results. As demonstrated on several benchmarks, the trained student model achieves results even superior to those of the teachers in their own expertise domains and on par with the state-of-the-art fully supervised models relying on human-labelled annotations.},

  abstract={State-of-the-art CNN based recognition models are often computationally prohibitive to deploy on low-end devices. A promising high level approach tackling this limitation is knowledge distillation, which let small student model mimic cumbersome teacher model's output to get improved generalization. However, related methods mainly focus on simple task of classification while do not consider complex tasks like object detection. We show applying the vanilla knowledge distillation to detection model gets minor gain. To address the challenge of distilling knowledge in detection model, we propose a fine-grained feature imitation method exploiting the cross-location discrepancy of feature response. Our intuition is that detectors care more about local near object regions. Thus the discrepancy of feature response on the near object anchor locations reveals important information of how teacher model tends to generalize. We design a novel mechanism to estimate those locations and let student model imitate the teacher on them to get enhanced performance. We first validate the idea on a developed lightweight toy detector which carries simplest notion of current state-of-the-art anchor based detection models on challenging KITTI dataset, our method generates up to 15% boost of mAP for the student model compared to the non-imitated counterpart. We then extensively evaluate the method with Faster R-CNN model under various scenarios with common object detection benchmark of Pascal VOC and COCO, imitation alleviates up to 74% performance drop of student model compared to teacher.

  abstract={In heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA), since the feature spaces of the source and target domains are different, knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain is really challenging. How to align the different feature spaces and then adaptively transfer the related knowledge is critical for HDA. In this paper, we develop an adaptive teacher-and-student model for heterogeneous domain adaptation (AtsHDA). In AtsHDA, the source domain as a teacher and the target domain as a student are aligned or co-adapted to each other first, so that their correlation can be maximized. Then the target domain adaptively learns from the source domain. Specifically, there is a balance between the learning by the target domain itself and the instruction from the source domain. That is, when the guidance from the source domain is helpful for learning, the learning of target classifier emphasizes the instruction of source knowledge, and considers its own knowledge more, otherwise. Further, an ensemble method is designed to decide such a balance. Finally, empirical results show that AtsHDA can achieve competitive results compared with the state-of-arts.},

  abstract={We present a proposal for reduction of Dyslexia in children including protocol and findings; the protocol does not include a diagnostic phase for purposes of classification or searching for pathologies, we use a remedial training instead in order to configure a user model of strengths and weaknesses for a well-balanced instructional plan. The protocol phases are as follows: remedial training (as diagnostic and information collecting), configuration of a user model, planning of instructional plan based on user model, plan implementation, evaluation. The proposal is a kind of remedial training based on computer, many scientific research publications demonstrating that remedial training as a viable solution to reduction of Dyslexia. The findings are very similar to previous studies about that computer software has been a viable support of remedial training; studies refers to many points where remedial training could be useful, the first one is training in phonological structure of the words in the native language to reach a minimal level of phonological awareness; The best recommendation is training in phonological awareness before to learn to read and write; training in phonological awareness seems to have many benefits in reduction of Dyslexia and increment of reading skills [1]. The proposal reports favorable results using Testing Effect, which is a concept of cognitive psychology that enhanced long-term memory known; Testing effect had not been commonly associated as a remedial training for Dyslexia but many studies in other areas have shown promising results in basic operations like reading, writing and learning. Testing effect enhances long-term memory by doing many tests, this process of retrieving makes the information more retrievable even in long-term compared to simply studying. To implement this proposal we did use an electronic format content known as Learning Objects. Learning Object has many benefits like interoperability because it is a piece of software that can be easily read by many electronical dispositive and can contain an activity of assessment of learning as quizzes or tests. That is the particularities and philosophy of Learning Object as technology of contents. During this first phase (diagnostic), the goal of using Learning Object was testing of word recognition with test of multiple option. In this study, there is not a phonological awareness training, the testing was with one person only who is a 9 years old boy, and the training was useful and get higher results in word recognition within this context. The goal of use a remedial training supported with computer is to reduce absence from school and integrate the individual into any society activity that include reading and writing.},

  abstract={Cooling of IT equipment consumes a large proportion of a modern data centre's energy budget and is therefore an important target for optimal control. This study analyses a scaled down system of six servers with cooling fans by implementing a minimal data driven time-series model in TensorFlow/Keras, a modern software package popular for deep learning. The model is inspired by the physical laws of heat exchange, but with all parameters obtained by optimisation. It is encoded as a customised Recurrent Neural Network and exposed to the time-series data via n-step Prediction Error Minimisation (PEM). The thus obtained Digital Twin of the physical system is then used directly to construct a Model Predictive Control (MPC) type regulator that executes in real time. The MPC is then compared in simulation with a self-tuning PID controller that adjust its parameters on-line by gradient descent.},

  abstract={With the recent success of convolutional neural network (CNN) based text detection approaches, designing better CNN-based text detection frameworks has become a major research focus to improve text detection accuracy. In this paper, instead of following this direction, we propose to use a born-again training strategy, which is based on teacher-student learning (TSL), to improve the accuracy of the state-of-the-art CNN-based text detectors. More specifically, given a well-trained CNN-based text detector, we take it as a teacher model and train from scratch a new student model with the same topology under the supervision of both the teacher model and ground-truth labels. Furthermore, we propose a new proposal-free multi-level feature mimicking approach to making multi-level convolutional feature maps be effectively mimicked in a unified manner. Experiments demonstrate that the student models trained by the proposed approach can achieve substantially better results than their teacher models and have better generalization abilities.},

With the overall system behaviour hard to know a-priori and conventional techniques for system-wide analysis either lacking in rigour or defeated by the scale of the problem, the current practice often exclusively relies on human expertise for monitoring and adaptation. We present an approach that combines ideas from modeling & simulation, reinforcement learning and control theory to make enterprises adaptive.

  abstract={Teacher-student learning can be applied in automatic speech recognition for model compression and domain adaptation. This trains a student model to emulate the behaviour of a teacher model, and only the student is used to perform recognition. Depending on the application, the teacher and student may differ in their model types, complexities, input contexts, and input features. In previous works, it is often shown that learning from a strong teacher allows the student to perform better than an equivalent model trained with only the reference transcriptions. However, there has not been much investigation into whether a particular form of teacher is appropriate for the student to learn from. This paper aims to study how effectively the student is able to learn from the teacher, when differences exist between their designs. The Augmented Multi-party Interaction (AMI) meeting transcription and Multi-Genre Broadcast (MGB-3) television broadcast audio tasks are used in this analysis. Experimental results suggest that a student can effectively learn from a more complex teacher, but may struggle when it lacks input information. It is therefore important to carefully consider the design of the student for each application.},

  abstract={Distillation-based learning boosts the performance of the miniaturized neural network based on the hypothesis that the representation of a teacher model can be used as structured and relatively weak supervision, and thus would be easily learned by a miniaturized model. However, we find that the representation of a converged heavy model is still a strong constraint for training a small student model, which leads to a higher lower bound of congruence loss. In this work, we consider the knowledge distillation from the perspective of curriculum learning by teacher's routing. Instead of supervising the student model with a converged teacher model, we supervised it with some anchor points selected from the route in parameter space that the teacher model passed by, as we called route constrained optimization (RCO). We experimentally demonstrate this simple operation greatly reduces the lower bound of congruence loss for knowledge distillation, hint and mimicking learning. On close-set classification tasks like CIFAR and ImageNet, RCO improves knowledge distillation by 2.14% and 1.5% respectively. For the sake of evaluating the generalization, we also test RCO on the open-set face recognition task MegaFace. RCO achieves 84.3% accuracy on one-to-million task with only 0.8 M parameters, which push the SOTA by a large margin.},

  pages={6727-6735},
  abstract={Recently, consistency-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised learning (SSL). These methods always involve two roles, an explicit or implicit teacher model and a student model, and penalize predictions under different perturbations by a consistency constraint. However, the weights of these two roles are tightly coupled since the teacher is essentially an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student. In this work, we show that the coupled EMA teacher causes a performance bottleneck. To address this problem, we introduce Dual Student, which replaces the teacher with another student. We also define a novel concept, stable sample, following which a stabilization constraint is designed for our structure to be trainable. Further, we discuss two variants of our method, which produce even higher performance. Extensive experiments show that our method improves the classification performance significantly on several main SSL benchmarks. Specifically, it reduces the error rate of the 13-layer CNN from 16.84% to 12.39% on CIFAR-10 with 1k labels and from 34.10% to 31.56% on CIFAR-100 with 10k labels. In addition, our method also achieves a clear improvement in domain adaptation.},

  abstract={High-quality computer vision models typically address the problem of understanding the general distribution of real-world images. However, most cameras observe only a very small fraction of this distribution. This offers the possibility of achieving more efficient inference by specializing compact, low-cost models to the specific distribution of frames observed by a single camera. In this paper, we employ the technique of model distillation (supervising a low-cost student model using the output of a high-cost teacher) to specialize accurate, low-cost semantic segmentation models to a target video stream. Rather than learn a specialized student model on offline data from the video stream, we train the student in an online fashion on the live video, intermittently running the teacher to provide a target for learning. Online model distillation yields semantic segmentation models that closely approximate their Mask R-CNN teacher with 7 to 17× lower inference runtime cost (11 to 26× in FLOPs), even when the target video's distribution is non-stationary. Our method requires no offline pretraining on the target video stream, achieves higher accuracy and lower cost than solutions based on flow or video object segmentation, and can exhibit better temporal stability than the original teacher. We also provide a new video dataset for evaluating the efficiency of inference over long running video streams.},

  pages={4571-4580},
  abstract={We deal with the problem of modality distillation for the purpose of remote sensing (RS) image classification by exploring the deep generative models. From the remote sensing perspective, this problem can also be considered in line with the missing bands problem frequently encountered due to sensor abnormality. It is expected that different modalities provide useful complementary information regarding a given task, thus leading to the training of a robust prediction model. Although training data may be collected from different sensor modalities, it is many a time possible that not all the information are readily available during the model inference phase. This paper tackles the problem by proposing a novel adversarial training driven hallucination architecture which is capable of learning discriminative feature representations corresponding to the missing modalities from the available ones during the test time. To this end, we follow a teacher-student model where the teacher is trained on the multimodal data (learning with privileged information) and the student model learns to subsequently distill the feature descriptors corresponding to the missing modality. Experimental results obtained on the benchmark hyperspectral (HSI) datasets and another dataset of multispectral (MS)-panchromatic (PAN) image pairs confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach. In particular, we find that the student model is consistently able to surpass the performance of the teacher model for HSI datasets.},

  abstract={Recently, instance segmentation models have been developed to a great promising accuracy on public benchmarks. However, these models are too heavy to be applied for real applications due to their low inference speed. In this paper, we propose a faster instance segmentation model utilizing a teacher-student learning framework that transfers the knowledge obtained by a well-trained teacher model to a lightweight student model. In addition to the conventional strategy of knowledge distillation in classification or semantic segmentation networks which are both single-task networks, we investigate a hierarchical distillation (H-Dis) framework for structure information distillation on multi-task learning based instance segmentation. H-Dis consists of two distillation schemes: representation distillation that distills pair-wise quantized feature maps shared by multi-heads, and semantic distillation that makes sure to distill each head information in an instance level. In particular, we present channel-wise distillation for the segmentation head to achieve instance-level mask knowledge transfer. To evaluate our approach, we carry out experiments with different settings of distillation methods on different datasets Pascal VOC and Cityscapes. Our experiments prove that our approach is effective for accelerating instance segmentation models with less accuracy drop under limited computing resources.},

  abstract={Attention-based encoder-decoder models significantly reduce the burden of developing multilingual speech recognition systems. By means of end-to-end modeling and parameters sharing, a single model can be efficiently trained and deployed for all languages. Although the single model benefits from jointly training across different languages, it should handle the variation and diversity of the languages at the same time. In this paper, we exploit knowledge distillation from multiple teachers to improve the recognition accuracy of the end-to-end multilingual model. Considering that teacher models learning from monolingual and multilingual data contain distinct knowledge of specific languages, we introduce multiple teachers including monolingual teachers of each language, and multilingual teacher to teach a same sized multilingual student model so that the multilingual student will learn various knowledge embedded in the data and intend to outperform multilingual teacher. Different from conventional knowledge distillation which usually relies on a linear interpolation for hard loss from true label and soft losses from teachers, a new random augmented training strategy is proposed to switch the optimization of the student model between hard or soft losses in random order. Our experiments on Wall Street Journal (English) and AISHELL-1 (Chinese) composed multilingual speech dataset show the proposed multiple teachers and distillation strategy boost the performance of the student significantly relative to the multilingual teacher.},

  abstract={This paper to Practice Full Paper presents about a procedure to generate the learners' data using a learner model based on first-order lag system to generate learners data. By using the generated data, the learners are classified into several groups and some learners with low understanding degree can be extracted by using the neural networks. It is necessary to provide learning support corresponding to the understanding degree of each learner in a class to improve effective learning. By providing additional education for the learners who are predicted as low degree by the proposed procedure, it is expected to take countermeasures for not becoming “dropout students” in early stage. For this purpose, predicting the understanding degree is important, and this paper employs a recurrent neural network as the predictor. Hayashida et al. (2018) have constructed to classify the learners by understanding degree at the end of the class based on some observed data such as result of quizzes, or report tasks by using FNN (Feedforward Neural Network). This paper uses a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) which consists of feedforward signal processing and structure of the signal feedbacks because of the observed data is time-series data. This paper proposes a learner model based on first-order lag system to generate learner data for training RNNs. As experimental result of the simulation, this paper succeeds in extracting the learner group with low understanding degree in future.},

  abstract={With the development of network technology and data mining technology, personalized learning path recommendation in intelligent teaching system has become an important issue. Choosing the right learning object and recommending it to learners is a challenge for online learning systems. At present, the problem faced by online learning is that the information overload causes the learner cannot find a learning resource suitable for himself, and the recommended learning resource cannot satisfy the individual needs of the learner. The recommendation system is an important means of information filtering and a very promising method for solving information overload problems. Therefore, adaptive learning path recommendation is considered to be an effective means to solve the above problems in online learning. In this paper, we propose a learning path generation algorithm based on network embedding and learning effects. First, we use the network embedding to learn the user's expression in order to judge the learner's similarity. Then we generate an adaptive learning path for current learners based on the similarity between all historical learners and current learners and the learning effects of historical learners. The experimental results show that the average grade of the learners using our recommended learning path has been greatly improved. (Abstract)},

It is not possible to dynamically monitor user interest drift. In this work, we propose a user model named Attention-Based User Temporal Model (AUTM). The key design of our work is to use the attention model to dynamically assign importance weights to user embedding of RNN network outputs at different times, and then combine the static user embedding.

The teacher may have difficulty in identifying it because of the diversity of students' abilities. To solve this problem, we propose an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that offers adaptive exercises. In adaptive exercises, the next problem to be solved by a student is chosen by considering her performance during learning. Unlike former ITS that is mostly based on students' knowledge, the proposed ITS uses students' knowledge and misconceptions to perform adaptation. This paper discusses the implemented learning scenario and domain model structure to support adaptive exercises. Furthermore, it discusses information about the student recorded in the student model and how it is organized and inferred to find the most appropriate problem.},

  abstract={Intelligent Tutoring Systems are promising tools for delivering optimal and personalized learning experiences to students. A key component for their personalization is the student model, which infers the knowledge level of the students to balance the difficulty of the exercises. While important advances have been achieved, several challenges remain. In particular, the models should be able to track in real-time the evolution of the students' knowledge levels. These evolutions are likely to follow different profiles for each student, while measuring the exact knowledge level remains difficult given the limited and noisy information provided by the interactions. This paper introduces a novel model that addresses these challenges with three contributions:. 1) the model relies on Gaussian Processes to track online the evolution of the student's knowledge level over time, 2) it uses collaborative filtering to rapidly provide long-term predictions by leveraging the information from previous users, and 3) it automatically generates abstract representations of knowledge components via automatic relevance determination of covariance matrices. The model is evaluated on three datasets, including real users. The results demonstrate that the model converges to accurate predictions in average four times faster than the compared methods.},

  pages={172-185},
  abstract={Intelligent learning environments can be designed to support the development of learners' cognitive skills, strategies, and metacognitive processes as they work on complex decision-making and problem-solving tasks. However, the complexity of the tasks may impede the progress of novice learners. Providing adaptive feedback to learners who face difficulties requires learner modeling approaches that can identify learners' proficiencies and the difficulties they face in executing required skills, strategies, and metacognitive processes. This paper discusses a multilevel hierarchical learner modeling scheme that analyzes and captures learners' cognitive processes and problem-solving strategies along with their performance on assigned tasks in a game-based environment called UrbanSim that requires complex decision making for dealing with counterinsurgency scenarios. As the scenario evolves in a turn-by-turn fashion, UrbanSim evaluates the learners' moves using a number of performance measures. Our learner modeling scheme interprets the reported performance values by analyzing the learners' activities captured in log files to derive learners' proficiencies in associated cognitive skills and strategies, and updates the learner model. We discuss the details of the learner modeling algorithms in this paper, and then demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting results from a study we conducted at Vanderbilt University.},

  volume={17},
  number={11},
  pages={1909-1913},
  abstract={This letter proposes a deep learning model to deal with the spatial transfer challenge for the mapping of irrigated areas through the analysis of Sentinel-1 data. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model called “Teacher Model” is trained on a source geographical area characterized by a huge volume of samples. Then, this model is transferred from the source area to the target area characterized by a limited number of samples. The transfer learning framework is based on a distill and refine strategy, in which the teacher model is first distilled into a student model and, successively, refined by data samples coming from the target geographical area. The proposed strategy is compared with different approaches including a random forest (RF) classifier trained on the target data set and a CNN trained on the source data set and directly applied on the target area as well as several CNN classifiers trained on the target data set. The evaluation of the performed transfer strategy shows that the “distill and refine” framework obtains the best performance compared with other competing approaches. The obtained findings represent a first step toward the understanding of the spatial transferability of deep learning models in the Earth observation domain.},

  volume={14},

  pages={665-675},
  abstract={Visual food recognition on mobile devices has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its roles in individual diet monitoring and social health management and analysis. Existing visual food recognition approaches usually use large server-based networks to achieve high accuracy. However, these networks are not compact enough to be deployed on mobile devices. Even though some compact architectures have been proposed, most of them are unable to obtain the performance of full-size networks. In view of this, this paper proposes a Joint-learning Distilled Network (JDNet) that targets to achieve a high food recognition accuracy of a compact student network by learning from a large teacher network, while retaining a compact network size. Compared to the conventional one-directional knowledge distillation methods, the proposed JDNet has a novel joint-learning framework where the large teacher network and the small student network are trained simultaneously, by leveraging on different intermediate layer features in both network. JDNet introduces a new Multi-Stage Knowledge Distillation (MSKD) for simultaneous student-teacher training at different levels of abstraction. A new Instance Activation Learning (IAL) is also proposed to jointly train student and teacher on instance activation map of each training sample. Experimental results show that the trained student model is able to achieve a state-of-the-art Top-1 recognition accuracy on the benchmark UECFood-256 and Food-101 datasets at 84.0% and 91.2%, respectively, and retaining a 4x smaller network size for mobile deployment.},

  abstract={Digital twin can be defined as a virtual representation of a physical asset enabled through data and simulators for real-time prediction, optimization, monitoring, controlling, and improved decision making. Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent status of methodologies and techniques related to the construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges and enabling technologies along with recommendations and reflections for various stakeholders.},

  pages={26637-26664},
  abstract={Our research work describes a team of human Digital Twins (DTs), each tracking fitness-related measurements describing an athlete's behavior in consecutive days (e.g. food income, activity, sleep). After collecting enough measurements, the DT firstly predicts the physical twin performance during training and, in case of non-optimal result, it suggests modifications in the athlete's behavior. The athlete's team is integrated into SmartFit, a software framework for supporting trainers and coaches in monitoring and manage athletes' fitness activity and results. Through IoT sensors embedded in wearable devices and applications for manual logging (e.g. mood, food income), SmartFit continuously captures measurements, initially treated as the dynamic data describing the current physical twins' status. Dynamic data allows adapting each DT's status and triggering the DT's predictions and suggestions. The analyzed measurements are stored as the historical data, further processed by the DT to update (increase) its knowledge and ability to provide reliable predictions. Results show that, thanks to the team of DTs, SmartFit computes trustable predictions of the physical twins' conditions and produces understandable suggestions which can be used by trainers to trigger optimization actions in the athletes' behavior. Though applied in the sport context, SmartFit can be easily adapted to other monitoring tasks.},

  year={2020},
  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={38032-38044},
  abstract={One of the most commonly method for sound event detection is the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) or convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) and their variants. However, the pooling operation of the CNN has the disadvantage of losing the location information of the target object. We don't use the pooling operation, retaining ReLU and convolution operation, and we use the dictionary strong constraints and penalty function prior constraints of the multi-layer convolutional sparse coding (ML-CSC). We proposed iterative deep neural networks, the unfolded multi-layer local block coordinate descent networks (ML-LoBCoD-NET), driven by the multi-layer local block coordinate descent algorithm (ML-LoBCoD) which is extended from the local block coordinate descent (LoBCoD) algorithm. The ML-LoBCoD-NET can extract features different from the CNN. More importantly, for weakly-supervised sound event detection task, we proposed the MRNN-Att network which combines the ML-LoBCoD-NET, a recurrent neural network (RNN), and an attention network. The MCRNN-Att network combines MRNN-Att and CRNN network for fusing the different features. Furthermore, for semi-supervised sound event detection task, the MRNN-Att mean teacher model (MRNN-Att-MT) and the MCRNN-Att mean teacher model (MCRNN-Att-MT) are proposed, in which the MRNN-Att and the MCRNN-Att network are selected as the student model. These models were tested on the dataset of Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2018 Task 4. The F1 score of the MRNN-Att-MT on the development set was 22.83%, which was 8.77% higher than the baseline system. The score of the MRNN-Att-MT on the evaluation set was 15.68%, which was 4.88% higher than the baseline system. The MCRNN-Att-MT model had an F1 score of 20.35% on the development set, which was 6.29% higher than the baseline system and the F1 score of 14.56% on the evaluation set, which was 3.76% higher than the baseline system.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant advances in computer vision and sensor-based smart sensing. DNNs achieve prominent results based on standard data sets and powerful servers, whereas, in real applications with domain-shift data and resource-constrained environments such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in the edge computing, DNNs are likely to have degraded performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. To this end, we develop the MobileDA framework that learns transferable features while keeping the simple structure of the deep model. Our method allows a novel teacher network trained in the server to distill the knowledge for a student network running in the edge device, which is achieved by a cross-domain distillation. Leveraging unlabeled data in the new environment, our student model amends the feature learning to be domain invariant, then being our objective model running in the edge device. Our approach is evaluated on a challenging IoT-based WiFi gesture recognition scenario, and three classic visual adaptation benchmarks. The empirical studies corroborate the effectiveness of distillation for domain transfer, and the overall results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance merely using a simple network.},

  abstract={This overview outlines key issues in learning with an open learner model (OLM). Originally, learner models remained hidden, as their primary role was to enable a system to personalize the educational interaction. Opening the model in an understandable form provides additional methods of prompting reflection, planning, and other metacognitive activities that are important in learning. Learner-system discussion, editing or other interaction about the learner model can allow users to contribute more directly to the modeling process to increase its accuracy, while at the same time, further facilitating reflection as they justify their viewpoints to themselves and the system. Social learning can be supported by opening learner models to peers, helping learners to gauge their relative progress, and effectively seek collaborators. OLMs can also provide useful information to others supporting the learning process, such as teachers and parents. OLMs are set to take an increasing role as new learning technologies develop.},

  abstract={Purveyors of malicious network attacks continue to increase the complexity and the sophistication of their techniques, and their ability to evade detection continues to improve as well. Hence, intrusion detection systems must also evolve to meet these increasingly challenging threats. Machine learning is often used to support this needed improvement. However, training a good prediction model can require a large set of labeled training data. Such datasets are difficult to obtain because privacy concerns prevent the majority of intrusion detection agencies from sharing their sensitive data. In this paper, we propose the use of mimic learning to enable the transfer of intrusion detection knowledge through a teacher model trained on private data to a student model. This student model provides a mean of publicly sharing knowledge extracted from private data without sharing the data itself. Our results confirm that the proposed scheme can produce a student intrusion detection model that mimics the teacher model without requiring access to the original dataset.},

  abstract={Deep-learning based speech separation models confront poor generalization problem that even the state-of-the-art models could abruptly fail when evaluating them in mismatch conditions. To address this problem, we propose an easy-to-implement yet effective consistency based semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach, namely Mixup-Breakdown training (MBT). It learns a teacher model to "breakdown" unlabeled inputs, and the estimated separations are interpolated to produce more useful pseudo "mixup" input-output pairs, on which the consistency regularization could apply for learning a student model. In our experiment, we evaluate MBT under various conditions with ascending degrees of mismatch, including unseen interfering speech, noise, and music, and compare MBT’s generalization capability against state-of-the-art supervised learning and SSL approaches. The result indicates that MBT significantly outperforms several strong baselines with up to 13.77% relative SI-SNRi improvement. Moreover, MBT only adds negligible computational overhead to standard training schemes.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD) approach is widely used in the deep learning field mainly for model size reduction. KD utilizes soft labels of teacher model, which contain the dark- knowledge that one-hot ground-truth does not have. This knowledge can improve the performance of already saturated student model. In case of multiple-teacher models, generally, the same weighted average (interpolated training) of multiple-teacher's labels is applied to KD training. However, if the knowledge characteristics among teachers are somewhat different, the interpolated training can be at risk of crushing each knowledge characteristics and can also raise noise component. In this paper, we propose an entropy based KD training, which utilizes the teacher model labels with lower entropy at a larger rate among the various teacher models. The proposed method shows a better performance than the conventional KD training scheme in automatic speech recognition.},

We propose training methods for building neural language models for such a task, which are not only domain robust, but reasonable in model size and fast for evaluation. We combine knowledge distillation from pretrained domain expert language models with the noise contrastive estimation (NCE) loss. Knowledge distillation allows to train a single student model which is both compact and domain robust, while the use of NCE loss makes the model self-normalized, which enables fast evaluation. We conduct experiments on a large English multi-domain speech recognition dataset provided by AppTek. The resulting student model is of the size of one domain expert, while it gives similar perplexities as various teacher models on their expert domain; the model is self-normalized, allowing for 30% faster first pass decoding than the naive models which require the full soft- max computation, and finally it gives improvements of more than 8% relative in terms of word error rate over a large multidomain 4-gram count model trained on more than 10 B words.},

  abstract={We propose a simple but efficient method termed Guided Learning for weakly-labeled semi-supervised sound event detection (SED). There are two sub-targets implied in weakly-labeled SED: audio tagging and boundary detection. Instead of designing a single model by considering a trade-off between the two sub-targets, we design a teacher model aiming at audio tagging to guide a student model aiming at boundary detection to learn using the unlabeled data. The guidance is guaranteed by the audio tagging performance gap of the two models. In the meantime, the student model liberated from the trade-off is able to provide more excellent boundary detection results. We propose a principle to design such two models based on the relation between the temporal compression scale and the two sub-targets. We also propose an end-to-end semi-supervised learning process for these two models to enable their abilities to rise alternately. Experiments on the DCASE2018 Task4 dataset show that our approach achieves competitive performance.},

  abstract={Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable accuracy improvements for automatic modulation classification. However, the employed networks often have millions of parameters and need very high computation, which makes it difficult to deploy these models on portable devices with limited resources. We propose a cross model deep learning scheme to build a lightweight deep network for accurate modulation classification. Firstly, a large Hybrid DNN (HDNN) that is composed of convolutional and recurrent layers is constructed and trained for automatic and accurate classification of signals. Then we build a smaller Layered Resnet Network (LRN) with shallow layers and few nodes. The HDNN and LRN are taken as a Teacher Model (TM) and a Student Model (SM) respectively. Finally, a knowledge distillation method is proposed to guide the learning of the SM, by formulating a teaching loss from the prediction of the TM to train the SM. The performances of the proposed HDNN and LRN are investigated on the public RadioML2016.10a and RadioML2016.10b data sets. The experimental results show that the trained HDNN presents state-of-the-art classification results and the LRN trained in this scheme takes only about a sixth of the HDNN's inference time and consumes only 472.3KB for storage, with a slight accuracy decrease compared with the large HDNN.},

  pages={231-236},
  abstract={Electronic health records (EHR) systems contain vast amounts of medical information about patients. These data can be used to train machine learning models that can predict health status, as well as to help prevent future diseases or disabilities. However, getting patients' medical data to obtain well-trained machine learning models is a challenging task. This is because sharing the patients' medical records is prohibited by law in most countries due to patients privacy concerns. In this paper, we tackle this problem by sharing the models instead of the original sensitive data by using the mimic learning approach. The idea is first to train a model on the original sensitive data, called the teacher model. Then, using this model, we can transfer its knowledge to another model, called the student model, without the need to learn the original data used in training the teacher model. The student model is then shared to the public and can be used to make accurate predictions. To assess the mimic learning approach, we have evaluated our scheme using different medical datasets. The results indicate that the student model mimics the teacher model performance in terms of prediction accuracy without the need to access to the patients' original data records.},

  volume={29},
  number={},
  pages={6898-6908},
  abstract={Face recognition in the wild is now advancing towards light-weight models, fast inference speed and resolution-adapted capability. In this paper, we propose a bridge distillation approach to turn a complex face model pretrained on private high-resolution faces into a light-weight one for low-resolution face recognition. In our approach, such a cross-dataset resolution-adapted knowledge transfer problem is solved via two-step distillation. In the first step, we conduct cross-dataset distillation to transfer the prior knowledge from private high-resolution faces to public high-resolution faces and generate compact and discriminative features. In the second step, the resolution-adapted distillation is conducted to further transfer the prior knowledge to synthetic low-resolution faces via multi-task learning. By learning low-resolution face representations and mimicking the adapted high-resolution knowledge, a light-weight student model can be constructed with high efficiency and promising accuracy in recognizing low-resolution faces. Experimental results show that the student model performs impressively in recognizing low-resolution faces with only 0.21M parameters and 0.057MB memory.

  title={A Noise-Robust Framework for Automatic Segmentation of COVID-19 Pneumonia Lesions From CT Images}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={39},
  number={8},
  pages={2653-2663},
  abstract={Segmentation of pneumonia lesions from CT scans of COVID-19 patients is important for accurate diagnosis and follow-up. Deep learning has a potential to automate this task but requires a large set of high-quality annotations that are difficult to collect. Learning from noisy training labels that are easier to obtain has a potential to alleviate this problem. To this end, we propose a novel noise-robust framework to learn from noisy labels for the segmentation task. We first introduce a noise-robust Dice loss that is a generalization of Dice loss for segmentation and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss for robustness against noise, then propose a novel COVID-19 Pneumonia Lesion segmentation network (COPLE-Net) to better deal with the lesions with various scales and appearances. The noise-robust Dice loss and COPLE-Net are combined with an adaptive self-ensembling framework for training, where an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of a student model is used as a teacher model that is adaptively updated by suppressing the contribution of the student to EMA when the student has a large training loss. The student model is also adaptive by learning from the teacher only when the teacher outperforms the student. Experimental results showed that: (1) our noise-robust Dice loss outperforms existing noise-robust loss functions, (2) the proposed COPLE-Net achieves higher performance than state-of-the-art image segmentation networks, and (3) our framework with adaptive self-ensembling significantly outperforms a standard training process and surpasses other noise-robust training approaches in the scenario of learning from noisy labels for COVID-19 pneumonia lesion segmentation.},

  abstract={SDVN is a promising architecture to extend the computation resources which break through the limitations of current vehicular networks. It is possible to learn new networking schemes by observing the surrounding environment in SDVN. However, within SDVN, the construction and application of such schemes still lack proper consideration in data collection, prediction, verification, and validation before applying these schemes in the real network, which is due to the limited knowledge of the physical environment. Intelligent Digital Twin (IDT) was initially designed for realizing intelligent manufacturing by virtualizing and learning the data of the physical space in cyberspace. Hence, bringing IDT to networking can provide additional valuable functionalities to meet the above considerations by constructing a virtual intelligent network space, aiming to realize the iterative update of the networking schemes in an adaptive way. In this article, we introduce a new network architecture, IDT-SDVN, by maximizing the advantages of SDVNs. We present the challenges and open issues of IDT-SDVNs. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of SDVNs. The experimental results show that significant improvement of performance is achieved for vehicular networking with the proposed IDT-SDVNs.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD) is a new method for transferring knowledge of a structure under training to another one. The conventional application of KD is in the form of learning a small model (named as a student) by soft labels produced by a complex model (named as a teacher). Due to the novel idea introduced in KD, recently, its notion is used in different methods such as compression and processes that are going to enhance the model accuracy. Although different techniques are proposed in the area of KD, there is a lack of a model to generalize KD techniques. In this paper, various studies in the scope of KD are investigated and analyzed to build a general model for KD. All the methods and techniques in KD can be summarized through the proposed model. By utilizing the proposed model, different methods in KD are better investigated and explored. The advantages and disadvantages of different approaches in KD can be better understood and developing a new strategy for KD can be possible. Using the proposed model, different KD methods are represented in an abstract view.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT) is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in various industries. It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the “softwarization” of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.},

  abstract={The concepts of Digital Twin has been recently introduced, it refers to functional connections between a complex physical system and its high-fidelity digital replica. Digital Twin process workflow is proposed in case of Mohammed VI Bridge modeling in Morocco. The current maintenance of a road infrastructure is based on a manual inspection and a system based on traditional tools. Aging infrastructures require a new approach to maintenance in terms of inspection, bridge maintenance system, simulation and systematic evaluation. This system now exists and is called the Digital Twin. Digital Twin can be thought of as a virtual prototype in service that changes dynamically in near real time as its physical twin changes. An urban infrastructure digital twin is a virtual instance of his physical twin that is continuously updated with multisource, multisensor and multitemporal data that can be used for monitoring, simulating and forecasting any potential problem that may appear in the structure and proposing planning for repair and maintenance of health status throughout the life cycle of this infrastructure. This work presents a general vision and a justification for integrating DT technology with geospatial data. The paper examines the benefits of integrating 3D GIS data acquired by automated mobile mapping (MMS) workflows for modeling the reality of a major bridge infrastructure in Morocco. This allowed to study the future performance of this bridge structure on virtual twin structures under different environmental conditions. Cloud point data are acquired by a Mobile Mapping System on Mohammed VI Bridge and converted in BIM model by a scan to BIM process and is integrated in a GIS and BIM virtual environment and shows the efficiency of volumetric auscultation in terms of surface flatness and distortion inspection. This project provides a new bridge maintenance system using the concept of a Digital Twin. This digital model is a platform that allows to collect, organize and share the maintenance history of this important road infrastructure in Morocco.},

  abstract={This paper investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile-edge computing (MEC) system, in which the UAV provides complementary computation resource to the terrestrial MEC system. The UAV processes the received computation tasks from the mobile users (MUs) by creating the corresponding virtual machines. Due to finite shared I/O resource of the UAV in the MEC system, each MU competes to schedule local as well as remote task computations across the decision epochs, aiming to maximize the expected long-term computation performance. The non-cooperative interactions among the MUs are modeled as a stochastic game, in which the decision makings of a MU depend on the global state statistics and the task scheduling policies of all MUs are coupled. To approximate the Nash equilibrium solutions, we propose a proactive scheme based on the long short-term memory and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. A digital twin of the MEC system is established to train the proactive DRL scheme offline. Using the proposed scheme, each MU makes task scheduling decisions only with its own information. Numerical experiments show a significant performance gain from the scheme in terms of average utility per MU across the decision epochs.},

  abstract={Agriculture is facing a period of unprecedented change resulting from the requirement to feed c. 10 billion mouths by 2050, while operating in a challenging business environment with increasing sustainability and consumer expectations. To meet these challenges many are looking to industry 4.0 technology as a solution, specifically the combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and in-field robotics. Although there have been successful prototypes from a functional perspective and promising start-ups, the complex nature of the agriculture system of systems creates a significant risk of mass adoption failure. The main risk stems from the majority of the hundreds of products being designed in isolation using closed hardware and software systems that are all aiming to serve the one farmer or grower. The current silo’d technology adoption approach is heading towards problems with usability, availability, viability, interoperability and adaptability. This paper proposes a new time constrained System of Systems (SoS) discovery process and supporting SoS Canvas, developed with the objective of increasing the adoption of SoS principles with non-technical stakeholders. The time constrained SoS discovery process consists of raising awareness, capturing data, modelling the SoS, modelling the System of Interest (SoI) and providing recommendations, often based on common challenges and opportunities from the SoS Canvas. The outcome of this initial case study prototyping the process, is a set of SysML diagrams demonstrating how the constituent systems currently contribute to emergent properties and recommendations to improve both the SoI and the SoS. Future research will focus on interoperability within agricultural technology (Agritech) and the potential for a SoS level digital twin, providing the capability to manage and optimise emergent properties for the betterment of all.},

  abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems are becoming more autonomous, interconnected, complex and adaptive, and are expected to operate in highly dynamic environments. This is especially challenging for energy ecosystems that are increasingly difficult to control and maintain as the number of participating manufacturers and users grows. Digital Twins help analyze and predict these systems in the form of digital reflections that operate in parallel with the physical system. In this paper, we use Machine Learning to improve the predictive power of Digital Twins for Cyber-Physical Energy Systems. Specifically, we use a Temporal Convolutional Neural Network model to learn the temporal patterns in the system and predict its responsiveness to specific power setpoint instructions. Real-life data from ten batteries were used to predict the behavior over time. Compared to the baseline model that uses the prior probability of response and the average response rate within the configured time window, the model predicts the batteries’ responsiveness more accurately. The more temporal information is used as input for prediction, the better the model performs in both precision and recall. The results show that this compensates for the lack of information when fewer metrics are used. The use of Machine Learning for Digital Twins can help maintain a heterogeneous energy ecosystem, while minimizing the need to acquire or disclose detailed information.},

Despite recent advances in important domains such as device health maintenance and manufacturing process, the conventional architecture does not offer a satisfactory solution for rapidly providing data models, a set of analytics or algorithms, and knowledge. In this work, we employ ideas from distributed network based on digital twins and from recent advances that augment artificial intelligent with big data. Our architecture provides a paradigm that uses a distributed network makes computer programming, software, and data spread out across more than one terminal, but communicate complex messages through terminal nodes, and are dependent upon each other, obviating the pressure from master station. We demonstrate the usefulness of digital twins that are used to track the performance of devices such as transformer during normal operation to detect possible defects and fix them before they result in failure. We also conclude that using digital twin technology will understand, predict, and optimize performance in order to achieve improved business outcomes, and apply machine learning and knowledge to predict the future.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks are capable of learning powerful representation, but often limited by heavy network architectures and high computational cost. Knowledge distillation (KD) is one of the effective ways to perform model compression and inference acceleration. But the final student models remain parameter redundancy. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel approach, called Variational Bayesian Group-level Sparsification for Knowledge Distillation (VBGS-KD), to distill a large teacher network into a small and sparse student network while preserving accuracy. We impose the sparsity-inducing prior on the groups of parameters in the student model, and introduce the variational Bayesian approximation to learn structural sparseness, which can effectively prune most part of weights. The prune threshold is learned during training without extra fine-tuning. The proposed method can learn the robust student networks that have achieved satisifying accuracy and compact sizes compared with the state-of-the-arts methods. We have validated our method on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, observing 90.3% sparsity with 0.19% accuracy boosting in MNIST. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={A Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) is a type of engineering diagram that uses symbols, text, and lines to represent the components and flow of an industrial process. Although used universally across industries such as manufacturing and oil & gas, P&IDs are usually trapped in image files with limited metadata, making their contents unsearchable and siloed from operational or enterprise systems. In order to extract the information contained in these diagrams, we propose a pipeline for automatically digitizing P&IDs. Our pipeline combines a series of computer vision techniques to detect symbols in a diagram, match symbols with associated text, and detect connections between symbols through lines. For the symbol detection task, we train a Convolutional Neural Network to classify certain common symbols with over 90% precision and recall. To detect connections between symbols, we use a graph search approach to traverse a diagram through its lines and discover interconnected symbols. By transforming unstructured diagrams into structured information, our pipeline enables applications such as diagram search, equipment-to-sensor mapping, and asset hierarchy creation. When integrated with operational and enterprise data, the extracted asset hierarchy serves as the foundation for a facility-wide digital twin, enabling advanced applications such as machine learning-based predictive maintenance.},

In the second part, the students use the dedicated software environment to edit projects on their own, and at this point the PBL approach is used. This method enables students to self-organize their learning process and take an active part in the seminar. The idea for the seminar and virtual teaching lab evolved from the industrial use case of testing software for programmable logic controllers (PLCs) without the real machine, using virtual commissioning (VC). The primary effort of VC lies in the manual creation of a digital representation of each mechatronic component providing the same behavior seen from PLC perspective. Students are taught to do this, create the so-called digital twin (DT).},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={A real world Industrial IoT set up has paved way for simultaneous monitoring of several sensors at their unique sampling rates. This has realized the need for artificial intelligence tools for robust data processing. However, the large size of input data requires real time monitoring and synchronization for online analysis. As the star concept behind the Industry 4.0 wave, a digital twin is a virtual, multi-scale and probabilistic simulation to mirror the performance of its physical counterpart and serve the product lifecycle in a virtual space. Evidently, a digital twin can proactively identify potential issues with its corresponding real twin. Thus, it is best suited for enabling a physics-based and data-driven model fusion to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the components. Traditional RUL prediction approaches have assumed either an exponential or linear degradation trend with a fixed curve shape to build a Health Index (HI) model. Such an assumption may not be useful for multi-sensor systems or cases where sensor data is available intermittently. A common constraint in the industry is irregular sensor data collection. The resulting asynchronous time series of the sporadic data needs to be an accurate representation of the component's HI when constructing a degradation model. In this paper, we extend the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique to generate RUL prediction within a digital twin framework as a means of synchronization with changing operational states. More specifically, we first use LSTM encoder-decoder (LSTM-ED) to train a multilayered neural network and reconstruct the sensor data time series corresponding to a healthy state. The resulting reconstruction error can be used to capture patterns in input data time series and estimate HI of training and testing sets. Using a time lag to record similarity between the HI curves, a weighted average of the final RUL estimation is obtained. The described empirical approach is evaluated on publicly available engine degradation dataset with run-to-failure information. Results indicate a high RUL estimation accuracy with greater error reduction rate. This demonstrates wide applicability of the discussed methodology to various industries where event data is scarce for the application of only data-driven techniques.},

  abstract={In adaptive learning system, the key to promote personalized learning is the learner model. The Elo model has great potential in online learning environment, so based on it, we propose the EELO which is an improved extension of Elo rating system, in view of polychotomously scored items and different granularity evaluations that the Elo rating system do not cover. The performance of the EELO estimating learners' abilities and predicting their future performances are evaluated on two large data set, which demonstrates that the EELO is better-performing. Then, we apply it in a real online learning environment to provide an analysis report for different user roles, which also can be used as the reference for the development of adaptive learning applications in the future.},

  abstract={While the Open Learner Model (OLM) is often mentioned to be an educational tool supporting the learning process (chiefly, activities such as planning, self-monitoring, and reflection), there is a need for theorising OLMs as an educational tool. More specifically, this means 1) to theorise what it is educationally meaningful; 2) see how the different characteristics of the tool (e.g. features, types, etc.) mediate the learning process in the light of theory deployed; and 3) empirically determine the conditions under which such mediation is educationally successful. As a case in point, we performed a literature review to investigate how studies using OLMs have deployed self-regulated learning. The results show that the theorisation of OLMs as an educational tool remained rather fragmented and occasional.},

  abstract={As poor student engagement with online learning remains an open issue, this research aims to assess the impact that scrutable and controllable open learner models have on enhancing student engagement. This paper presents personalized visual narratives that display the learner's engagement with his/her course content, the time spent on course tasks, resources used, and peer comparisons. The visual narratives include the student's learner model which presents his/her performance and development to date and supports visual scrutinization. It also enables the student to challenge his/her system calculated knowledge levels.

  abstract={With increasing ethical and legal concerns on privacy for deep models in visual recognition, differential privacy has emerged as a mechanism to disguise membership of sensitive data in training datasets. Recent methods like Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) leverage a large ensemble of teacher models trained on disjoint subsets of private data, to transfer knowledge to a student model with privacy guarantees. However, labeled vision data is often expensive and datasets, when split into many disjoint training sets, lead to significantly sub-optimal accuracy and thus hardly sustain good privacy bounds. We propose a practically data-efficient scheme based on private release of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) queries, which altogether avoids splitting the training dataset. Our approach allows the use of privacy-amplification by subsampling and iterative refinement of the kNN feature embedding. We rigorously analyze the theoretical properties of our method and demonstrate strong experimental performance on practical computer vision datasets for face attribute recognition and person reidentification. In particular, we achieve comparable or better accuracy than PATE while reducing more than 90% of the privacy loss, thereby providing the “most practical method to-date” for private deep learning in computer vision.},

  pages={7536-7545},
  abstract={Standard Knowledge Distillation (KD) approaches distill the knowledge of a cumbersome teacher model into the parameters of a student model with a pre-defined architecture. However, the knowledge of a neural network, which is represented by the network's output distribution conditioned on its input, depends not only on its parameters but also on its architecture. Hence, a more generalized approach for KD is to distill the teacher's knowledge into both the parameters and architecture of the student. To achieve this, we present a new \textit{Architecture-aware Knowledge Distillation (AKD)} approach that finds student models (pearls for the teacher) that are best for distilling the given teacher model. In particular, we leverage Neural Architecture Search (NAS), equipped with our KD-guided reward, to search for the best student architectures for a given teacher. Experimental results show our proposed AKD consistently outperforms the conventional NAS plus KD approach, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet classification task under various latency settings. Furthermore, the best AKD student architecture for the ImageNet classification task also transfers well to other tasks such as million level face recognition and ensemble learning.},

  abstract={Adversarial perturbations are imperceptible changes to input pixels that can change the prediction of deep learning models. Learned weights of models robust to such perturbations are previously found to be transferable across different tasks but this applies only if the model architecture for the source and target tasks is the same. Input gradients characterize how small changes at each input pixel affect the model output. Using only natural images, we show here that training a student model's input gradients to match those of a robust teacher model can gain robustness close to a strong baseline that is robustly trained from scratch. Through experiments in MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, we show that our proposed method, input gradient adversarial matching, can transfer robustness across different tasks and even across different model architectures. This demonstrates that directly targeting the semantics of input gradients is a feasible way towards adversarial robustness.},

  abstract={Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods are capable of transferring the knowledge encoded in a large and complex teacher into a smaller and faster student. Early methods were usually limited to transferring the knowledge only between the last layers of the networks, while latter approaches were capable of performing multi-layer KD, further increasing the accuracy of the student. However, despite their improved performance, these methods still suffer from several limitations that restrict both their efficiency and flexibility. First, existing KD methods typically ignore that neural networks undergo through different learning phases during the training process, which often requires different types of supervision for each one. Furthermore, existing multi-layer KD methods are usually unable to effectively handle networks with significantly different architectures (heterogeneous KD). In this paper we propose a novel KD method that works by modeling the information flow through the various layers of the teacher model and then train a student model to mimic this information flow. The proposed method is capable of overcoming the aforementioned limitations by using an appropriate supervision scheme during the different phases of the training process, as well as by designing and training an appropriate auxiliary teacher model that acts as a proxy model capable of “explaining” the way the teacher works to the student. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using four image datasets and several different evaluation setups.},

  abstract={We present a simple self-training method that achieves 88.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which is 2.0% better than the state-of-the-art model that requires 3.5B weakly labeled Instagram images. On robustness test sets, it improves ImageNet-A top-1 accuracy from 61.0% to 83.7%, reduces ImageNet-C mean corruption error from 45.7 to 28.3, and reduces ImageNet-P mean flip rate from 27.8 to 12.2. To achieve this result, we first train an EfficientNet model on labeled ImageNet images and use it as a teacher to generate pseudo labels on 300M unlabeled images. We then train a larger EfficientNet as a student model on the combination of labeled and pseudo labeled images. We iterate this process by putting back the student as the teacher. During the generation of the pseudo labels, the teacher is not noised so that the pseudo labels are as accurate as possible. However, during the learning of the student, we inject noise such as dropout, stochastic depth and data augmentation via RandAugment to the student so that the student generalizes better than the teacher.},

  number={10},
  pages={12240-12251},
  abstract={6G is envisioned to empower wireless communication and computation through the digitalization and connectivity of everything, by establishing a digital representation of the real network environment. Mobile edge computing (MEC), as one of the key enabling factors, meets unprecedented challenges during mobile offloading due to the extremely complicated and unpredictable network environment in 6G. The existing works on offloading in MEC mainly ignore the effects of user mobility and the unpredictable MEC environment. In this paper, we present a new vision of Digital Twin Edge Networks (DITEN) where digital twins (DTs) of edge servers estimate edge servers' states and DT of the entire MEC system provides training data for offloading decision. A mobile offloading scheme is proposed in DITEN to minimize the offloading latency under the constraints of accumulated consumed service migration cost during user mobility. The Lyapunov optimization method is leveraged to simplify the long-term migration cost constraint to a multi-objective dynamic optimization problem, which is then solved by Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning. Simulations results show that our proposed scheme effectively diminishes the average offloading latency, the offloading failure rate, and the service migration rate, as compared with benchmark schemes, while saving the system cost with DT assistance.},

  abstract={Compressing deep neural network (DNN) models becomes a very important and necessary technique for real-world applications, such as deploying those models on mobile devices. Knowledge distillation is one of the most popular methods for model compression, and many studies have been made on developing this technique. However, those studies mainly focused on classification problems, and very few attempts have been made on regression problems, although there are many application of DNNs on regression problems. In this paper, we propose a new formalism of knowledge distillation for regression problems. First, we propose a new loss function, teacher outlier rejection loss, which rejects outliers in training samples using teacher model predictions. Second, we consider a multi-task network with two outputs: one estimates training labels which is in general contaminated by noisy labels; And the other estimates teacher model's output which is expected to modify the noise labels following the memorization effects. By considering the multi-task network, training of the feature extraction of student models becomes more effective, and it allows us to obtain a better student model than one trained from scratch. We performed comprehensive evaluation with one simple toy model: sinusoidal function, and two open datasets: MPIIGaze, and Multi-PIE. Our results show consistent improvement in accuracy regardless of the annotation error level in the datasets.},

  abstract={Medical segmentation is a significant task since it provides valuable information for diagnosis. In the recent years, convolutional neural networks have achieved great success in this field. However, the number of medical images is often limited which cannot support large networks to be trained. Thus, overfitting is much more common in medical images than other tasks. Also, to get annotated images is very costly and time-consuming. We stimulate an extreme condition where the number of the sample is so limited that we adopt a Mean Teacher Model to avoid overfitting. We build two models - student and teacher, with same structure and alternatively trained. We apply consistency loss to update the parameters of student and use Exponential Moving Average to compute parameters of teacher from student model.

  abstract={With successful applications of deep feature learning algorithms, spoken language identification (LID) on long utterances obtains satisfactory performance. However, the performance on short utterances is drastically degraded even when the LID system is trained using short utterances. The main reason is due to the large variation of the representation on short utterances which results in high model confusion. To narrow the performance gap between long, and short utterances, we proposed a teacher-student representation learning framework based on a knowledge distillation method to improve LID performance on short utterances. In the proposed framework, in addition to training the student model on short utterances with their true labels, the internal representation from the output of a hidden layer of the student model is supervised with the representation corresponding to their longer utterances. By reducing the distance of internal representations between short, and long utterances, the student model can explore robust discriminative representations for short utterances, which is expected to reduce model confusion. We conducted experiments on our in-house LID dataset, and NIST LRE07 dataset, and showed the effectiveness of the proposed methods for short utterance LID tasks.},

  abstract={Many enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 (Internet of Things “IoT”, Cloud systems, Big Data Analytics) contribute to the creation of what is the Digital Twin or virtual twin of a physical process, that is a mathematical model capable of describing the process, product or service in a precise way in order to carry out analyses and apply strategies. Digital Twin models integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and analytics software with the data collected from the production plants to create digital simulation models that update when the parameters of the production processes or the working conditions change. This is a self-learning mechanism, which makes use of data collected from various sources (sensors that transmit operating conditions; experts, such as engineers with deep knowledge of the industrial domain; other similar machines or fleets of similar machines) and integrates also historical data relating to the past use of the machine. Starting from the virtual twin vision, simulation plays a key role within the Industry 4.0 transformation. Creating a virtual prototype has become necessary and strategic to raise the safety levels of the operators engaged in the maintenance phases, but above all the integration of the digital model with the IoT has become particularly effective, as the advent of software platforms offers the possibility of integrating real-time data with all the digital information that a company owns on a given process, ensuring the realization of the Digital Twin. In this context, this work aims at developing optimized solutions for application in a beverage pasteurization system using the Digital Twin approach, capable of creating a virtual modelling of the process and preventing high-risk events for operators.},

  abstract={In the era of Industry 4.0, Digital Twins (DTs) pave the way for the creation of the Cognitive Factory. By virtualizing and twinning information stemming from the real and the digital world, it is now possible to connect all parts of the production process by having virtual copies of physical elements interacting with each other in the digital and physical realms. However, this alone does not imply cognition. Cognition requires modelling not only the physical characteristics but also the behavior of production elements and processes. The latter can be founded upon data-driven models produced via Data Analytics and Machine Learning techniques, giving rise to the so-called Cognitive (Digital) Twin. To further enable the Cognitive Factory, a novel concept, dubbed as Enhanced Cognitive Twin (ECT), is proposed in this paper as a way to introduce advanced cognitive capabilities to the DT artefact that enable supporting decisions, with the end goal to enable DTs to react to inner or outer stimuli. The Enhanced Cognitive Twin can be deployed at different hierarchical levels of the production process, i.e., at sensor-, machine-, process-, employee- or even factory-level, aggregated to allow both horizontal and vertical interplay. The ECT notion is proposed in the context of process industries, where cognition is particularly important due to the continuous, non-linear, and varied nature of the respective production processes.},

One recurrent challenge of the industrial sector is to evaluate multiple scenarios to make decisions at different levels of the business model. Innovative technologies and tools are used to provide solutions to existing gaps in current manufacturing systems. The evaluation of scenarios is used to manage risks, costs, prepare for upcoming work and forecast demand. Thus, the use of Digital Twin (DT) has proven its value covering the simulation and creation of virtual environments without the physical investment needed. With emergent technologies comes to a great responsibility for institutes to prepare undergraduate students in the development of novel skills, thus, technologies should be adapted and included into the teaching-learning process to aid the adoption from educational to the industrial sector. In this work, it is shown how the adoption of DT has been used to teach industrial concepts such as the automation pyramid, the programming of programmable logic controllers PLC and the exchange of information through industrial networks along with the concepts that constitute digital twins, such as digital master, digital shadow and modelling through system dynamics. Besides, the general vision of how digitalization is understood aligned to the vision of education 4.0 and applied to teach a tool to reduce the time for decision making into the industrial sector.},

  abstract={As one of the key technologies for realizing a fully digitalized world, the Internet of Things (IoT) requires ubiquitous connections across both land and sea. However, due to lack of infrastructure such as optical fibers and base stations, maritime communications inevitably face a highly complex and heterogeneous environment, which greatly challenges the connection reliability and traffic steering efficiency for future service-oriented maritime IoT. With the recent burgeoning application of artificial intelligence (AI) in many fields, an AI-empowered autonomous network for maritime IoT is envisioned as a promising solution. However, AI typically involves training/learning processes, which require realistic data/environment in order to obtain valuable outcomes. To this end, this article proposes the parallel network, which can be regarded as the "digital twin" of the real network and is responsible for realizing four key functionalities: self-learning and optimizing, state inference and network cognition, event prediction and anomaly detection, and knowledge database and snapshots. We then explain how various AI methods can facilitate the operation of the parallel- network-driven maritime network. A case study is provided to demonstrate the idea.

Especially, the skill of predicting human internal state is a field of great interest in many applications, including video surveillance, behavior analysis, human robot interaction, life-logging. While accurately predicting these technologies (e.g. emotion, confident for talking a topic) could have benefits for many fields, generic machine learning systems still yield low performance in some situation. We hypothesize that these sophisticated models suffer from individual differences of human's personality. Therefore, we proposed a multi characteristic model architecture which combines the personalized machine learning models and utilize each model's prediction score in the inference. This architecture formed with reference to ensemble machine learning architecture. In this research, we focus on a similarity between new user and trained user model by using the idea of applicability domain of machine learning models. In the empirical result, we confirmed that data distribution (one way of checking applicability domain) of each user model correspond to the performance of models and we estimated confidence during communication as a human internal state.},

  abstract={In recent years, deep learning has spread rapidly, and deeper, larger models have been proposed. However, the calculation cost becomes enormous as the size of the models becomes larger. Various techniques for compressing the size of the models have been proposed to improve performance while reducing computational costs. One of the methods to compress the size of the models is knowledge distillation (KD). Knowledge distillation is a technique for transferring knowledge of deep or ensemble models with many parameters (teacher model) to smaller shallow models (student model). Since the purpose of knowledge distillation is to increase the similarity between the teacher model and the student model, we propose to introduce the concept of metric learning into knowledge distillation to make the student model closer to the teacher model using pairs or triplets of the training samples. In metric learning, the researchers are developing the methods to build a model that can increase the similarity of outputs for similar samples. Metric learning aims at reducing the distance between similar and increasing the distance between dissimilar. The functionality of the metric learning to reduce the differences between similar outputs can be used for the knowledge distillation to reduce the differences between the outputs of the teacher model and the student model. Since the outputs of the teacher model for different objects are usually different, the student model needs to distinguish them. We think that metric learning can clarify the difference between the different outputs, and the performance of the student model could be improved. We have performed experiments to compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods. The results show that the student model obtained by the proposed method gives higher performance than the conventional knowledge distillation methods.},

  abstract={Currently, the divergence in distributions of design and operational data, and large computational complexity are limiting factors in the adoption of CNNs in real-world applications. For instance, person re-identification systems typically rely on a distributed set of cameras, where each camera has different capture conditions. This can translate to a considerable shift between source (e.g. lab setting) and target (e.g. operational camera) domains. Given the cost of annotating image data captured for fine-tuning in each target domain, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has become a popular approach to adapt CNNs. Moreover, state-of-the-art deep learning models that provide a high level of accuracy often rely on architectures that are too complex for real-time applications. Although several compression and UDA approaches have recently been proposed to overcome these limitations, they do not allow optimizing a CNN to simultaneously address both. In this paper, we propose an unexplored direction - the joint optimization of CNNs to provide a compressed model that is adapted to perform well for a given target domain. In particular, the proposed approach performs unsupervised knowledge distillation (KD) from a complex teacher model to a compact student model, by leveraging both source and target data. It also improves upon existing UDA techniques by progressively teaching the student about domain-invariant features, instead of directly adapting a compact model on target domain data. Our method is compared against state-of-the-art compression and UDA techniques, using two popular classification datasets for UDA - Office31 and ImageClef-DA. In both datasets, results indicate that our method can achieve the highest level of accuracy while requiring a comparable or lower time complexity.},

  abstract={Probabilistic Knowledge Transfer (PKT) aims to transfer the knowledge encoded in the representations extracted from a layer of a large and complex neural network (teacher) into a smaller and faster one (student). However, PKT only transfers the knowledge between two layers of the networks, ignoring the potentially useful information encoded by the previous ones, reducing in this way the efficiency of PKT and the performance of the student model. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient multilayer PKT method that is capable of transferring the knowledge between the student and teacher networks by employing the representations extracted from multiple layers. The ability of the proposed multilayer PKT method to improve the knowledge transfer and increase the performance of the student model over other state-of-the-art methods is demonstrated using two image datasets.},

  abstract={In order to enable changeable production of Industry 4.0 applications, a production system should respond to unpredictable changes quickly and adequately. This requires process planning to be performed based on the real time operating conditions and dynamic changes to be handled with cognitive skills. To meet this demand, we present a process planning approach using digital twins and reinforcement learning to derive near-optimal process plans. The digital twins enable access to real-time information about the production system. They also constitute the environment for training the agent of the reinforcement learning method. The environment works as a virtual plant, containing the attributes of the product and resources, and uses simulation models of the resources to calculate the reward for an action in terms of reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning enables our approach to derive process plans via trial and error. Besides the virtual plant, our approach has a planner, which plays the role of the agent to derive near-optimal plans by trying different actions in the virtual plant, and observes the rewards. We apply the Q-learning algorithm to derive near optimal process plans. The evaluation results show that our approach is able to derive near-optimal process plans for different problem sizes. The evaluation also demonstrated the planner’s ability to identify by itself which action to take in which situation. Consequently, no modeling of the preconditions and effects of the actions is necessary.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) is a promising technology for in-memory computing with high storage density, fast inference, and good compatibility with CMOS. However, the mapping of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) model on RRAM suffers from realistic device issues, especially the variation and quantization error, resulting in a significant reduction in inference accuracy. In this work, we first extract these statistical properties from 65 nm RRAM data on 300mm wafers. The RRAM data present 10-levels in quantization and 50% variance, resulting in an accuracy drop to 31.76% and 10.49% for MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Based on the experimental data, we propose a combination of machine learning algorithms and on-line adaptation to recover the accuracy with the minimum overhead. The recipe first applies Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer an ideal model into a student model with statistical variations and 10 levels. Furthermore, an on-line sparse adaptation (OSA) method is applied to the DNN model mapped on to the RRAM array. Using importance sampling, OSA adds a small SRAM array that is sparsely connected to the main RRAM array; only this SRAM array is updated to recover the accuracy. As demonstrated on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, a 7.86% area cost is sufficient to achieve baseline accuracy for the 65 nm RRAM devices.},

It provides a flexible, modular, and scalable implementation to ensure large-scale, city-wide experimentation with a moderate computational cost. The defining feature of our Digital Twin is a unique architecture allowing for submission of sequential queries, to which the Digital Twin provides instantaneous responses with the "state of the world", and hence is an Oracle.

  abstract={Internet of things (IoT) devices are prone to attacks due to the limitation of their privacy and security components. These attacks vary from exploiting backdoors to disrupting the communication network of the devices. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play an essential role in ensuring information privacy and security of IoT devices against these attacks. Recently, deep learning-based IDS techniques are becoming more prominent due to their high classification accuracy. However, conventional deep learning techniques jeopardize user privacy due to the transfer of user data to a centralized server. Federated learning (FL) is a popular privacy-preserving decentralized learning method. FL enables training models locally at the edge devices and transferring local models to a centralized server instead of transferring sensitive data. Nevertheless, FL can suffer from reverse engineering ML attacks that can learn information about the user's data from model. To overcome the problem of reverse engineering, mimic learning is another way to preserve the privacy of ML-based IDS. In mimic learning, a student model is trained with the public dataset, which is labeled with the teacher model that is trained by sensitive user data. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines the advantages of FL and mimic learning, namely federated mimic learning to create a distributed IDS while minimizing the risk of jeopardizing users' privacy, and benchmark its performance compared to other ML-based IDS techniques using NSL-KDD dataset. Our results show that we can achieve 98.11% detection accuracy with federated mimic learning.},

  abstract={As a key service of the future 6G network, healthcare digital twin is the virtual replica of a person, which employs Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and AI-powered models to predict the state of health and provide suggestions to a range of clinical questions. To support healthcare digital twins, the right cyber resilience technologies and policies must be applied and maintained to preserve cyber resilience. Vulnerability detection is a fundamental technology for cyber resilience in healthcare digital twins. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been applied to address the limitations of traditional machine learning in vulnerability detection. However, it is important to consider code context relationships and pay attention on the vulnerability related keywords for searching an IoT vulnerability in healthcare digital twins. Due to massive software and complexity of healthcare digital twin, a full automatic solution is really needed for assisting cyber resilience check in the real-world scenarios. This article presents a novel scheme for recognising potential vulnerable functions to support healthcare digital twins. We develop a new deep neural model to capture bi-directional context relationships among the risky code keywords. A number of well-designed experiments are carried out on a large ground truth, which consists of tens of thousands of vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions from IoT related software. The results show our new scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art DL-based methods for vulnerability detection.},

  abstract={Vienna, among other cities, has the aspirations of transforming into a smart city of tomorrow. To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of the derived models for thermal rating calculation are indicated by comparison to the analytical method given by the IEC 60287 on an example. Accurate mathematical models with real time calculation capabilities and prediction accuracies in the range of 98 to 99% could be derived on the basis of relatively small data sets and implementation of external data.},

However, the applicability of map generated by SOM has not yet been discussed. This paper suggests a procedure how to improve a map generated by SOM algorithm. It shows that if the hammering sound of a piece is mapped on the boundary between the areas corresponding to defected and non-defected products, the map cannot be applied to inspect this piece and another map must be generated by repeating the training including the hammering sounds of such pieces by SOM algorithm. By executing the procedure some number of times, it is likely that the improved map will be used for hammering sound inspection.},

As a result, the motor for cutting lawn grasses is running with constant rotation speed from the beginning to the end of operation of robotic lawn mower. In order to precisely control the rotation speed of motor, the lawn grass lengths and ground conditions are estimated by using the effective sensor data.

  pages={201236-201246},
  abstract={Mixed dish, which mixes different types of dishes in one plate, is a popular kind of food in East and Southeast Asia. Identifying the dish type in the mixed dish is essential for dietary tracking, which gains increasing research attention recently. Nevertheless, mixed dish detection is a challenging task because of large visual variances among dishes in different canteens, which is known as the domain shifting problem. Since collecting and annotating sufficient training samples in each canteen for model training is difficult, a more practical way is developing detection models that can adapt quickly to cross-canteen mixed-dish detection with less supervision information. To this end, we propose a novel framework called Weakly-supervised Mean Teacher Network (WMT-Net) that addresses this specific detection task in a weakly supervised manner, where bounding box annotations are not required in the target domain. The proposed WMT-Net constructs Mean Teacher learning by maintaining the image-level consistency between teacher and student modules. Specifically, WMT-Net firstly learns instance-level information from the source dataset in a fully supervised fashion for the student model. Then the whole architecture is optimized with weakly supervised learning: 1) weakly supervised training in student model to reduce the domain gap in global semantics between source data and target data, 2) image-level consistency to align the image-level predictions between teacher model and student model. Experimental results on mixed-dish dataset show that even the proposed WMT-Net is trained in a weakly supervised fashion on the target domain, the performances attained by WMT-Net are very close to the model trained in a fully supervised fashion, which verify the effectiveness of WMT-Net. In addition, the proposed WMT-Net also achieves 44.6% mAP on Pascal VOC to Clipart cross-domain detection, which improves 7.2% mAP compared with the state-of-the-arts method and further demonstrates its generalization capabilities.},

Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) provides a feasible way to realize realtime personalized learning guidance and resource recommendations by applying AI to capture and analyze online learners' characteristics and behaviors. In this paper, reviews and trends of ITS are discussed and three challenges of ITS research &development are pointed out: learner model, guidance mechanism and human-computer interaction mechanism. In order to address these issues, parallel intelligence theory is introduced and a parallel intelligence education based ITS framework is proposed.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all the spheres human activities. The problems related with the forced self-isolation of people, closed borders between the countries as well as within the states push towards digitalization opening opportunities for bringing new technologies into everyday life. The paper focuses on the resulting dramatic changes in engineering education due to the current classical learning process paradigm shift. The brief overview of the problems is presented. The main challenge is to teach the future engineers to work with and to operate real hardware not available at home. The implementation of a Digital Twin concept for industrial equipment can partially solve the emerged problem related with hardware unavailability by the remote learning process as well as to improve the professional training quality as the pandemic is over.},

The data flow on spatial characteristics of vehicles is simulated using a special simulation model. A distinguishing feature of the model is the ability to describe and reproduce specific scenarios related to critical situations in the transport network that require the involvement of a centralized control system. It is assumed that in the early stages of using the Digital Twin, the role of the control system can be performed by a user who has the sufficient skills in traffic control. User decisions are stored in the Digital Twin's memory and can be used later to train a control system based on machine learning.},

  abstract={The paper presents a model for smart control of large scale manufacturing systems, in which pools of shop floor and computing resources are shared in a dual cloud pattern. The proposed architecture uses the holonic manufacturing paradigm by decoupling the decision layer from the control one. The decision layer uses intelligent agents that reconfigure optimally in real time the resource allocation and scheduling of operations on products at batch level; also, the resource health is monitored continuously. Decisions are taken in the high layer of the MES based on real time machine learning algorithms that predict resource performances and QoS influencing usage costs, classify and cluster resource states to predict anomalies in behaviours and prevent resource failures. The distributed control layer keeps reality awareness during production by using digital twins replicated for all resources. Data is collected in real time streams from physical resource and process twins, aggregated in time series and sent to the intelligent agents in the cloud without delaying production. Experiments discuss the forecast of abnormal pick-and-place robot operations.},

This paper presents a virtual commissioning digital twin model for the modularized automatic assembly system running in our lab. First, the Siemens NX MCD software tool is used to develop the virtual commissioning digital twin model for the system. Then the different working scenarios are simulated and implemented in the virtual physical simulation environment. The data from the proposed virtual commissioning digital twin model is collected and trained with 6 different machine learning algorithm such as Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The advantage of our newly developed virtual commissioning model is that it is able to simulate different working conditions without risk and cost-free. It is also convenient to mimic the worsening working status and failed operation scenarios which need long time to collect for the real system. We use the collected data as input for the machine learning to implement the system monitoring and predicting. The machine learning results for 6 learning algorithms are presented and it shows the possibilities and advantages of our proposed virtual commissioning digital twin model.},

  abstract={Cyber-physical systems revolve around context awareness, empowering objective-oriented services, products and operations based on real data. Self-aware and self-control systems are core elements in the Industry 4.0 framework towards self-sustainable adaptive manufacturing and personalized services. This development is witnessed by the context-aware pervasive assistance to users and machines in decisions making process for optimizing product performance and economic yield. While integration of the virtual and the physical world entails smart sensors communication and complex data analytics, it relies on artificial intelligence tools to manage process operations. The objective of the article is to create awareness that systems & control community must address theoretical and practical aspects from a larger perspective. Context aware control is emerging as a natural solution to maximize the use of available sensing instrumentation and the relatively low cost data logging, i.e. an important source for extracting information, interpreting and using context information and adapt its functionality to the current context of use. This article presents a concise overview of applications where context aware systems and control methodologies are relevant in the seven societal challenges acknowledged by European policy-makers: Digital Society; Food; Health and Well-Being; Smart Resource Management; Urban Planning, Mobility Dynamics and Logistics; New Energy Demand and Delivery; and Society.},

The speech production can be significantly affected when the speaker wears a face mask. The task evaluates the systems for the classification of speech recordings with and without a surgical mask. A student-teacher deep-learning neural network is proposed inspired by the well-performed consistency learning method on a lot of classification problems. In particular, the consistency regularization term is designed between out-puts of the student model and the guided teacher model. Different level Gaussian noises are respectively added into the inputs of the teacher model as model perturbations to optimize the system robustness. To take further advantage of the consistency learning, a small number of unlabeled evaluation data is utilized to be combined with the labeled data for the system training in a semi-supervised learning manner. Finally, the proposed system achieves an unweighted average recall up to 72.50% on the official evaluation dataset, increasing by 10% compared with the baseline result of 62.60%.},

A distribution subsystem comprises a CPS (Cyber Physical System) where the Cyber part is enabled by a low latency IIoT network and computational resources at the edge (distribution grid subsystem controller) while the physical system is represented (Digital Twin) by a hybrid model of the grid: a data driven machine learning representation of a limited number of nodes, along with a discrete-time model-based transient state estimator which captures the near real time physical operation of the grid. In case of early warning measurements acquired through the IIoT, machine learning edge computations can detect the severity of the warning, identify the network area of interest while ignite the execution of the transient state estimation. The transient state estimation predicts the incoming failure in near real time while the timing window allows possible preventive actuation.},

An approach to this problem is digitization of agriculture through IT tools by creating digital twins.

Hence, this paper proposes a methodology to assign an identification marker to plants in a crop using an image analysis pipeline. To show the effectiveness of the algorithm the proposed method is evaluated on the Rovitis robotic platform and compared with the crop ontology. The outcome of this work can be used in robotic agricultural platforms to address plants singularly thus optimizing their cultivation.},

  abstract={To reduce the number of aircrafts on ground, the electrical design engineers are interested in predicting the oil temperature of the generator during a flight. Changes on the temperature value may indicate an incorrect functioning of the generator. An abnormal behavior can be identified by using machine learning algorithms trained on flights free from any anomalies to predict the generator oil temperature. These predictions can then be compared to the observed values, here the sensor data collected from the aircraft during flight. If the observed value is far from the predicted value, a failure warning is raised and a maintenance action shall be performed.In this paper, we build a digital twin of the electrical generator which predicts the oil generator temperature at a given time thanks to the history of features. We compare several machine learning algorithms and the most promising appears to be a neural network which was implemented as part of the electrical generator digital twin.The digital twin is tested by using real flight data containing generator failures and it is verified that the algorithm is able to detect an anomaly prior to the failure events (early failure detection).},

  abstract={Knowledge Distillation is one approach in Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to compress huge parameters and high level of computation associated with a teacher model to a smaller student model. Therefore, the smaller model can be deployed in embedded systems. Most of Knowledge Distillations transfer information at the last stage of the DNN model. We propose an efficient compression method that can be split into three parts. First, we propose a cross-layer Gramian matrix to extract more features from the teacher's model. Second, we adopt Kullback Leibler (KL) Divergence in an offline deep mutual learning (DML) environment to make the student model find a wider robust minimum. Finally, we propose the use of offline ensemble pre-trained teachers to teach a student model. With ResNet-32 as the teacher's model and ResNet-8 as the student's model, experimental results showed that Top-l accuracy increased by 4.38% with a 6. 11x compression rate and 5. 27x computation rate.},

  abstract={The complexity of global distribution networks in the automotive industry and likewise the number of disruptions significantly increased throughout the last years. In order to monitor relevant processes and to optimize decision-making in case of disruptions, a concept for a decision support system (DSS) was introduced. For this purpose, the distribution process weaknesses of the German premium automotive company BMW were identified. The method used was a Failure Mode and Effect Analysis with operational managers and relevant process partners interviews. Based on the findings, performance indicators, thresholds, early warnings and options for action were specified. A big data platform supports the processing of the growing number of relevant data in real-time. In the long-term decision-making can be automated using machine learning algorithms. This paper proves that negative impacts of disruptions can be minimized, and the robustness of the process improved by anticipating and identifying deviations beforehand and in real-time. Hence, companies save money while strengthening customer satisfaction. The DSS can be seen as a necessary precursor of a digital twin.},

We address two main challenges of learning the three tasks. First, most existing datasets are highly imbalanced. Second, most existing datasets do not contain labels for all three tasks. To tackle the first challenge, we apply data balancing techniques to experimental datasets. To tackle the second challenge, we propose an algorithm for the multitask model to learn from missing (incomplete) labels. This algorithm has two steps. We first train a teacher model to perform all three tasks, where each instance is trained by the ground truth label of its corresponding task. Secondly, we refer to the outputs of the teacher model as the soft labels. We use the soft labels and the ground truth to train the student model. We find that most of the student models outperform their teacher model on all the three tasks. Finally, we use model ensembling to boost performance further on the three tasks.

  abstract={Like the current digitalization process [1], digitalization in the Smart Home and Smart Building goes beyond seeing digital systems as individual elements or isolated solutions. In principle, solutions must be developed that enable comprehensive networking and barrier-free data exchange to support the numerous new application scenarios [2]. Nowadays, in a typical smart home, there exist a large number of miscellaneous devices and systems with different characteristics. Using their sensors and actuators, these devices and systems can form an interface to the real world and can make their measurements available in near real time. Furthermore, it is possible to provide a digital representation of an entire Smart Home or Building using a socalled Digital Twin. Digital Twins can not only represent the current state of the underlying systems, but also the history of the data for learning processes in a semantic context. Hence, they can provide interfaces to AI systems in a service environment. In this paper, we present an approach which uses the WoT Thing Description (TD) as standardized by the W3C [3] as the basis for the implementation of a novel Digital Twin for Smart Homes and Buildings. The use of the standardized TD model enables interoperability across manufacturers and devices. The goal is to make extended services more flexible and dynamic on the basis of semantic device type and building descriptions of Digital Twins.},

  pages={212-221},
  abstract={Relevance has significant impact on user experience and business profit for e-commerce search platform. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for search relevance prediction, by distilling knowledge from BERT and related multi-layer Transformer teacher models into simple feed-forward networks with large amount of unlabeled data. The distillation process produces a student model that recovers more than 97% test accuracy of teacher models on new queries, at a serving cost that's several magnitude lower (latency 150x lower than BERT-Base and 15x lower than the most efficient BERT variant, TinyBERT). The applications of temperature rescaling and teacher model stacking further boost model accuracy, without increasing the student model complexity. We present experimental results on both in-house e-commerce search relevance data as well as a public data set on sentiment analysis from the GLUE benchmark. The latter takes advantage of another related public data set of much larger scale, while disregarding its potentially noisy labels. Embedding analysis and case study on the in-house data further highlight the strength of the resulting model. By making the data processing and model training source code public, we hope the techniques presented here can help reduce energy consumption of the state of the art Transformer models and also level the playing field for small organizations lacking access to cutting edge machine learning hardwares.},

  abstract={Data-efficient domain adaptation with only a few labelled data is desired for many robotic applications, e.g., in grasping detection, the inference skill learned from a grasping dataset is not universal enough to directly apply on various other daily/industrial applications. This paper presents an approach enabling the easy domain adaptation through a novel grasping detection network with confidence-driven semi-supervised learning, where these two components deeply interact with each other. The proposed grasping detection network specially provides a prediction uncertainty estimation mechanism by leveraging on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), and the mean-teacher semi-supervised learning utilizes such uncertainty information to emphasizing the consistency loss only for those unlabelled data with high confidence, which we referred it as the confidence-driven mean teacher. This approach largely prevents the student model to learn the incorrect/harmful information from the consistency loss, which speeds up the learning progress and improves the model accuracy. Our results show that the proposed network can achieve high success rate on the Cornell grasping dataset, and for domain adaptation with very limited data, the confidence- driven mean teacher outperforms the original mean teacher and direct training by more than 10% in evaluation loss especially for avoiding the overfitting and model diverging.},

  abstract={In this study, we present a dynamic graph representation learning model on weighted graphs to accurately predict the network capacity of connections between viewers in a live video streaming event. We propose EGAD, a neural network architecture to capture the graph evolution by introducing a self-attention mechanism on the weights between consecutive graph convolutional networks. In addition, we account for the fact that neural architectures require a huge amount of parameters to train, thus increasing the online inference latency and negatively influencing the user experience in a live video streaming event. To address the problem of the high online inference of a vast number of parameters, we propose a knowledge distillation strategy. In particular, we design a distillation loss function, aiming to first pretrain a teacher model on offline data, and then transfer the knowledge from the teacher to a smaller student model with less parameters. We evaluate our proposed model on the link prediction task on three real-world datasets, generated by live video streaming events. The events lasted 80 minutes and each viewer exploited the distribution solution provided by the company Hive Streaming AB. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of link prediction accuracy and number of required parameters, when evaluated against state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we study the distillation performance of the proposed model in terms of compression ratio for different distillation strategies, where we show that the proposed model can achieve a compression ratio up to 15:100, preserving high link prediction accuracy.

  pages={1103-1110},
  abstract={Deep learning models trained on large-scale data have achieved encouraging performance in many real-world tasks. Meanwhile, publishing those models trained on sensitive datasets, such as medical records, could pose serious privacy concerns. To counter these issues, one of the current state-of-the-art approaches is Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles, or PATE, which achieved promising results in preserving the utility of the model while providing a strong privacy guarantee. PATE combines an ensemble of "teacher models" trained on sensitive data and transfers the knowledge to a "student" model through the noisy aggregation of teachers' votes for labeling unlabeled public data which the student model will be trained on. However, the knowledge or voted labels learned by the student are noisy due to private aggregation. Learning directly from noisy labels can significantly impact the accuracy of the student model. In this paper, we propose the PATE++ mechanism, which combines the current advanced noisy label training mechanisms co-teaching(+) with the original PATE framework to enhance its accuracy. A novel structure of Generative Adversarial Nets with one generator and two discriminators is developed in order to integrate them effectively. Furthermore, we discuss the intrinsic limitations of the "update-by-disagreement" method in the co-teaching+ mechanism and develop a novel noisy label detection mechanism for semi-supervised model training to further improve student model performance when training with noisy labels. We evaluate our method on Fashion-MNIST and SVHN to show the improvements on the original PATE on all measures.},

  abstract={Dynamic graph representation learning strategies are based on different neural architectures to capture the graph evolution over time. However, the underlying neural architectures require a large amount of parameters to train and suffer from high online inference latency, that is several model parameters have to be updated when new data arrive online. In this study we propose Distill2Vec, a knowledge distillation strategy to train a compact model with a low number of trainable parameters, so as to reduce the latency of online inference and maintain the model accuracy high. We design a distillation loss function based on Kullback-Leibler divergence to transfer the acquired knowledge from a teacher model trained on offline data, to a small-size student model for online data. Our experiments with publicly available datasets show the superiority of our proposed model over several state-of-the-art approaches with relative gains up to 5% in the link prediction task.

  abstract={With more and more data collected in the offshore platform production, the application of digital twins (DT) in the power grid can realize the data feedback to the digital model concurrently, and realize a high degree of uniformity between the prediction model and the actual physical system based on the exchange of data. On this basis, an accurate digital modeling description of the actual physical process can be accomplished, so that the load can be optimized and scheduled more accurately. In this paper, a micro grid of oilfield platforms is taken as the research object. The load forecasting, fault analysis and power system optimization of offshore oilfield platforms is hard in traditional models. This paper uses the (phasor measurement unit) PMU for situation awareness and update actual time data thus the digital model can receive feedback from actual situation. A DT model based on data collected and uploaded by sensors and the PMU is proposed as a digital model on the cloud. On this basis, this loop forms an adaptive and self-learning system which can minimize the forecast error and obtain better optimization. The DT model can make the design and update of offshore oilfield platforms power system easier, as well as cut down the cost of optimization.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation aims to train a student (model) for accurate inference in a resource-constrained environment. Traditionally, the student is trained by a high-capacity teacher (model) whose training is resource-intensive. The student trained this way is suboptimal because it is difficult to learn the real data distribution from the teacher. To address this issue, we propose to train the student against a discriminator in a minimax game. Such a minimax game has an issue that it can take an excessively long time for the training to converge. To address this issue, we propose adversarial distillation consisting of a student, a teacher, and a discriminator. The discriminator is now a multi-class classifier that distinguishes among the real data, the student, and the teacher. The student and the teacher aim to fool the discriminator via adversarial losses, while they learn from each other via distillation losses. By optimizing the adversarial and the distillation losses simultaneously, the student and the teacher can learn the real data distribution. To accelerate the training, we propose to obtain low-variance gradient updates from the discriminator using a Gumbel-Softmax trick. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed adversarial distillation under both accuracy and training speed.},

  pages={837-852},
  abstract={Large scale 3D maps constructed via LiDAR sensor are widely used on intelligent vehicles for localization in outdoor scenes. However, loading, communication and processing of the original dense maps are time consuming for onboard computing platform, which calls for a more concise representation of maps to reduce the complexity but keep the performance of localization. In this paper, we propose a teacher-student learning paradigm to compress the 3D point cloud map. Specifically, we first find a subset of LiDAR points with high number of observations to preserve the localization performance, which is regarded as the teacher of map compression. An efficient optimization strategy is proposed to deal with the massive data in original map. With the supervision of compressed map, a student model is built by training a random forest model fed with geometric feature descriptors of each point. As a result, the student model is able to compress the map without referring to the expensive numerical optimization. Additionally, by incorporating the features, the innovative student model can be generalized to other new maps while no re-training is required. We conduct thorough experiments on multi-session dataset and KITTI dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed learning paradigm, and the comparison with other map compression methods. The final results show that the learned student model can achieve efficient map compression with comparable LiDAR based localization performance to the original map at the same time.},

  pages={1354-1366},
  abstract={In this work, we develop a joint sample discovery and iterative model evolution method for semi-supervised learning on very small labeled training sets. We propose a master-teacher-student model framework to provide multi-layer guidance during the model evolution process with multiple iterations and generations. The teacher model is constructed by performing an exponential moving average of the student models obtained from past training steps. The master network combines the knowledge of the student and teacher models with additional access to newly discovered samples. The master and teacher models are then used to guide the training of the student network by enforcing the consistency between their predictions of unlabeled samples and evolve all models when more and more samples are discovered. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the process of discovering confident samples from the unlabeled dataset, once coupled with the master-teacher-student network evolution, can significantly improve the overall semi-supervised learning performance. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with a small set of 250 labeled samples, our method achieves an error rate of 11.58%, more than 38% lower than Mean-Teacher (49.91%). When coupled with the MixMatch augmentation and loss function, the improvements are also significant.},

  abstract={Knowledge-transfer (KT) methods allow for transferring the knowledge contained in a large deep learning model into a more lightweight and faster model. However, the vast majority of existing KT approaches are designed to handle mainly classification and detection tasks. This limits their performance on other tasks, such as representation/metric learning. To overcome this limitation, a novel probabilistic KT (PKT) method is proposed in this article. PKT is capable of transferring the knowledge into a smaller student model by keeping as much information as possible, as expressed through the teacher model. The ability of the proposed method to use different kernels for estimating the probability distribution of the teacher and student models, along with the different divergence metrics that can be used for transferring the knowledge, allows for easily adapting the proposed method to different applications. PKT outperforms several existing state-of-the-art KT techniques, while it is capable of providing new insights into KT by enabling several novel applications, as it is demonstrated through extensive experiments on several challenging data sets.},

  pages={523-534},
  abstract={A common shortfall of supervised deep learning for medical imaging is the lack of labeled data, which is often expensive and time consuming to collect. This article presents a new semisupervised method for medical image segmentation, where the network is optimized by a weighted combination of a common supervised loss only for the labeled inputs and a regularization loss for both the labeled and unlabeled data. To utilize the unlabeled data, our method encourages consistent predictions of the network-in-training for the same input under different perturbations. With the semisupervised segmentation tasks, we introduce a transformation-consistent strategy in the self-ensembling model to enhance the regularization effect for pixel-level predictions. To further improve the regularization effects, we extend the transformation in a more generalized form including scaling and optimize the consistency loss with a teacher model, which is an averaging of the student model weights. We extensively validated the proposed semisupervised method on three typical yet challenging medical image segmentation tasks: 1) skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopy images in the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2017 data set; 2) optic disk (OD) segmentation from fundus images in the Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge (REFUGE) data set; and 3) liver segmentation from volumetric CT scans in the Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS) data set. Compared with state-of-the-art, our method shows superior performance on the challenging 2-D/3-D medical images, demonstrating the effectiveness of our semisupervised method for medical image segmentation.},

  abstract={Emerging technologies, such as mobile-edge computing (MEC) and next-generation communications are crucial for enabling rapid development and deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). With the increasing scale of IoT networks, how to optimize the network and allocate the limited resources to provide high-quality services remains a major concern. The existing work in this direction mainly relies on models that are of less practical value for resource-limited IoT networks, and can hardly simulate the dynamic systems in real time. In this article, we integrate digital twins with edge networks and propose the digital twin edge networks (DITENs) to fill the gap between physical edge networks and digital systems. Then, we propose a blockchain-empowered federated learning scheme to strengthen communication security and data privacy protection in DITEN. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of the integrated scheme, we propose an asynchronous aggregation scheme and use digital twin empowered reinforcement learning to schedule relaying users and allocate spectrum resources. Theoretical analysis and numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme can considerably enhance both communication efficiency and data security for IoT applications.},

  abstract={The rapid development of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires industrial production towards digitalization to improve network efficiency. Digital Twin is a promising technology to empower the digital transformation of IIoT by creating virtual models of physical objects. However, the provision of network efficiency in IIoT is very challenging due to resource-constrained devices, stochastic tasks, and resources heterogeneity. Distributed resources in IIoT networks can be efficiently exploited through computation offloading to reduce energy consumption while enhancing data processing efficiency. In this article, we first propose a new paradigm digital twin network to build network topology and the stochastic task arrival model in IIoT systems. Then, we formulate the stochastic computation offloading and resource allocation problem to minimize the long-term energy efficiency. As the formulated problem is a stochastic programming problem, we leverage Lyapunov optimization technique to transform the original problem into a deterministic per-time slot problem. Finally, we present asynchronous actor-critic algorithm to find the optimal stochastic computation offloading policy. Illustrative results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is able to significantly outperforms the benchmarks.},

  abstract={Emerging technologies, such as digital twins and 6th generation (6G) mobile networks, have accelerated the realization of edge intelligence in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The integration of digital twin and 6G bridges the physical system with digital space and enables robust instant wireless connectivity. With increasing concerns on data privacy, federated learning has been regarded as a promising solution for deploying distributed data processing and learning in wireless networks. However, unreliable communication channels, limited resources, and lack of trust among users hinder the effective application of federated learning in IIoT. In this article, we introduce the digital twin wireless networks (DTWN) by incorporating digital twins into wireless networks, to migrate real-time data processing and computation to the edge plane. Then, we propose a blockchain empowered federated learning framework running in the DTWN for collaborative computing, which improves the reliability and security of the system and enhances data privacy. Moreover, to balance the learning accuracy and time cost of the proposed scheme, we formulate an optimization problem for edge association by jointly considering digital twin association, training data batch size, and bandwidth allocation. We exploit multiagent reinforcement learning to find an optimal solution to the problem. Numerical results on real-world dataset show that the proposed scheme yields improved efficiency and reduced cost compared to benchmark learning methods.},

  abstract={The continuously growing amount of monitored data in the Industry 4.0 context requires strong and reliable anomaly detection techniques. The advancement of Digital Twin technologies allows for realistic simulations of complex machinery; therefore, it is ideally suited to generate synthetic datasets for the use in anomaly detection approaches when compared to actual measurement data. In this article, we present novel weakly supervised approaches to anomaly detection for industrial settings. The approaches make use of a Digital Twin to generate a training dataset, which simulates the normal operation of the machinery, along with a small set of labeled anomalous measurement from the real machinery. In particular, we introduce a clustering-based approach, called cluster centers (CC), and a neural architecture based on the Siamese Autoencoders (SAE), which are tailored for weakly supervised settings with very few labeled data samples. The performance of the proposed methods is compared against various state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms on an application to a real-world dataset from a facility monitoring system, by using a multitude of performance measures. Also, the influence of hyperparameters related to feature extraction and network architecture is investigated. We find that the proposed SAE-based solutions outperform state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches very robustly for many different hyperparameter settings on all performance measures.},

  abstract={As an emerging information technique, digital twin has made great breakthroughs in low-cost and high-efficiency physical equipment dynamic modelling and controlling. To comply with time-varying optical path states and service requirements in dynamic networks, a digital twin architecture is proposed to enable the dynamic programmable optical transceiver (POT) configuration through deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed POT configuration approach is capable of establishing dynamic POT controlling model and configuring multiple optical transceivers intelligently according to the real-time network performance feedback. Different from typical POTs, digital twin has special advantages in continuously updating configuration model by learning from the real-time monitored data. Simulation results show that the proposed POT can reduce 7.0% blocking probability and improve 15.5% throughput compared with classic POTs based on static controlling criteria and neural networks.},

This article aims at detecting anomalies in measurements from sensors, identifying the faulty ones and accommodating them with appropriate estimated data, thus paving the way to reliable digital twins. More specifically, we propose a general machine-learning-based architecture for sensor validation built upon a series of neural-network estimators and a classifier. Estimators correspond to virtual sensors of all unreliable sensors (to reconstruct normal behaviour and replace the isolated faulty sensor within the system), whereas the classifier is used for detection and isolation tasks. A comprehensive statistical analysis on three different real-world data-sets is conducted and the performance of the proposed architecture validated under hard and soft synthetically-generated faults.},

  abstract={Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) enables distributed intelligent services varying with the dynamic and realtime industrial environment to achieve Industry 4.0 benefits. In this article, we consider a new architecture of digital twin (DT) empowered Industrial IoT, where DTs capture the characteristics of industrial devices to assist federated learning. Noticing that DTs may bring estimation deviations from the actual value of device state, a trusted-based aggregation is proposed in federated learning to alleviate the effects of such deviation. We adaptively adjust the aggregation frequency of federated learning based on Lyapunov dynamic deficit queue and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), to improve the learning performance under the resource constraints. To further adapt to the heterogeneity of industrial IoT, a clustering-based asynchronous federated learning framework is proposed.

  pages={2771-2782},
  abstract={Annotation scarcity is a long-standing problem in medical image analysis area. To efficiently leverage limited annotations, abundant unlabeled data are additionally exploited in semi-supervised learning, while well-established cross-modality data are investigated in domain adaptation. In this paper, we aim to explore the feasibility of concurrently leveraging both unlabeled data and cross-modality data for annotation-efficient cardiac segmentation. To this end, we propose a cutting-edge semi-supervised domain adaptation framework, namely Dual-Teacher++. Besides directly learning from limited labeled target domain data (e.g., CT) via a student model adopted by previous literature, we design novel dual teacher models, including an inter-domain teacher model to explore cross-modality priors from source domain (e.g., MR) and an intra-domain teacher model to investigate the knowledge beneath unlabeled target domain. In this way, the dual teacher models would transfer acquired inter- and intra-domain knowledge to the student model for further integration and exploitation. Moreover, to encourag reliable dual-domain knowledge transfer, we enhance the inter-domain knowledge transfer on the samples with higher similarity to target domain after appearance alignment, and also strengthen intra-domain knowledge transfer of unlabeled target data with higher prediction confidence. In this way, the student model can obtain reliable dual-domain knowledge and yield improved performance on target domain data. We extensively evaluated the feasibility of our method on the MM-WHS 2017 challenge dataset. The experiments have demonstrated the superiority of our framework over other semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation methods. Moreover, our performance gains could be yielded in bidirections, i.e., adapting from MR to CT, and from CT to MR. Our code will be available at https://github.com/kli-lalala/Dual-Teacher-.},

  year={2021},
  volume={31},
  number={9},
  pages={3444-3455},
  abstract={In this work, we propose to push the performance limit of semi-supervised learning on very small sets of labeled samples by developing a new method called learned model composition with critical sample look-ahead (LMCS). Training efficient deep neural networks on much smaller sets of labeled samples is a challenging problem. With a small labeled set, the initial network suffers from low accuracy. Based on this error-prone network, the subsequent semi-supervised learning process will be fragile and unstable. To address this issue, we propose to introduce a look-ahead master model to identify the correct direction of model evolution to effectively guide the semi-supervised learning process of the student model. Specifically, our proposed LMCS method explores two major ideas. First, it introduces a new learned model composition structure so that we can compose a more efficient master network from student models of past iterations through a network learning process. Second, we develop a new method, called confined maximum entropy search, to discover new critical samples near the model decision boundary and provide the master model with look-ahead access to these samples to enhance its guidance capability. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LMCS method outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods, especially on small sets of labeled samples. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with a very small set of 80 labeled samples, our method outperforms Google’s MixMatch method, reducing the error rate by more than 10%.},

  abstract={With high mobility, low cost and outstanding maneuverability properties, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm has attracted worldwide attentions in both academia and industry. Nevertheless, the complex and coherent characteristics of the intelligent cooperation of UAV swarm greatly restrict its wide application. The recent development of artificial intelligence provides new methodologies for intelligent cooperation of UAV swarm. However, these methods are resource-in-tensive that cannot be directly applied in the computation and storage constrained UAVs. In this article, we propose a novel digital twin (DT)-based intelligent cooperation framework of UAV swarm. In the framework, a digital twin model is established to reflect the physical entity (i.e., UAV swarm) with high-fidelity and monitors its whole life cycle. Next, the decision model that integrates a machine learning algorithm is built to explore the global optimal solution and controls the behaviors of UAV swarm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, a case study on intelligent network reconstruction is introduced, and simulation results are presented. Finally, a representative application provided by the framework is discussed.},

  pages={334-343},
  abstract={This paper presents an innovative investigation on prototyping a digital twin (DT) as the platform for human-robot interactive welding and welder behavior analysis. This human-robot interaction (HRI) working style helps to enhance human users' operational productivity and comfort; while data-driven welder behavior analysis benefits to further novice welder training. This HRI system includes three modules: 1) a human user who demonstrates the welding operations offsite with her/his operations recorded by the motion-tracked handles; 2) a robot that executes the demonstrated welding operations to complete the physical welding tasks onsite; 3) a DT system that is developed based on virtual reality (VR) as a digital replica of the physical human-robot interactive welding environment. The DT system bridges a human user and robot through a bi-directional information flow: a) transmitting demonstrated welding operations in VR to the robot in the physical environment; b) displaying the physical welding scenes to human users in VR. Compared to existing DT systems reported in the literatures, the developed one provides better capability in engaging human users in interacting with welding scenes, through an augmented VR. To verify the effectiveness, six welders, skilled with certain manual welding training and unskilled without any training, tested the system by completing the same welding job; three skilled welders produce satisfied welded workpieces, while the other three unskilled do not. A data-driven approach as a combination of fast Fourier transform (FFT), principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector machine (SVM) is developed to analyze their behaviors. Given an operation sequence, i.e., motion speed sequence of the welding torch, frequency features are firstly extracted by FFT and then reduced in dimension through PCA, which are finally routed into SVM for classification. The trained model demonstrates a 94.44% classification accuracy in the testing dataset. The successful pattern recognition in skilled welder operations should benefit to accelerate novice welder training.},

  pages={1267-1282},
  abstract={The deployment of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship real-time detection is largely hindered by huge computational cost. In this article, we propose a novel learning scheme for training a lightweight ship detector called Tiny YOLO-Lite, which simultaneously 1) reduces the model storage size; 2) decreases the floating point operations (FLOPs) calculation; and 3) guarantees the high accuracy with faster speed. This is achieved by self-designed backbone structure and network pruning, which enforces channel-level sparsity in the backbone network and yields a compact model. In addition, knowledge distillation is also applied to make up for the performance decline caused by network pruning. Hereinto, we propose to let small student model mimic cumbersome teacher's output to achieve improved generalization. Rather than applying vanilla full feature imitation, we redefine the distilled knowledge as the inter-relationship between different levels of feature maps and then transfer it from the large network to a smaller one. On account that the detectors should focus more on the salient regions containing ships while background interference is overwhelming, a novel attention mechanism is designed and then attached to the distilled feature for enhanced representation. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on SSDD, HRSID, and two large-scene SAR images to verify the effectiveness of the thinner SAR ship object detector in comparison of with other CNN-based algorithms. The detection results demonstrate that the proposed detector can achieve lighter architecture with 2.8-M model size, more efficient inference (>200 fps) with low computation cost, and more accurate prediction with knowledge transfer strategy.},

  abstract={An aircraft is made up of a number of complicated systems which work in harmony to ensure safe and trouble-free flight. In order to maintain such a platform, many diagnostic and prognostic techniques have been suggested, mostly aimed at components but some at the system level. Together these form a patchwork approach to the overall problem of efficiently informing aircraft maintenance to the Original Equipment Manufacturers, the operators /airlines, and the Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul organisations. It involves these organisations having to support several different approaches to aircraft health management, and is therefore inefficient and costly. In the current work, a streamlined methodology is put forward. This is based on OSA-CBM (Open System Architecture for Condition Based Maintenance) and can be applied to any aircraft system. Integral with this is the use of mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) for feature selection, the resulting symptom vector being used for fault diagnosis. This approach is demonstrated on three test cases: the engine, the environmental control system, and the fuel system. In each case, the digital twin setup, simulation conditions for healthy and faulty scenarios, a methodology based on OSA-CBM up to diagnostics are detailed. Diagnostics is carried out for each system in turn, using four machine learning supervised algorithms. The best performing algorithm for each system will then subsequently be used in a vehicle level reasoner called FAVER (A Framework for Aerospace Vehicle Reasoning), which requires these system diagnoses as a starting point for vehicle reasoning and fault ambiguity resolution.},

  abstract={Since the emergence of digital and smart healthcare, the world has hastened to apply various technologies in this field to promote better health operation and patients’ well being, increase life expectancy, and reduce healthcare costs. One promising technology and game changer in this domain is digital twin (DT). DT is expected to change the concept of digital healthcare and take this field to another level that has never been seen before. DT is a virtual replica of a physical asset that reflects the current status through real-time transformed data. This article proposes and implements an intelligent context-aware healthcare system using the DT framework. This framework is a beneficial contribution to digital healthcare and to improve healthcare operations. Accordingly, an electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rhythms classifier model was built using machine learning to diagnose heart disease and detect heart problems. The implemented models successfully predicted a particular heart condition with high accuracy in different algorithms. The collected results have shown that integrating DT with the healthcare field would improve healthcare processes by bringing patients and healthcare professionals together in an intelligent, comprehensive, and scalable health ecosystem. Also, implementing an ECG classifier that detects heart conditions gives the inspiration for applying ML and artificial intelligence with different human body metrics for continuous monitoring and abnormalities detection. Finally, neural-network-based algorithms deal better with ECG data than traditional ML algorithms.},

  abstract={This article proposes a human-knowledge-integrated particle swarm optimization (Hi-PSO) scheme to globally optimize the design of the hydraulic-electromagnetic energy-harvesting shock absorber (HESA) for road vehicles. A newly developed k-fold swarm learning framework is the key to the Hi-PSO scheme, which runs k groups (folds) of individual local optimization (using a selected learning cycle), and validation (using the other k-1 testing cycles) with the concept of digital twin introduced into the design of the HESA. It aims to achieve the optimum energy recovery efficiency globally in both learning cycles and testing cycles. Within the learning framework, a nearest-neighborhood particle swarm learning algorithm is developed to incorporate human knowledge (e.g., ISO standards) for local optimization so that the computational load can be reduced through downsizing of the learning spaces. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the energy recovery and damping performance under both local conditions (duty cycles used for learning) and global conditions (six duty cycles covering the main equivalent amplitudes and frequencies of the suspension's operation). Compared with the conventional PSO algorithm, Hi-PSO is shown to be more robust by achieving a 5.17% higher mean value in 10 trials while achieving the same maximum energy efficiency. The global optimum result is obtained under 20 mm/1.5 Hz condition and achieves an average energy efficiency of 59.07%.},

  abstract={As of today, the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication system has been rolled out in many countries and the number of 5G subscribers already reaches a very large scale. It is time for academia and industry to shift their attention towards the next generation. At this crossroad, an overview of the current state of the art and a vision of future communications are definitely of interest. This article thus aims to provide a comprehensive survey to draw a picture of the sixth generation (6G) system in terms of drivers, use cases, usage scenarios, requirements, key performance indicators (KPIs), architecture, and enabling technologies. First, we attempt to answer the question of “Is there any need for 6G?” by shedding light on its key driving factors, in which we predict the explosive growth of mobile traffic until 2030, and envision potential use cases and usage scenarios. Second, the technical requirements of 6G are discussed and compared with those of 5G with respect to a set of KPIs in a quantitative manner. Third, the state-of-the-art 6G research efforts and activities from representative institutions and countries are summarized, and a tentative roadmap of definition, specification, standardization, and regulation is projected. Then, we identify a dozen of potential technologies and introduce their principles, advantages, challenges, and open research issues. Finally, the conclusions are drawn to paint a picture of “What 6G may look like?.” This survey is intended to serve as an enlightening guideline to spur interests and further investigations for subsequent research and development of 6G communications systems.},

  abstract={The 6G vision of creating authentic digital twin representations of the physical world calls for new sensing solutions to compose multi-layered maps of our environments. Radio sensing using the mobile communication network as a sensor has the potential to become an essential component of the solution. With the evolution of cellular systems to mmWave bands in 5G and potentially sub-THz bands in 6G, small cell deployments will begin to dominate. Large bandwidth systems deployed in small cell configurations provide an unprecedented opportunity to employ the mobile network for sensing. In this paper, we focus on the major design aspects of such a cellular joint communication and sensing (JCAS) system. We present an analysis of the choice of the waveform that points towards choosing the one that is best suited for communication also for radar sensing. We discuss several techniques for efficiently integrating the sensing capability into the JCAS system, some of which are applicable with NR air-interface for evolved 5G systems. Specifically, methods for reducing sensing overhead by appropriate sensing signal design or by configuring separate numerologies for communications and sensing are presented. Sophisticated use of the sensing signals is shown to reduce the signaling overhead by a factor of 2.67 for an exemplary road traffic monitoring use case. We then present a vision for future advanced JCAS systems building upon distributed massive MIMO and discuss various other research challenges for JCAS that need to be addressed in order to pave the way towards natively integrated JCAS in 6G.},

  abstract={Digital twinning is one of the top ten technology trends in the last couple of years, due to its high applicability in the industrial sector. The integration of big data analytics and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI-ML) techniques with digital twinning, further enriches its significance and research potential with new opportunities and unique challenges. To date, a number of scientific models have been designed and implemented related to this evolving topic. However, there is no systematic review of digital twinning, particularly focusing on the role of AI-ML and big data, to guide the academia and industry towards future developments. Therefore, this article emphasizes the role of big data and AI-ML in the creation of digital twins (DTs) or DT-based systems for various industrial applications, by highlighting the current state-of-the-art deployments. We performed a systematic review on top of multidisciplinary electronic bibliographic databases, in addition to existing patents in the field. Also, we identified development-tools that can facilitate various levels of the digital twinning. Further, we designed a big data driven and AI-enriched reference architecture that leads developers to a complete DT-enabled system. Finally, we highlighted the research potential of AI-ML for digital twinning by unveiling challenges and current opportunities.},

  title={A Decision Support System for Urban Agriculture Using Digital Twin: A Case Study With Aquaponics}, 
  year={2021},

  pages={35691-35708},
  abstract={There are many pressures on the global food system such as urbanization, climate change, and environmental degradation. Urban agriculture is an approach to producing food inside cities where, globally, more than half the worlds population live. It has been shown to have a range of potential benefits, for instance in reducing waste and logistics costs. Increased uptake of urban farming can even relieve pressure on the natural environment by reducing the burden of production required from farmland by creating space for it to recover from accumulated damage as a result of the use of unsustainable farming practices historically. This article describes an approach for a new type of decision support system suitable for urban farming production. We discuss differences between the requirements and the users of decision support in urban agriculture, and those of ordinary agribusiness enterprises. A case study is performed using a novel technology for urban farming: a cyber-physical implementation of aquaponics is enhanced with adaptive capabilities using a digital twin system and machine learning. Aquaponics is a farming technique that utilizes a harmonious nutrient exchange cycle for growing plants and fish together, while conserving water, and possibly without the need for soil or even sunlight. Empirical results are provided that evaluate the use of data driven decision analytics and a digital twin model to plan production from the aquaponic system during a three month trial. Another set of results evaluate a proposed modelling framework for large scale urban agriculture ecosystems. This concept forms the basis of the suggested approach for an urban farming decision support system that coordinates the activities of many independent producers to target collective goals.},

  year={2021},
  volume={25},
  number={8},
  pages={3061-3072},
  abstract={Objective: This study aims to develop and validate a novel framework, iPhantom, for automated creation of patient-specific phantoms or “digital-twins (DT)” using patient medical images. The framework is applied to assess radiation dose to radiosensitive organs in CT imaging of individual patients. Method: Given a volume of patient CT images, iPhantom segments selected anchor organs and structures (e.g., liver, bones, pancreas) using a learning-based model developed for multi-organ CT segmentation. Organs which are challenging to segment (e.g., intestines) are incorporated from a matched phantom template, using a diffeomorphic registration model developed for multi-organ phantom-voxels. The resulting digital-twin phantoms are used to assess organ doses during routine CT exams. Result: iPhantom was validated on both with a set of XCAT digital phantoms (n = 50) and an independent clinical dataset (n = 10) with similar accuracy. iPhantom precisely predicted all organ locations yielding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) 0.6 - 1 for anchor organs and DSC of 0.3-0.9 for all other organs. iPhantom showed <; 10% errors in estimated radiation dose for the majority of organs, which was notably superior to the state-of-the-art baseline method (20-35% dose errors). Conclusion: iPhantom enables automated and accurate creation of patient-specific phantoms and, for the first time, provides sufficient and automated patient-specific dose estimates for CT dosimetry. Significance: The new framework brings the creation and application of CHPs (computational human phantoms) to the level of individual CHPs through automation, achieving wide and precise organ localization, paving the way for clinical monitoring, personalized optimization, and large-scale research.},

  pages={45454-45461},
  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD) is one of the most effective neural network light-weighting techniques when training data is available. However, KD is seldom applicable to an environment where it is difficult or impossible to access training data. To solve this problem, a complete zero-shot KD (C-ZSKD) based on adversarial learning has been recently proposed, but the so-called biased sample generation problem limits the performance of C-ZSKD. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel C-ZSKD algorithm that utilizes a label-free adversarial perturbation. The proposed adversarial perturbation derives a constraint of the squared norm of gradient style by using the convolution of probability distributions and the 2nd order Taylor series approximation. The constraint serves to increase the variance of the adversarial sample distribution, which makes the student model learn the decision boundary of the teacher model more accurately without labeled data. Through analysis of the distribution of adversarial samples on the embedded space, this paper also provides an insight into the characteristics of adversarial samples that are effective for adversarial learning-based C-ZSKD.},

  volume={30},
  number={},
  pages={3734-3747},
  abstract={Despite the fact that great progress has been made on single image deraining tasks, it is still challenging for existing models to produce satisfactory results directly, and it often requires a single or multiple refinement stages to gradually improve the quality. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that existing image-level refinement with a stage-independent learning design is problematic with the side effect of over/under-deraining. To resolve this issue, we for the first time propose the mechanism of learning to carry out refinement on the unsatisfactory features, and propose a novel attentive feature refinement (AFR) module. Specifically, AFR is designed as a two-branched network for simultaneous rain-distribution-aware attention map learning and attention guided hierarchy-preserving feature refinement. Guided by task-specific attention, coarse features are progressively refined to better model the diversified rainy effects. By using a separable convolution as the basic component, our AFR module introduces little computation overhead and can be readily integrated into most rainy-to-clean image translation networks for achieving better deraining results. By incorporating a series of AFR modules into a general encoder-decoder network, AFR-Net is constructed for deraining and it achieves new state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real images. Furthermore, by using AFR-Net as a teacher model, we explore the use of knowledge distillation to successfully learn a student model that is also able to achieve state-of-the-art results but with a much faster inference speed (i.e., it only takes 0.08 second to process a 512×512 rainy image). Code and pre-trained models are available at (https://github.com/RobinCSIRO/AFR-Net).},

For this purposes the advanced simulation techniques - Digital twin technologies along with Cloud services and Big data processing are increasingly implemented. The paper focuses on introducing these technologies into the educational process of the electrical engineers. The demand on industry digitalization and the rapid developments of digital technologies require the academia to keep up and introduce the basics of the technologies into the training process of the future electrical engineers.

  pages={14039-14050},
  abstract={Digital twin (DT) systems that replicate the physical world digitally are powerful tools for monitoring physical systems and evaluating algorithms, but current DT systems are commonly not applicable for robotic deployment and investigation. Meanwhile, current 3-D simulation-based robotic platforms do not model the dynamics of the physical world on-the-fly as done in DT systems, limiting their potential for the development of robotics in challenging environments. To tackle this issue, we propose the first robot-centered smart DT framework, namely, Terra, to facilitate the deployment of robots in challenging environments. The proposed Terra framework introduces a comprehensive DT representation to encode the useful real-time dynamics of both the physical world and the robot agent deployed therein. A multiview multimodality perception module is further devised for Terra to obtain high-level semantics and deliver a precise description of the current status of the environment and the robot agent. By mapping the perceived results to the virtual replica of the physical environment, Terra actively updates the action policy and sends it back to the agent, forming an integral and real-time information feedback loop. In practice, to help demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework, we deliberately set up a challenging unordered physical environment with many obstacles and a very simple robot aiming to fulfill a navigation task. Empirical results show that the proposed Terra framework successfully facilitates the robot to accomplish the task without causing hazards.},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={55448-55464},
  abstract={This study proposes a novel hands-free interaction method using multimodal gestures such as eye gazing and head gestures and deep learning for human-robot interaction (HRI) in mixed reality (MR) environments. Since human operators hold some objects for conducting tasks, there are many constrained situations where they cannot use their hands for HRI interactions. To provide more effective and intuitive task assistance, the proposed hands-free method supports coarse-to-fine interactions. Eye gazing-based interaction is used for coarse interactions such as searching and previewing of target objects, and head gesture interactions are used for fine interactions such as selection and 3D manipulation. In addition, deep learning-based object detection is applied to estimate the initial positioning of physical objects to be manipulated by the robot. The result of object detection is then combined with 3D spatial mapping in the MR environment for supporting accurate initial object positioning. Furthermore, virtual object-based indirect manipulation is proposed to support more intuitive and efficient control of the robot, compared with traditional direct manipulation (e.g., joint-based and end effector-based manipulations). In particular, a digital twin, the synchronized virtual robot of the real robot, is used to provide a preview and simulation of the real robot to manipulate it more effectively and accurately. Two case studies were conducted to confirm the originality and advantages of the proposed hands-free HRI: (1) performance evaluation of initial object positioning and (2) comparative analysis with traditional direct robot manipulations. The deep learning-based initial positioning reduces much effort for robot manipulation using eye gazing and head gestures. The object-based indirect manipulation also supports more effective HRI than previous direct interaction methods.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been a great deal of research in developing end-to-end speech recognition models, which enable simplifying the traditional pipeline and achieving promising results. Despite their remarkable performance improvements, end-to-end models typically require expensive computational cost to show successful performance. To reduce this computational burden, knowledge distillation (KD), which is a popular model compression method, has been used to transfer knowledge from a deep and complex model (teacher) to a shallower and simpler model (student). Previous KD approaches have commonly designed the architecture of the student by reducing the width per layer or the number of layers of the teacher. This structural reduction scheme might limit the flexibility of model selection since the student model structure should be similar to that of the given teacher. To cope with this limitation, we propose a KD method for end-to-end speech recognition, namely TutorNet, that applies KD techniques across different types of neural networks at the hidden representation-level as well as the output-level. For concrete realizations, we firstly apply representation-level knowledge distillation (RKD) during the initialization step, and then apply the softmax-level knowledge distillation (SKD) combined with the original task learning. When the student is trained with RKD, we make use of frame weighting that points out the frames to which the teacher pays more attention. Through a number of experiments, it is verified that TutorNet not only distills the knowledge between networks with different topologies but also significantly contributes to improving the performance of the distilled student.},

  pages={1542-1555},
  abstract={Voice activity detection is an essential pre-processing component for speech-related tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional supervised VAD systems obtain frame-level labels from an ASR pipeline by using, e.g., a Hidden Markov model. These ASR models are commonly trained on clean and fully transcribed data, limiting VAD systems to be trained on clean or synthetically noised datasets. Therefore, a major challenge for supervised VAD systems is their generalization towards noisy, real-world data. This work proposes a data-driven teacher-student approach for VAD, which utilizes vast and unconstrained audio data for training. Unlike previous approaches, only weak labels during teacher training are required, enabling the utilization of any real-world, potentially noisy dataset. Our approach firstly trains a teacher model on a source dataset (Audioset) using clip-level supervision. After training, the teacher provides frame-level guidance to a student model on an unlabeled, target dataset. A multitude of student models trained on mid- to large-sized datasets are investigated (Audioset, Voxceleb, NIST SRE). Our approach is then respectively evaluated on clean, artificially noised, and real-world data. We observe significant performance gains in artificially noised and real-world scenarios. Lastly, we compare our approach against other unsupervised and supervised VAD methods, demonstrating our method's superiority.},

  abstract={As COVID-19 hounds the world, the common cause of finding a swift solution to manage the pandemic has brought together researchers, institutions, governments, and society at large. The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI)—including machine learning (ML) and Big Data analytics—as well as Robotics and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First, four areas, where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely: 1) tracking and tracing; 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable IoT (WIoT); 3) personal digital twins (PDTs); and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in South Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis; 2) risk prediction; 3) vaccine and drug development; 4) research data set; 5) early warnings and alerts; 6) social control and fake news detection; and 7) communication and chatbot. Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including: 1) crowd surveillance; 2) public announcements; 3) screening and diagnosis; and 4) essential supply delivery. Finally, we discuss how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19.},

  abstract={The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has caused a crisis that affects all segments of the population. As the knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 evolve, an appropriate response plan for this pandemic is considered one of the most effective methods for controlling the spread of the virus. Recent studies indicate that a city Digital Twin (DT) is beneficial for tackling this health crisis, because it can construct a virtual replica to simulate factors, such as climate conditions, response policies, and people's trajectories, to help plan efficient and inclusive decisions. However, a city DTsystem relies on long-term and high-quality data collection to make appropriate decisions, limiting its advantages when facing urgent crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Federated Learning (FL), in which all clients can learn a shared model while retaining all training data locally, emerges as a promising solution for accumulating the insights from multiple data sources efficiently Furthermore, the enhanced privacy protection settings removing the privacy barriers lie in this collaboration. In this work, we propose a framework that fused city DT with FL to achieve a novel collaborative paradigm that allows multiple city DTs to share the local strategy and status quickly. In particular, an FL central server manages the local updates of multiple collaborators (city DTs), providing a global model that is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems until the model gains the correlations between various response plans and infection trends. This approach means a collaborative city DT paradigm fused with FL techniques can obtain knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs and eventually establish a "global view" of city crisis management. Meanwhile, it also helps improve each city's DT by consolidating other DT's data without violating privacy rules. In this paper, we use the COVID-19 pandemic as the use case of the proposed framework. The experimental results on a real dataset with various response plans validate our proposed solution and demonstrate its superior performance.},

  abstract={This article presents an approach based on numerical reduced-order modeling to analyze the thermal behavior of electric traction motors. In this article, a single conjugate heat transfer analysis provides the possibility to accurately predict thermal performances by incorporating both computational fluid dynamic and heat transfer modules. Then, the developed model is used as the basis for deriving a fast reduced-order model of the traction motor enabling prediction of motor thermal behavior in duty cycles with a high number of operating points. All the results achieved are verified using flow and temperature measurements carried out on a traction motor designed and built for a traction application. A good agreement between the measured and estimated values of flows and temperatures is achieved while keeping the computation time within a reasonable range for both the full-order and reduced-order conjugate heat transfer models. The optimized full-order model can be run in minutes and the reduced-order model computation time is less than one second per operating point. The transient simulation based on the reduced-order model is conducted and both the learning phase and validation results are well illustrated. It is shown than the deviation of the reduced-order model in estimating the motor thermal performance is less than one celsius degree from the full-order model.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation, which aims to train model under the supervision from another large model (teacher model) to the original model (student model), has achieved remarkable results in supervised learning. However, there are two major problems with existing knowledge distillation methods. One is the teacher's supervision is sometimes misleading, and the other is the student's prediction is not accurate enough. To address the first issue, instead of learning a combination of both teachers and ground truth, we apply knowledge adjustment to correct teachers' supervision using ground truth. For the second problem, we use the selective classification framework to train the student model. In particular, the deep gambler loss is adopted to predict with reservation by explicitly introducing the ($m+1$)-th class. We consider two settings of knowledge distillation: (1) distillation across different network structures (AlexNet, ResNet), and (2) distillation across networks with different depths (ResNet18, ResNet5 0) to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results on benchmark datasets (i.e., Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100) are reported with higher prediction accuracies and lower coverage errors.},

  abstract={The importance of developing an application based on intervention technology that leads to a healthier life is widely recognized. A challenging part of realizing the application is the need for planning, i.e., considering a user's health goal (e.g., sleep at 10:00 p.m. to get enough sleep), providing intervention at the appropriate timing to help the user achieve the goal. The reinforcement learning (RL) approach is well suited to this type of problem since it is a methodology for planning; RL finds the optimal strategy as that which maximizes future expected profit. The purpose of this study is to clarify the effects of intervention based on RL to support healthy daily life. Therefore, we (i) collect real daily activity data from participants, (ii) generate a user model that imitates the user's response to system interventions, (iii) examine valuable goals and design them as rewards in RL and (iv) obtain optimal intervention strategies by RL via simulations given a user model and goals. We evaluate a generated user model and verify by simulations whether our method could successfully achieve the goal. In addition, we analyze the cases that demonstrated higher probability of achieving the goal and report the features.},

  abstract={The Mean Teacher (MT) model of Tarvainen and Valpola has shown good performance on several semi-supervised benchmark datasets. MT maintains a teacher model's weights as the exponential moving average of a student model's weights and minimizes the divergence between their probability predictions under diverse perturbations of the inputs. However, MT is known to suffer from confirmation bias, that is, reinforcing incorrect teacher model predictions. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method called Local Clustering (LC) to mitigate the effect of confirmation bias. In MT, each data point is considered independent of other points during training; however, data points are likely to be close to each other in feature space if they share similar features. Motivated by this, we cluster data points locally by minimizing the pairwise distance between neighboring data points in feature space. Combined with a standard classification cross-entropy objective on labeled data points, the misclassified unlabeled data points are pulled towards high-density regions of their correct class with the help of their neighbors, thus improving model performance. We demonstrate on semi-supervised benchmark datasets SVHN and CIFAR-10 that adding our LC loss to MT yields significant improvements compared to MT and performance comparable to the state of the art in semi-supervised learning11The code is available at: https://github.com/jay1204/local_clustering_with_mt_for_ssl.},

  abstract={Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) enables distributed intelligent services varying with the complex industrial environment to achieve the benefits of Industry 4.0. In this paper, we consider a new architecture of digital twin empowered Industrial IoT, in which digital twins capture characteristics of industrial devices to assist federated learning tasks of industrial scenarios. A trust-based aggregation is proposed in federated learning to alleviate the effects of digital twins deviation and emphasize the contribution of high-performance clients. Based on Lyapunov dynamic deficit queue and deep reinforcement learning, we propose a federated learning framework that adaptively adjusts the aggregation frequency to improve the learning performance under resource constraints. Numerical results show that the proposed framework outperforms the benchmark in terms of learning accuracy, convergence, and energy saving.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation has proven to be an effective model compression method that exploits the knowledge from a teacher model for supervising a student model by minimizing the distribution difference between the knowledge and the prediction produced by the student model. In this work, we focus on improving its performance from the perspective of divergence measures. A general form representing a family of divergence measures is introduced and a novel learning paradigm that jointly optimizes multiple measures is proposed by formalizing it as a multi-objective learning problem. Conditioned on Pareto optimality, the weights of different divergences are tuned in an automated way during training. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of student networks compared to the state-of-the-art methods for knowledge distillation.

  abstract={There is a high demand for high-end lab equipment in engineering education, especially for courses that require practical hands-on lab exercises. However, this equipment is quite expensive which forces some institutions to seek other alternatives or forego them altogether. In addition, online courses tend to be light on hardware because of the practical and technical challenges associated with running remote hardware-based laboratories. Therefore, a system is needed that allows students who are enrolled in remote courses to experience hardware-intensive classes just as they would an in-person course (especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic). In this work, use virtual and augmented reality to build and test a remote UR-10 robotics lab that allows students to work together on a hands-on robotics-based lab. In the future, we plan to demonstrate its technical and pedagogical suitability by running a user study in a real-world class whereby remote students enrolled in a course will participate in a series of experiments to control a UR-10 robot arm. It opens up avenues to explore the advantages and shortcomings of running coordinated group lab exercises between students from different institutions, time-zones, and continents by time-decoupling the schedules. The use of a Virtual Reality interface coupled with a digital twin of the UR10 robot will allow us to investigate the suitability of different user interfaces, and what VR tools would best facilitate remote group work and faculty instruction.},

  abstract={Most of the methods in operators' current 5G networks use expert knowledge assisted by machine learning algorithms to generate optimization decisions. However, these methods are inadaptive to the dynamic changes of high-dimensional network states, thus the result is often suboptimal. Reinforcement learning can better cope with high-dimensional network state space and parameter space. However, when applied to real network, challenges arise such as difficult to obtain data samples, time-consuming and risky to explore real networks during model training. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a combined approach of expert knowledge, reinforcement learning and digital twin for the self-optimization of mobile networks. By constructing a digital twin of the current network, the future network state is predicted based on which optimization decisions are generated by expert knowledge and reinforcement learning respectively, and then input into the digital twin. Digital twin simulates their rewards and decides a final action for execution. Simulation results have confirmed that the proposed scheme can achieve higher rewards than either expert knowledge or reinforcement learning, and can avoid negative impact on real network performance. This paper also describes several potential application scenarios for the proposed approach in 6G networks and discusses key issues for future research.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the problem of blind distillation, which aims to train a student model with unlabeled data under the supervision of a pre-trained teacher model. The proposed framework introduces metric learning to blind distillation. Specifically, teacher-assisted mini-batch (TAM) sampling is proposed, which makes triplets of anchor, positive and negative samples on unlabeled data by using the teacher's knowledge. In addition, we propose a metric-based loss, namely Contrastive Additive Margin (CAM) Softmax loss, which efficiently uses all combinations of triplets on each mini-batch obtained by TAM sampling. In experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed framework on face and speaker verification tasks, where student models are trained on unlabeled VoxCeleb videos with a teacher model pre-trained on VGGFace2 images.},

  abstract={Segmentation of skin lesions is important for disease diagnoses and treatment planning. Over the years, semi-supervised methods using pseudo labels have boosted the segmentation performance with limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However, the unreliable targets in pseudo labels might lead to meaningless guidance for unlabeled data. In this paper, to solve this issue, we propose a novel confidence aware semi-supervised learning method based on a mean teacher scheme. Concretely, we design a confidence module to predict the model confidence guided by the True Class Probability. Then in the mean teacher framework, the student model gradually learns trustworthy targets from teacher model. To further improve the segmentation quality, we fine-tune the student model with reliable content in pseudo labels. We conduct extensive experiments on 2018 ISIC skin lesion segmentation dataset and our method outperforms other state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel method on image sentiment analysis called cross-domain semi-supervised deep metric learning (CDSS-DML). The proposed method has two contributions. Firstly, since previous researches on image sentiment analysis suffer from the limit of a small amount of well-labeled data, which occurs a decrease in accuracy of classification, CDSS-DML breaks through the limit by training with unlabeled data based on a teacher-student model. Secondly, the proposed method overcomes the difficulty of distribution shift between well-labeled and unlabeled data by jointing three losses. Especially, the proposed method constructs an effective latent space with the joint loss considering the inter-class and the intra-class correlations for image sentiments. From experimental results, the performance improvement with CDSS-DML is confirmed.},

  number={},
  pages={356-360},
  abstract={This paper presents an improved mean teacher (MT) based method for large-scale weakly labeled semi-supervised sound event detection (SED), by focusing on learning a better student model. Two main improvements are proposed based on the authors’ previous perturbation based MT method. Firstly, an event-aware module is de-signed to allow multiple branches with different kernel sizes to be fused via an attention mechanism. By inserting this module after the convolutional layer, each neuron can adaptively adjust its receptive field to suit different sound events. Secondly, instead of using the teacher model to provide a consistency cost term, we propose using a stochastic inference of unlabeled examples to generate high quality pseudo-targets by averaging multiple predictions from the perturbed student model. MixUp of both labeled and unlabeled data is further exploited to improve the effectiveness of student model. Finally, the teacher model can be obtained via exponential moving average (EMA) of the student model, which generates final predictions for SED during inference. Experiments on the DCASE2018 task4 dataset demonstrate the ability of the proposed method. Specifically, an F1-score of 42.1% is achieved, significantly outperforming the 32.4% achieved by the winning system, or the 39.3% by the previous perturbation based method.},

  pages={3340-3344},
  abstract={Knowledge distillation refers to a technique of transferring the knowledge from a large learned model or an ensemble of learned models to a small model. This method relies on access to the original training set, which might not always be available. A possible solution is a data-free adversarial distillation framework, which deploys a generative network to transfer the teacher model’s knowledge to the student model. However, the data generation efficiency is low in the data-free adversarial distillation. We add an activation regularizer and a virtual interpolation method to improve the data generation efficiency. The activation regularizer enables the students to match the teacher’s predictions close to activation boundaries and decision boundaries. The virtual interpolation method can generate virtual samples and labels in-between decision boundaries. Our experiments show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art data-free distillation methods. The student model can achieve 95.42% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 77.05% accuracy on CIFAR-100 without any original training data. Our model’s accuracy is 13.8% higher than the state-of-the-art data-free method on CIFAR-100.},

  pages={205-216},
  abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are susceptible to various anomalies during their operations. Thus, it is important to detect such anomalies. Detecting such anomalies is challenging since it is uncertain when and where anomalies can happen. To this end, we present a novel approach called Anomaly deTection with digiTAl twIN (ATTAIN), which continuously and automatically builds a digital twin with live data obtained from a CPS for anomaly detection. ATTAIN builds a Timed Automaton Machine (TAM) as the digital representation of the CPS, and implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to detect anomalies. GAN uses a GCN-LSTM-based module as a generator, which can capture temporal and spatial characteristics of the input data and learn to produce realistic unlabeled adversarial samples. TAM labels these adversarial samples, which are then fed into a discriminator along with real labeled samples. After training, the discriminator is capable of distinguishing anomalous data from normal data with a high F1 score. To evaluate our approach, we used three publicly available datasets collected from three CPS testbeds. Evaluation results show that ATTAIN improved the performance of two state-of-art anomaly detection methods by 2.413%, 8.487%, and 5.438% on average on the three datasets, respectively. Moreover, ATTAIN achieved on average 8.39% increase in the anomaly detection capability with digital twins as compared with an approach of not using digital twins.},

Then, the deep deterministic policy gradient based reinforcement learning agent is trained on the digital twin model. The simulation of the reinforcement learning environment is based on a mixture of simulation engine and real signals. Thus, we can balance the training efficiency and the simulation accuracy.

  abstract={Buildings are one of the largest consumers of energy in the world and, as such, an opportunity for significant energy savings. Modelling of user behavior is a prerequisite for predicting the building energy consumption. It offers a possibility to adapt the building operation to best suit the user requirements while achieving minimal energy consumption through room air conditioning. This paper presents a deep learning model for prediction of an individual room temperature setpoint provided by the user. Model learning is conducted on the available dataset consisting of external weather and internal climate measurements. External weather conditions include the air temperature, relative humidity and direct, diffuse and global solar irradiation. The internal conditions refer to four offices for which the air temperature, the mode of operation of the fan coil controller and the temperature setpoints are available. The model is based on a neural network with Long Short-Term Memory. The highest accuracy is achieved with the model developed for the inputs of historical setpoints, system operation, day of the week and relative humidity. Presented results show high model accuracy, applicable for real-time model-based predictive building operation.},

  abstract={While noise is commonly considered a nuisance in computing systems, a number of studies in neuroscience have shown several benefits of noise in the nervous system from enabling the brain to carry out computations such as probabilistic inference as well as carrying additional information about the stimuli. Similarly, noise has been shown to improve the performance of deep neural networks. In this study, we further investigate the effect of adding noise in the knowledge distillation framework because of its resemblance to collaborative subnetworks in the brain regions. We empirically show that injecting constructive noise at different levels in the collaborative learning framework enables us to train the model effectively and distill desirable characteristics in the student model. In doing so, we propose three different methods that target the common challenges in deep neural networks: minimizing the performance gap between a compact model and large model (Fickle Teacher), training high performance compact adversarially robust models (Soft Randomization), and training models efficiently under label noise (Messy Collaboration). Our findings motivate further study in the role of noise as a resource for learning in a collaborative learning framework.},

  abstract={The power grid is considered to be the most critical piece of infrastructure in the United States because each of the other fifteen critical infrastructures, as defined by the Cyberse-curity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), require the energy sector to properly function. Due the critical nature of the power grid, the ability to detect anomalies in the power grid is of critical importance to prevent power outages, avoid damage to sensitive equipment and to maintain a working power grid. Over the past few decades, the modern power grid has evolved into a large Cyber Physical System (CPS) equipped with wide area monitoring systems (WAMS) and distributed control. As smart technology advances, the power grid continues to be upgraded with high fidelity sensors and measurement devices, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs), that can report the state of the system with a high temporal resolution. However, this influx of data can often become overwhelming to the legacy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, as well as, the power system operator. In this paper, we propose using a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) as a module within the Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems (ANGEL) Digital Twin environment to detect physical faults in a power system. The presented approach uses high fidelity measurement data from the IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 39-bus benchmark power systems to not only detect if there is a fault in the power system but also applies the algorithm to classify which bus contains the fault.},

  abstract={The latest advancements in digital and computational technologies are increasingly enabling original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to create digital `living' replicas of their products, commonly referred to as Digital Twins (DTs). This concept is especially relevant for Commercial Aerospace Industry (CAI) OEMs, whose business models rely heavily on high-quality service delivery, and learning about the status of each individual product could translate to cost savings of the order of millions of dollars. However, while extensive debate has taken place about the specifications of a complete, idealized DT, there is comparatively little discussion about the process and key decisions necessary for implementing such concept. This makes it difficult for managers and executives to devise strategies for implementing their DTs, as well as understanding where improvement is needed or where a competitive advantage exists. This work seeks to alleviate that gap through the development of a 10-dimension maturity model for DT implementations in CAI OEMs. Using a design science research methodology, the dimensions and their corresponding maturity levels are derived systematically. A novel framework for the derivation of maturity dimensions is presented as well. The maturity model will be helpful to industry practitioners in CAI OEMs who are seeking to benchmark their own DTs or develop an implementation strategy. For academics, this maturity model advances discussions about contextual DT implementation processes. Finally, a contribution is made to the maturity model development literature through the proposed maturity dimension derivation framework.},

Digital Twins (DTs) that reify this expertise and learn from it to address unforeseen challenges can significantly facilitate self-adaptive manufacturing where experience is very specific and, hence, insufficient to employ deep learning techniques. We leverage the explicit modeling of domain expertise through case-based reasoning to improve the capabilities of Digital Twins for adapting to such situations. To this effect, we present a modeling framework for self-adaptive manufacturing that supports modeling domain-specific cases, describing rules for case similarity and case-based reasoning within a modular Digital Twin. Automatically configuring Digital Twins based on explicitly modeled domain expertise can improve manufacturing times, reduce wastage, and, ultimately, contribute to better sustainable manufacturing.},

  abstract={Service Function Chaining realized with a microservice based architecture results in an increased number of computationally cheap Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Pinning cheap VNFs to dedicated CPU cores can waste resources since not every VNF fully utilizes its core. Thus, cheap VNFs should share CPU cores to improve resource utilization. sfc2cpu learns efficient VNF to core assignments that increase throughput and reduce latency compared to three baseline algorithms. To optimize VNF assignments, sfc2cpu uses game theory combined with Neural Combinatorial optimization in a novel way. Measurements in a real hardware testbed show that sfc2cpu increases throughput by up to 36% and reduces latency by up to 59% compared to Round Robin. We show that sfc2cpu can be incrementally deployed and easily integrated into existing infrastructures.},

  abstract={Digital twins employs simulation in conjunction with virtual environments and a variety of data coming from different plant equipment and physical systems to continuously update the digital models of the world in a feedback loop scheme to facilitate the decision-making processes. The heterogeneity of existing hardware and software requires the development of software architectures able to deal with the information exchange due to the integration and interaction of several system components and autonomous decision-making systems. In this work we propose the design and construction of a software architecture that integrates a manufacturing process simulator with the well-known robot operating system (ROS-Robot Operating System) to easily interchange information with an autonomous decision-making system. The proposal is tested with the simulator Tecnomatix and the free distribution ROS Melodic. We present an instance of software architecture for a typical complex case study of manufacturing plants and demonstrate its easy integration with an autonomous decision-making system based on the reinforcement- learning paradigm.},

  abstract={Cytopathology image analysis gives an important indication of the cervical carcinoma. Automation-assisted diagnosis has received more and more attention because of its high efficiency. Thanks to the development of artificial intelligence, supervised deep learning methods have shown promising results for cervical cell detection task. However, large amounts of labeled data are quite expensive and time-consuming for acquisition. In this paper, we propose a Classification and Localization Consistency Regularized Student-Teacher Network (CLCR-STNet) with online pseudo label mining to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data for semi-supervised cervical cell detection. Both classification and localization consistency regularization are introduced to ensure that the bounding boxes predicted by the student and teacher networks are consistent. Instead of sharing the network parameters with student model, our teacher model is updated using exponential moving average (EMA). Moreover, the teacher network is used to generate high-confidence pseudo labels for unlabeled data to provide student network with more supervised information. The experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms the supervised methods learned using labeled data only.},

  abstract={We present a semi-supervised teacher-student framework to improve classification performance on gastrointestinal image data. As labeled data is scarce in medical settings, this framework is built specifically to take advantage of vast amounts of unlabeled data. It consists of three main steps: (1) train a teacher model with labeled data, (2) use the teacher model to infer pseudo labels with unlabeled data, and (3) train a new and larger student model with a combination of labeled images and inferred pseudo labels. These three steps are repeated several times by treating the student as a teacher to relabel the unlabeled data and consequently train a new student. We demonstrate that our framework can classify both video capsule endoscopy (VCE) and standard endoscopy images. Our results indicate that our teacher-student framework can significantly increase the performance compared to traditional supervised-learning-based models, i.e., an overall increase in the F1-score of 4.7% for the Kvasir-Capsule VCE dataset and 3.2% for the HyperKvasir colonoscopy dataset. We believe that our framework can use more of the data collected at hospitals without the need for expert labels, contributing to overall better models for medical multimedia systems for automatic disease detection.},

  abstract={Digital twin technology and machine learning are emerging technologies in recent years. Through digital twin technology, it is virtually possible to virtualize a product, process or service and the information interaction and co-evolution between physical and information world. Machine Learning (ML) can improve the cognitive, reasoning and decision-making abilities of the digital twin through knowledge extraction. The full life cycle management of complex equipment is considered the key to the intelligent transformation and upgrading of the modern manufacturing industry. The application of the above two technologies in the full life cycle management of complex equipment is going to make each stage of the life cycle more responsive, predictable and adaptable. In this study, we have proposed a full life cycle digital twin architecture for complex equipment. We have described four specific scenarios in which two typical machine learning algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning are applied which are further used to enhance digital twin in various stages of complex equipment. At the end of this study, we have summarized the application advantages of the combination of digital twin and machine learning while addressing future research direction in this domain.},

  abstract={A digital twin is the virtual replica of a physical system. Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and autonomy of machines and products. Hence, the digital twin has been projected as the key enabler of the Visions of Industry 4.0. The digital twin concept has become increasingly sophisticated and capable over time, enabled by many technologies. In this paper, we propose the cognitive digital twin as the next stage of advancement of a digital twin that will help realize the vision of Industry 4.0. Cognition, which is inspired by advancements in cognitive science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, will enable a digital twin to achieve some critical elements of cognition, e.g., attention (selective focusing), perception (forming useful representations of data), memory (encoding and retrieval of information and knowledge), etc. Our main thesis is that cognitive digital twins will allow enterprises to creatively, effectively, and efficiently exploit implicit knowledge drawn from the experience of existing manufacturing systems and enable the transfer of higher performance decisions and control and improve the performance across the enterprise (at scale).

  abstract={The massive data generated by large-scale dynamic systems makes its optimization facing a tough challenge. Traditional White Box-based methods directly model the internal operating mechanism of the system, so massive amounts of measured data need to be handled, which is costly and time-consuming. The poor interpretability of the Black Box-based methods makes it difficult to adapt to the dynamic environment. Thus we propose a novel Gray Box-based approach namely Deep Reinforcement Learning-enabled Constraint Set Inversion Algorithm (DRESIA), which establishes a quantitative model of the nonlinear interoperability effects of system internal states which simplifies the White Box's complex mechanism of reconstruction and prediction and retains the interpretability of the model, therefore improves the prediction efficiency of feasible region while also improving the generalization ability. It further improves the dynamic adaptability of the modeling environment, which provides a new performance balancing scheme for system modeling. Under the premise that the large-scale 5G Cyber-Twin system satisfies the given Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, we perform DRESIA to realize the efficient and dynamic optimal search of feasible region, the results show that the DRESIA reduces the computational cost, and balances the accuracy and robustness of the feasible region, which validate the effectiveness and superiority of Gray Box-based approach.},

  abstract={Collaborative prognosis is a technique that enables the industrial assets to learn from similar other assets in a fleet, and improve their data-driven prognosis models. When collaborative prognosis is implemented in a computationally distributed framework, each asset is monitored by its corresponding Digital Twin agent. Distributed collaborative prognosis is particularly beneficial for high value assets where the communication and the processing costs are negligible compared to the maintenance costs. This paper analyses the effects of Digital Twin deployment strategies on the effectiveness of predictive maintenance activities relying on distributed collaborative prognosis. Distributed and heterarchical multi-agent system architectures are analysed for large fleets of assets, with varying failure rates and noise levels in the failure data. The results show that no single architecture or deployment strategy can be deemed best across all failure rates and noise levels. The conclusion derived in this paper provides guidance to the asset owners to choose the most suitable combination for a given application.},

In this article, we propose a wireless digital twin edge network model by integrating digital twin with edge networks to enable new functionalities, such as hyper-connected experience and low-latency edge computing. To efficiently construct and maintain digital twins in the wireless digital twin network, we formulate the edge association problem with respect to the dynamic network states and varying network topology. Furthermore, according to the different running stages, we decompose the problem into two subproblems, including digital twin placement and digital twin migration. Moreover, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to find the optimal solution to the digital twin placement problem, and then use transfer learning to solve the digital twin migration problem. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme provides reduced system cost and enhanced convergence rate for dynamic network states.},

This combination of characteristics renders the model uniquely suited to create digital twins of the converter which can run on any platform, including locally on the converter’s digital controller. The training dataset for the proposed neural network model can be generated from simulation (rather than measured on a hardware prototype) for convenience. This work will suggest a rationale for choosing the neural network structure and hyperparameters, will discuss best practices for training and testing the model, and will include an analysis of model error.

  abstract={The joint spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) is a two-phase precoding scheme for massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system under frequency division duplex (FDD) mode to reduce the amount of channel state information (CSI) feedback. To apply this scheme, users need to be partitioned into groups so that users in the same group have similar channel covariance eigenvectors while users in different groups have almost orthogonal eigenvectors. In this paper, taking the clustered user model into account, we consider the user grouping of JSDM for the downlink massive MIMO system with uniform planar antenna array (UPA) at base station (BS). A deep learning based user grouping algorithm is proposed to improve the efficiency of the user grouping process. The proposed grouping algorithm transfers the statistical CSI of all users into a picture, and utilizes the deep learning enabled objective detection model you look only once (YOLO) to divide the users into different groups rapidly. Simulation results show that the proposed user grouping scheme can achieve higher sum rate with less time delay.},

  abstract={The growing digitization of manufacturing processes is revolutionizing the production job-shop by leading it toward the Smart Manufacturing (SM) paradigm. For a process to be smart, it is necessary to combine a given blend of data technologies, information and knowledge that enable it to perceive its environment and to autonomously perform actions that maximize its success possibilities in its assigned tasks. Of all the different ways leading to this transformation, both the generation of virtual replicas of processes and applying artificial intelligence (AI) techniques provide a wide range of possibilities whose exploration is today a far from negligible sources of opportunities to increase industrial companies' competitiveness. As a complex manufacturing process, production order scheduling in the job-shop is a necessary scenario to act by implementing these technologies. This research work considers an initial conceptual smart digital twin (SDT) framework for scheduling job-shop orders in a zero-defect manufacturing (ZDM) environment. The SDT virtually replicates the job-shop scheduling issue to simulate it and, based on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methodology, trains a prescriber agent and a process monitor. This simulation and training setting will facilitate analyses, optimization, defect and failure avoidance and, in short, decision making, to improve job-shop scheduling.},

  abstract={The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern regarding the development of security monitoring and management mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.},

  abstract={The rapid growth and advancement of technology in industries provide a better quality of services to the end-user in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The digital twin (DT) is an innovative technology recently developed in Industry 4.0 to provide a virtual representation of physical components, products, or equipment such as computer numerical control (CNC) machines. It can be used to run simulations before manufacturing. However, traditional DT platforms lack data privacy, traceability, immutability, authentication of stakeholders. Moreover, manual prediction of the wearing of the tool condition of the CNC machine is challenging. Motivated from these gaps, in this paper, we propose a six-layered architecture for DT of CNC, which predicts CNC tool wear detection using a novel ensemble technique based soft voted prediction model consisting of XGBoost, random forest, and AdaBoost models. The proposed architecture also incorporates the public Ethereum blockchain (BC) to maintain the aforementioned issues of authentication, traceability, and transparency through constraints and automation programmed into the smart contracts (SC) developed. We evaluate the proposed scheme’s performance through simulation and compare it with other traditional approaches concerning several performance parameters (accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall). The result shows that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional approaches on these same performance parameters such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.},

  abstract={Convolutional neural network (CNN) has been applied to glioma classification, but there is no research result of CNN compression in this field. Lightweight CNN after compression provides the possibilities of deploying into a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or a memory limited hardware and further integrating into a medical electronic equipments. To solve the problem that CNNs are difficult to deploy to embedded devices and simple-scale CNNs have low accuracy in glioma grading, this paper proposes a method based on Knowledge Distillation to classify gliomas, and introduces an SE block into the model for improvement, so as to improve the performance with less parameters and computation.

  year={2021},

  pages={389-393},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for alleviating the negative transfer in multi-task learning. Multi-task learning aims to learn the general meta-knowledge via sharing inductive bias for improving generalization ability. However, there exists a negative transfer problem in MTL, in which the performance improvement of a specific task leads to performance degradation of other tasks. Multi-task learning is essentially a multi-objective problem because of the task competition, necessitating a trade-off in individual optimality. Inspired by knowledge distillation, a set of task-specific teacher models can transfer the knowledge to a student multi-task model, without signicifantly loss in performance. In other words, the individual optimality can be achieved via multi-teacher knowledge distillation, where each teacher model is optimal and contains sufficient general meta-knowledge. Therefore, we propose multi-task distillation to couple with the negative transfer, turning the multi-objective optimization problem into a multi-teacher knowledge distillation problem. In detail, we firstly collect the optimal task-specific teacher models, and then achieve the individual optimality of the student model by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiment results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over current state-of-the-art multi-task learning formulations and single-task training.},

  abstract={Computer-aided automatic cephalometric landmark localization has been a hot topic since last century. Recent proposed deep learning-based methods have made great contributions to this research topic. Among them, convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based regression is widely used, where ground-truth (GT) information is mainly used in the calculation of loss function, thus, mimics the difference between the predicted landmarks ' locations and the ground-truth locations through backpropagation. However, considering the limited number of annotated cephalometric data, we believe the performance can be better improved by better utilizing ground-truth information. In this paper, we propose a teacher-student learning method using GT images for accurate cephalometric detection. We first use images composed with GT landmarks as input images to train a detection model, which is treated as a teacher model. Then the teacher model is used to guide a student model, which is trained by original images, by transferring useful features. We believe the features between GT images and original images have similar domain distribution since they both represent same structure. We validate our method on public grand challenge dataset. Our method achieves better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

The student is trained using knowledge distilled from a more knowledgeable teacher model that can peek into the future and incorporate extra observations about the action in consideration. This framework can be used in both supervised and semi-supervised learning settings, being able to utilize both the labeled and unlabeled training data.

  abstract={The advances of mechatronic system design and system integration have shown improvements in functionality, performance and energy efficiency in many applications across industries, from autonomous ground vehicles and drones to conveyor belts. This trend has been adopted in some industries more than others. The design of equipment to handle granular or bulk material is commonly based on traditional approaches. Therefore, introducing mechatronic concepts in the design procedure can enable new possibilities, such as sensor integration and data analyses, adaptability and control. The efficiency of bulk material handling equipment in ports, agriculture and food processing is heavily influenced by the operational conditions. Typically, a piece of equipment is designed for defined operational conditions when the maximum performance can be achieved. In this work the concept of adaptability to varying operational conditions is explored by understanding the technologies implemented in other industries and the feasibility to be implemented in the bulk handling equipment design. Sensing technology, actuation and adaptability are systematically presented in this work to support the design process of the next generation of bulk handling equipment. This will pave the way for incorporating the technological trends in the design, such as: sustainability, “smartness”, Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, digital twin and machine learning. Adaptive mechatronic solutions will play a crucial role in generating and implementing innovative sustainable solutions for bulk handling equipment.},

  pages={119049-119066},
  abstract={Recent studies have recently exploited knowledge distillation (KD) technique to address time-consuming annotation task in semantic segmentation, through which one teacher trained on a single dataset could be leveraged for annotating unlabeled data. However, in this context, knowledge capacity is restricted, and knowledge variety is rare in different conditions, such as cross-model KD, in which the single teacher KD prohibits the student model from distilling information using cross-domain context. In this study, we aim to train a robust, lightweight student under the supervision of several expert teachers, which provide better instructive guidance compared to a single student-teacher learning framework. To be more specific, we first train five distinct convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as teachers for semantic segmentation on several datasets. To this end, several state-of-the-art augmentation transformations have also been utilized in training phase of our teachers. The impacts of such training scenarios are then assessed in terms of student robustness and accuracy. As the main contribution of this paper, our proposed multi-teacher KD paradigm endows the student with the ability to amalgamate and capture a variety of knowledge illustrations from different sources. Results demonstrated that our method outperforms the existing studies on both clean and corrupted data in the semantic segmentation task while benefiting from our proposed score weight system. Experiments validate that our multi-teacher framework results in an improvement of 9% up to 32.18% compared to the single-teacher paradigm. Moreover, it is demonstrated that our paradigm surpasses previous supervised real-time studies in the semantic segmentation challenge.},

  abstract={Although deep neural networks show their extraordinary power in various object detection tasks, it is very challenging for them to be deployed on resource constrained devices or embedded systems due to their high computational cost. Efforts such as model partition, pruning or quantization have been used at an expense of accuracy loss. Recently proposed knowledge distillation (KD) aims at transferring model knowledge from a well-trained model (teacher) to a smaller and faster model (student), which can significantly reduce the computational cost, memory usage, and prolong the battery lifetime. In this work, we propose a novel neuron manifold distillation (NMD), where the student models not only imitate teacher’s output activations, but also learn the feature geometry structure of the teacher. Our approach produces a high-quality, compact, and lightweight student model. We conduct comprehensive experiments with different distillation configurations over multiple datasets, and the proposed method demonstrates a consistent improvement in accuracy-speed trade-offs for the distilled model.},

  abstract={Accurately modelling user behaviour has the potential to significantly improve the quality of human-computer interaction. Traditionally, these models are carefully hand-crafted to approximate specific aspects of well-documented user behaviour. This limits their availability in virtual and augmented reality where user behaviour is often not yet well understood. Recent efforts have demonstrated that reinforcement learning can approximate human behaviour during simple goal-oriented reaching tasks. We build on these efforts and demonstrate that reinforcement learning can also approximate user behaviour in a complex mid-air interaction task: typing on a virtual keyboard. We present the first reinforcement learning-based user model for mid-air and surface-aligned typing on a virtual keyboard. Our model is shown to replicate high-level human typing behaviour. We demonstrate that this approach may be used to augment or replace human testing during the validation and development of virtual keyboards.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation has been used to transfer knowledge learned by a sophisticated model (teacher) to a simpler model (student). This technique is widely used to compress model complexity. However, in most applications the compressed student model suffers from an accuracy gap with its teacher. We propose extracurricular learning, a novel knowledge distillation method, that bridges this gap by (1) modeling student and teacher output distributions; (2) sampling examples from an approximation to the underlying data distribution; and (3) matching student and teacher output distributions over this extended set including uncertain samples. We conduct rigorous evaluations on regression and classification tasks and show that compared to the standard knowledge distillation, extracurricular learning reduces the gap by 46% to 68%. This leads to major accuracy improvements compared to the empirical risk minimization-based training for various recent neural network architectures: 16% regression error reduction on the MPIIGaze dataset, +3.4% to +9.1% improvement in top-1 classification accuracy on the CIFAR100 dataset, and +2.9% top-1 improvement on the ImageNet dataset.},

  abstract={As GAN-based video and image manipulation technologies become more sophisticated and easily accessible, there is an urgent need for effective deepfake detection technologies. Moreover, various deepfake generation techniques have emerged over the past few years. While many deepfake detection methods have been proposed, their performance suffers from new types of deepfake methods on which they are not sufficiently trained. To detect new types of deepfakes, the model should learn from additional data without losing its prior knowledge about deepfakes (catastrophic forgetting), especially when new deepfakes are significantly different. In this work, we employ the Representation Learning (ReL) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigms to introduce a transfer learning-based Feature Representation Transfer Adaptation Learning (FReTAL) method. We use FReTAL to perform domain adaptation tasks on new deepfake datasets, while minimizing the catastrophic forgetting. Our student model can quickly adapt to new types of deepfake by distilling knowledge from a pre-trained teacher model and applying transfer learning without using source domain data during domain adaptation. Through experiments on FaceForensics++ datasets, we demonstrate that FReTAL outperforms all baselines on the domain adaptation task with up to 86.97% accuracy on low-quality deepfakes.},

  abstract={With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, environmental monitoring systems using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have received considerable attention. Reliable object detection and tracking is an important research issue in various WSN applications, such as environment and disaster monitoring, disaster propagation tracking, and intruder monitoring and tracking. Generally, because batteries are used as energy sources for sensors in WSNs, a highly energy-efficient operation is needed to prolong the life of the sensors and networks. To save energy, sensors usually manage multi-mode sensing operations, in which they periodically switch between active and inactive periods. A tradeoff exists between object detection accuracy and energy efficiency when we select a sensing schedule. Depending on the object speed, direction, and sensor deployment topology, different sensing schedules should be dynamically applied to individual sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based dynamic duty cycle control method for sensor nodes. For RNN training, a target optimal duty cycle for a given network condition is derived from the proposed digital twin-space analytic solution. Simulation results show that the proposed model provides accurate object detection performance and achieves high energy efficiency.},

  abstract={Deep learning models are proven to deliver satisfactory results on training a complex non-linear relationship between the set of input features and different task outputs. However, they are memory intensive and require good computational power for both training as well as inferencing. In literature one can find different model compression techniques which enables easy deployment on edge devices. Knowledge distillation is one such approach where the knowledge of complex teacher model is transferred to a lower parameter student model. However, the limitation is that the architecture of the student model should be comparable to the complex teacher model for better knowledge transfer. Due to this limitation, we cannot deploy this student model that learns from a complex and huge teacher on edge devices. In this work, we propose to use a combined student approach wherein different student models learn from a common teacher model. Further, we propose a unique loss function which will train multiple student models simultaneously. An advantage of this approach is that these student models can be as simple as possible when compared with traditional single student model and also the complex teacher model. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation to prove that our approach can improve the overall accuracy significantly and allow a further compression by 10% when compared with generic model.},

However, those models are often too cumbersome, which sets a barrier to deploy them on the edge and improves the threshold of the pre-training process. In this paper, we propose Audio DistilBERT, a distilled BERT-style speech representation learning method. It learns dark knowledge from a larger teacher model through one new designed loss which combines soft and hard targets. By doing this, it can achieve competitive performance with fewer parameters and faster inference time. The experimental results among two downstream tasks show that the proposed method can retain above 98% performance of the large model with about 1.8× smaller model size and over 1.6× faster inference speed. In a low-resource environment with very few labeled data and pretraining steps, our model also exhibits similar or even better performance compared to the large model. Furthermore, we explore the knowledge transfer competence between the teacher and student model.},

  abstract={Existing methods for distillation do not efficiently utilize the training data. This work presents a novel approach to perform distillation using only a subset of the training data, making it more data-efficient. For this purpose, the training of the teacher model is modified to include self-regulation wherein a sample in the training set is used for updating model parameters in the backward pass either if it is misclassified or the model is not confident enough in its prediction. This modification restricts the participation of samples, unlike the conventional training method. The number of times a sample participates in the self-regulated training process is a measure of its significance towards the model's knowledge. The significance values are used to weigh the losses incurred on the corresponding samples in the distillation process. This method is named significance-based distillation. Two other methods are proposed for comparison where the student model learns by distillation and incorporating self-regulation as the teacher model, either utilizing the significance information computed during the teacher's training or not. These methods are named hybrid and regulated distillations, respectively. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed methods achieve similar performance as other state-of-the-art methods for knowledge distillation while utilizing a significantly less number of samples.},

However, it remains a challenging problem to balance between high accuracy and complexity of the speech enhancement models. To address this issue, we propose a novel speech enhancement framework that consists of a two-stage training module and a co-worker based speech enhancement network (Co-worker-SENet). In the training phase, we first train a teacher model to extract basic features. Then, a student model learns from the teacher at some early steps and further refines the features. Both the teacher and student models are Co-worker-SENet where a stack of feature extraction (FE) blocks is used to learn and refine the features. The FE block consists of multiple cheap workers, which extract features independently. Those features are then fused as the output of the FE block. We conduct extensive experiments on the commonly used VoiceBank-Demand dataset, and the experimental results show that the two-stage training framework can effectively improve the performance of the one-stage method and performs comparably to other state-of-the-art approaches with simple and cheap operations.},

  abstract={For classification tasks, deep neural networks are prone to overfitting in the presence of label noise. Although existing methods are able to alleviate this problem at low noise levels, they encounter significant performance reduction at high noise levels, or even at medium noise levels when the label noise is asymmetric. To train classifiers that are universally robust to all noise levels, and that are not sensitive to any variation in the noise model, we propose a distillation-based framework that incorporates a new subcategory of Positive-Unlabeled learning. In particular, we shall assume that a small subset of any given noisy dataset is known to have correct labels, which we treat as “positive”, while the remaining noisy subset is treated as “unlabeled”. Our framework consists of the following two components: (1) We shall generate, via iterative updates, an augmented clean subset with additional reliable “positive” samples filtered from “unlabeled” samples; (2) We shall train a teacher model on this larger augmented clean set. With the guidance of the teacher model, we then train a student model on the whole dataset. Experiments were conducted on the CIFAR-10 dataset with synthetic label noise at multiple noise levels for both symmetric and asymmetric noise. The results show that our framework generally outperforms at medium to high noise levels. We also evaluated our framework on Clothing1M, a real-world noisy dataset, and we achieved 2.94% improvement in accuracy over existing state-of-the-art methods.},

A machine-learning approach is explored for obtaining artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital twins of various types, including traditional (shallow) neural networks, deep belief networks, and deep convolutional networks for supervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning approaches. While several related approaches exist in the literature, they have generally been limited to simulations. By contrast, the goal of this work is to study the performance of state-of-art machine learning algorithms in an experimental framework using real-world test data obtained from a recently completed STAR front-end [1] . The proposed STAR front-end has measured bandwidths of better than 500 MHz across al-3 GHz range and provides better than 80 dB analog cancellation of self-interference. A dataset of experimental measurements of this front-end will be collected and applied to a suite of ML algorithms for self-interference cancellation that has recently appeared in the literature.

  abstract={This paper proposes a framework of digital twin-based integration of train regulation and control for metro systems. We study the integration of train regulation and train control by using deep learning and hybrid search methods. Specifically, a well-trained convolutional neural network is adopted to fit the nonlinear function mapping relationship between the input set (the line conditions and running time of the train in each section) and the output set (the energy consumption of the optimal speed profile and the switching points), which greatly reduces the calculation time of the optimal recommended speed profile in the process of train regulation. An integrated optimization model is proposed with the aim to minimize the total train delay and energy consumption, a hybrid search algorithm based on particle swarm optimization and a genetic algorithm was developed to solve the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified based on the actual operating data of a Beijing subway line.},

  abstract={Digital twin maps the physical plant to a real-time digital representation and facilities product design and decision-making processes. In this paper, we propose a novel digital twin-enabled reinforcement learning approach and apply it to an autonomous driving scenario. To further improve the data efficiency of reinforcement learning, which often requires a large amount of agent-environment interactions during the training process, we propose a digital-twin environment model that can predict the transition dynamics of the physical driving scene. Moreover, we propose a rollout prediction-compatible reinforcement learning framework, which is able to further improve the training efficiency. The proposed framework is validated in an autonomous driving task with a focus on lateral motion control. The simulation results illustrate that our method could significantly speed up the learning process and the resulting driving policy could achieve better performance, compared to the conventional reinforcement learning approach, which demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed digital-twin-enabled reinforcement learning method.},

  abstract={Laboratory intensive assignments and hands-on skills are important components in Mechatronics and Control Engineering by their nature. Like many other educational services, lots of the contents including laboratory studies are switched to remote learning due to COVID-19. In this work, the need for remote laboratory assignments is transformed into an opportunity to use Digital Twins in the education effectively. Laboratory assignments are designed on top of the concept of Digital Twin applications for the course “ME-142: Mechatronics” at the University of California, Merced. Basic mechatronics simulation skills are enhanced using the foundational applications in MATLAB/Simulink. After students reached high confidence level in the simulation environment, the concept of Digital Twins is introduced for subsequent laboratory assignments consisting identification, modeling, analysis, controller design and validation. Through the end of the semester, students are expected to work in groups of six for the course project to create their own applications of Digital Twin for a variety of systems. Finally, Digital Twin applications are posted online using MATLAB Web App Server to enhance accessibility and compensate the lack of hardware interaction.},

  abstract={With the increasing number of electric vehicles (EV), the smart transportation system is becoming more closely related to the smart energy system in a smart city. However, because of the high complexity, dynamics, and large-scale of these two systems, it is challenging to study their operation problems systematically, especially in severe conditions, e.g., the 2021 winter Texas power traffic crisis. With artificial intelligence, federated learning, edge computing, and automatic control, a digital twin based smart city is proposed in this paper and it focuses on two applications: smart transportation and smart energy grid. Both systems are presented in a structured design manner with several components in the digital twin system, which also contains many real-implementations of different scenarios. The proposed digital twin of a smart city provides a potential clue for the problems mentioned above.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},

  abstract={Recently developed large pre-trained language models, e.g., BERT, have achieved remarkable performance in many downstream natural language processing applications. These pre-trained language models often contain hundreds of millions of parameters and suffer from high computation and latency in real-world applications. It is desirable to reduce the computation overhead of the models for fast training and inference while keeping the model performance in downstream applications. Several lines of work utilize knowledge distillation to compress the teacher model to a smaller student model. However, they usually discard the teacher's knowledge when in inference. Differently, in this paper, we propose RemERT to leverage the knowledge learned from the teacher, i.e., facilitating the pre-computed BERT representation on the reference sample and compressing BERT into a smaller student model. To guarantee our proposal, we provide theoretical justification on the loss function and the usage of reference samples. Significantly, the theoretical result shows that including the pre-computed teacher's representations on the reference samples indeed increases the mutual information in learning the student model. Finally, we conduct the empirical evaluation and show that our RemERT can beat the vanilla TinyBERT over 8.1 % and achieves more than 94% of the performance of $\mathbf{BERT}_{\mathbf{BASE}}$ on the GLUE benchmark. Meanwhile, RemERT is $\mathbf{7.4x}$ smaller and $\mathbf{9.5x}$ faster on inference than $\mathbf{BERT}_{\mathbf{BASE}}$.},

  abstract={To reduce Operation and Maintenance (O&M) expenditure on offshore wind farms, wherein 80% of the cost relates to deploying personnel, the offshore wind sector looks to advances in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) for solutions. Barriers to residential Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) autonomy as a service, include operational challenges in run-time safety compliance, reliability and resilience, due to the complexities of dealing with known and unknown risk in dynamic environments. In this paper we incorporate a Symbiotic System Of Systems Approach (SSOSA) that uses a Symbiotic Digital Architecture (SDA) to provide a cyber physical orchestration of enabling technologies. Implementing a SSOSA enables Cooperation, Collaboration and Corroboration (C3), as to address run-time verification of safety, reliability and resilience during autonomous missions. Our SDA provides a means to synchronize distributed digital models of the robot, environment and infrastructure. Through the coordinated bidirectional communication network of the SDA, the remote human operator has improved visibility and understanding of the mission profile. We evaluate our SSOSA in an asset inspection mission within a confined operating environment. Demonstrating the ability of our SSOSA to overcome safety, reliability and resilience challenges. The SDA supports lifecycle learning and co-evolution with knowledge sharing across the interconnected systems. Our results evaluate both sudden and gradual faults, as well as unknown events, that may jeopardize an autonomous mission. Using distributed and coordinated decision making, the SSOSA enhances the analysis of the mission status, which includes diagnostics of critical sub-systems within the resident robot. This evaluation demonstrates that the SSOSA provides enhanced run-time operational resilience and safety compliance to BVLOS autonomous missions. The SSOSA has the potential to be a highly transferable methodology to other mission scenarios and technologies, providing a pathway to implementing scalable autonomy as a service.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the achievements of the QU4LITY project, funded by the Swiss Innovation Agency. Within this research project, the automation back-bone developed for the SUPSI MiniFactory [1], coupled with adaptive Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, is exploited to test numerous families of bearings. The MiniFactory is associated with an evolving digital profile, a digital twin, based on constant synchronization through IoT devices, that encompasses a massive, real-time, real-world data, gathered from the different sensors interfaced via OPC-UA protocol. This representation feeds a ML algorithm capable of 1) detecting defective bearings and 2) continually tuning the quality testing process parameters based on the analysis performed on the gathered data. Specifically, the identification of defective bearings is performed by a voting classifier fed by statistical metrics measured from the collected experiments. Our approach also aims at continually learning from the tests performed with the cell: the ML algorithm is tuned and adjusted every time a new set of tests is executed. Tests show that the proposed ML classifier accurately distinguishes damaged and uncorrupted bearings (accuracy ∼ 100%, precision ∼100%, recall ∼100%, TNR ∼100%). The digitalization of the quality control process is furtherly enriched by the development of a data aggregator platform. The platform fetches, cleans and aggregates data from every different machine belonging to the quality cell, enabling, also remotely, the pattern-tracking, the significant KPIs displaying and the comprehensive system behavior monitoring. The platform features also as HMI for the operator, who can monitor parameters and schedule new test campaigns.},

  abstract={AI is one of the biggest megatrends towards the 4th industrial revolution. Although these technologies promise business sustainability as well as product and process quality, it seems that the ever-changing market demands, the complexity of technologies and fair concerns about privacy, impede broad application and reuse of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models across the industry. To break the entry barriers for these technologies and unleash its full potential, the knowlEdge project will develop a new generation of AI methods, systems, and data management infrastructure. Subsequently, as part of the knowlEdge project we propose several major innovations in the areas of data management, data analytics and knowledge management including (i) a set of AI services that allows the usage of edge deployments as computational and live data infrastructure as well as a continuous learning execution pipeline on the edge, (ii) a digital twin of the shop-floor able to test AI models, (iii) a data management framework deployed along the edge-to-cloud continuum ensuring data quality, privacy and confidentiality, (iv) Human-AI Collaboration and Domain Knowledge Fusion tools for domain experts to inject their experience into the system, (v) a set of standardisation mechanisms for the exchange of trained AI models from one context to another, and (vi) a knowledge marketplace platform to distribute and interchange trained AI models. In this paper, we present a short overview of the EU Project knowlEdge –Towards Artificial Intelligence powered manufacturing services, processes, and products in an edge-to-cloud-knowledge continuum for humans [in-the-loop], which is funded by the Horizon 2020 (H2020) Framework Programme of the European Commission under Grant Agreement 957331.

  abstract={The research about the digital twin concept is growing worldwide, especially in the industrial sector, due to the increasing digitisation level associated to Industry 4.0. The application of the digital twin concept improves performance of a system by implementing monitoring, diagnosis, optimisation, and decision support actions. In particular, the decision-making process is very time consuming since the decision-maker is presented with hundreds of different scenarios that can be simulated and assessed in a what-if perspective. Bearing this in mind, this paper proposes to integrate a digital twin-based what-if simulation with a recommendation system to improve the decision-making cycle. The recommendation system is based on a reinforcement learning technique and takes user knowledge of the system into consideration and trust in the system recommendation. The applicability of the proposed approach is presented in an assembly line case study for recommending the best configurations for the system operation, in terms of the optimal number of AGVs (Autonomous Guided Vehicles) in various scenarios. The achieved results show its successful application and highlight the benefits of using AI-based recommendation systems for what-if simulation in digital twin systems.},

Samples of the same category are distributed in multiple regions of a PolSAR image, resulting in differences in the feature distributions of samples of the same category located in different regions. In addition, some samples of confusable categories, and samples of different categories located near the edges, have small feature differences in a PolSAR image. To address this problem, we introduce a graph regular loss constructed from pseudo-labels to constrain the intra-class similarity and inter-class similarity of features, and improve the discriminative property of features. In addition, since the quality of pseudo-labels affects the optimization of the model by the graph regular loss, we introduce the idea of clustering into the teacher-student model to improve the quality of pseudo-labels. Experiments on real PolSAR data show that our proposed method achieves an excellent performance.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={10-15},
  abstract={The use of industrial robots plays an increasingly important role in today’s production technology. Many fabrication processes like milling or gluing have high demands on accuracy and path smoothness to ensure good path tracking. Yet, industrial robot paths in cartesian space mainly consist of a sequence of linear and circular movements and hence show velocity and acceleration discontinuities in the segment transitions. This significantly limits the productivity and machining quality of the robot system. Traversing these discontinuities activates the kinematics mechanically and hence influences the accuracy and surface quality. In addition, the drives of the robot system are subjected to a higher load as a result which decreases the lifetime of the robot. Higher-order continuous paths are required to prevent this. Corner smoothing methods insert smooth, curvature continuous curves in the segment transition resulting in smooth paths. Methods based on polynomial smoothing splines either do not have any curvature-optimality properties or cannot be solved without violating the online constraints of the robot controller. To solve the conflict between the calculation of curvature-optimal smoothing curves and online execution in industrial robot controllers, this paper evaluates the use of neural networks as a model for calculating optimal geometry parameters for corner smoothing with polynomial splines. The model is trained applying supervised learning on a dataset containing offline generated pairs of geometries and optimal parameters. The presented method leads to curvature-optimized smoothing curves and is suitable for online path planning. The application of neural networks to this path planning problem is evaluated in a simulation using a digital twin model of an industrial robot.},

For sea ice classification, labeling the data precisely is very time consuming and requires expert knowledge. Our method efficiently learns sea ice characteristics from a limited number of labeled samples and a relatively large number of unlabeled samples. Therefore, our method addresses the key challenge of using a limited number of precisely labeled samples to achieve generalization capability by discovering the underlying sea ice characteristics also from unlabeled data. We perform experimental analysis considering a standard dataset consisting of properly labeled sea ice data spanning over different time slots of the year. Both qualitative and quantitative results obtained on this dataset show that our proposed TSLP-SSL method outperforms deep supervised and semisupervised reference methods.},

Upgrade of production processes towards this Industry 4.0 model is one of the critical challenges for the industrial sector and, consequently, the training of students and professionals has to address these new demands. To carry out this task, it is essential to develop educational tools that allow students to interact with real equipment that implements, in an integrated way, new enabling technologies, such as connectivity with standard protocols, storage and data processing in the cloud, machine learning, digital twins and industrial cybersecurity measures. For that reason, in this work, we present an educational environment on Industry 4.0 that incorporates these technologies reproducing realistic industrial conditions. This environment includes cutting-edge industrial control system technologies, such as an industrial firewall and a virtual private network (VPN) to strengthen cybersecurity, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateway to transfer process information to the cloud, where it can be stored and analyzed, and a digital twin that virtually reproduces the system. A set of hands-on tasks for an introductory automation course have been proposed, so that students acquire a practical understanding of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 and of its function in a real automation. This course has been taught in a master’s degree and students have assessed its usefulness by means of an anonymous survey. The results of the educational experience have been useful both from the students’ and faculty’s viewpoint.},

In this paper, we review the current research landscape as regards digital twins in the field of smart cities, while also attempting to draw parallels with the application of digital twins in Industry 4.0. Although digital twins have received considerable attention in the Industrial Internet of Things domain, their utilization in smart cities has not been as popular thus far. We discuss here the open challenges in the field and argue that digital twins in smart cities should be treated differently and be considered as cyber-physical “systems of systems”, due to the vastly different system size, complexity and requirements, when compared to other recent applications of digital twins. We also argue that researchers should utilize established tools and methods of the smart city community, such as co-creation, to better handle the specificities of this domain in practice.},

  abstract={With automated driving forthcoming, lane-changing for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) has received wide attention. The main challenge is that lane-changing requires not only local CAV control but also interactions with the surrounding traffic. Nevertheless, the Line-of-Sight (LoS) sensing range of the CAVs imposes severe limitations on lane-changing safety, and the lane-changing decision that is made based only on self-interest ignores its impact on the traffic flow efficiency. To overcome these difficulties, this article proposes a Digital Twin (DT) empowered mobile edge computing (MEC) architecture. With MEC, the sensing and computing capabilities of the CAVs can be strengthened to guarantee real-time safety. The virtualization and offline learning capabilities of the DT can be leveraged to enable the CAVs to learn from the experience of the physical MEC network and make lane-changing decisions via a ‘foresight intelligent’ approach. A case study of lane-changing is provided where the DT is constituted by a cellular automata based road traffic simulator coupled with a LTE-V based MEC network simulator. Deep reinforcement learning is adopted to train the lane-changing strategy and results validate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture.},

  abstract={Smart environments, such as Industry 4.0 or smart cities, are based on digital technologies that collect large amounts of data and artificial intelligence applications—or agents—to analyze this data and optimize various operational aspects of the environment. However, any intelligent environment must include humans. In this case, the interactions between humans and agents, referred to as human-agent interaction (HAI), will occur in complex arrangements involving multiple humans and agents interacting concurrently along with various scenarios. Agents’ ability to learn and perform their tasks is contingent on some degree of consistency in their interactions with humans. A lack of such consistency would jeopardize their learning and performance. It is thus necessary to integrate humans and agents across the entire environment consistently. Assuming that HAI is a complex system, the paper argues that ensuring HAI consistency can be achieved by deploying a new class of agents devoted to managing human-agent interactions, the Human Digital Twin (HDT). The proposed HDTs are placed alongside each human in the HAI environment to observe and learn about their interaction patterns and then use them to ensure HAI consistency.},

  abstract={The digital twin (DT) bridges the physical world with the digital world in real-time for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and federated learning (FL) enables edge intelligence services for IIoT under the premise of avoiding privacy leakage. The fusion of two technologies can extremely accelerate the development of Industry 4.0 by enabling instant intelligence services. However, in the resource-constrained IIoT, the energy consumption of performing FL and maintaining the virtual object in the digital space by DT technology become the bottlenecks and can not be ignored. To address these issues, in this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient FL framework for DT-enabled IIoT. In the proposed framework, IIoT devices choose different training methods considering dynamic time-varying environment status to achieve energy-efficient FL, i.e., either train locally or connect to the virtual object by DT in the corresponding server of a small base station (SBS) to train mapped data using computing resources of SBS. Then, we investigate the joint training method selection and resource allocation problem to minimize the energy consumption while satisfying the convergence rate of the training model. Considering the problem is intractable using traditional approaches, we use a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to solve it. Simulation results show that the proposed framework decreases greatly energy consumption compared with the static framework while satisfying the convergence rate of FL.},

  abstract={This paper presents a safe imitation learning approach for autonomous vehicle driving, with attention on real-life human driving data and experimental validation. In order to increase occupant's acceptance and gain drivers' trust, the autonomous driving function needs to provide a both safe and comfortable behavior such as risk-free and naturalistic driving. Our goal is to obtain such behavior via imitation learning of a planning policy from human driving data. In particular, we propose to incorporate barrier functions and smooth spline-based motion parametrization in the training loss function. The advantage is twofold: improving safety of the learning algorithm, while reducing the amount of needed training data. Moreover, the behavior is learned from highway driving data, which is collected consistently by a human driver and then processed towards a specific driving scenario. For development validation, a digital twin of the real test vehicle, sensors, and traffic scenarios are reconstructed toward high-fidelity and physics-based modeling technologies. These models are imported to simulation tools and co-simulated with the proposed algorithm for validation and further testing. Finally, we present experimental results and analyses, and compare with the conventional imitation learning technique (behavioral cloning) to justify the proposed development.},

  abstract={Semantic correspondence is a fundamental problem in computer vision, which aims at establishing dense correspondences across images depicting different instances under the same category. This task is challenging due to large intra-class variations and a severe lack of ground truth. A popular solution is to learn correspondences from synthetic data. However, because of the limited intra-class appearance and background variations within synthetically generated training data, the model’s capability for handling “real” image pairs using such strategy is intrinsically constrained. We address this problem with the use of a novel Probabilistic Model Distillation (PMD) approach which transfers knowledge learned by a probabilistic teacher model on synthetic data to a static student model with the use of unlabeled real image pairs. A probabilistic supervision reweighting (PSR) module together with a confidence-aware loss (CAL) is used to mine the useful knowledge and alleviate the impact of errors. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks show that our PMD achieves state-of-the-art performance. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we extend PMD to incorporate stronger supervision for better accuracy – the probabilistic teacher is trained with stronger key-point supervision. Again, we observe the superiority of our PMD. The extensive experiments verify that PMD is able to infer more reliable supervision signals from the probabilistic teacher for representation learning and largely alleviate the influence of errors in pseudo labels.

  pages={11013-11022},
  abstract={Data-driven based approaches, in spite of great success in many tasks, have poor generalization when applied to unseen image domains, and require expensive cost of annotation especially for dense pixel prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation. Recently, both unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from large amounts of synthetic data and semi-supervised learning (SSL) with small set of labeled data have been studied to alleviate this issue. However, there is still a large gap on performance compared to their supervised counterparts. We focus on a more practical setting of semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) where both a small set of labeled target data and large amounts of labeled source data are available. To address the task of SSDA, a novel framework based on dual-level domain mixing is proposed. The proposed framework consists of three stages. First, two kinds of data mixing methods are proposed to reduce domain gap in both region-level and sample-level respectively. We can obtain two complementary domain-mixed teachers based on dual-level mixed data from holistic and partial views respectively. Then, a student model is learned by distilling knowledge from these two teachers. Finally, pseudo labels of unlabeled data are generated in a self-training manner for another few rounds of teachers training. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework on synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation benchmarks.},

  abstract={Most existing distance metric learning approaches use fully labeled data to learn the sample similarities in an embedding space. We present a self-training framework, SLADE, to improve retrieval performance by leveraging additional unlabeled data. We first train a teacher model on the labeled data and use it to generate pseudo labels for the unlabeled data. We then train a student model on both labels and pseudo labels to generate final feature embeddings. We use self-supervised representation learning to initialize the teacher model. To better deal with noisy pseudo labels generated by the teacher network, we design a new feature basis learning component for the student network, which learns basis functions of feature representations for unlabeled data. The learned basis vectors better measure the pairwise similarity and are used to select high-confident samples for training the student network. We evaluate our method on standard retrieval benchmarks: CUB-200, Cars-196 and In-shop. Experimental results demonstrate that with additional unlabeled data, our approach significantly improves the performance over the state-of-the-art methods.},

  title={Revisiting Knowledge Distillation: An Inheritance and Exploration Framework}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},

  pages={3578-3587},
  abstract={Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a popular technique to transfer knowledge from a teacher model or ensemble to a student model. Its success is generally attributed to the privileged information on similarities/consistency between the class distributions or intermediate feature representations of the teacher model and the student model. However, directly pushing the student model to mimic the probabilities/features of the teacher model to a large extent limits the student model in learning undiscovered knowledge/features. In this paper, we propose a novel inheritance and exploration knowledge distillation framework (IE-KD), in which a student model is split into two parts - inheritance and exploration. The inheritance part is learned with a similarity loss to transfer the existing learned knowledge from the teacher model to the student model, while the exploration part is encouraged to learn representations different from the inherited ones with a dis-similarity loss. Our IE-KD framework is generic and can be easily combined with existing distillation or mutual learning methods for training deep neural networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these two parts can jointly push the student model to learn more diversified and effective representations, and our IE-KD can be a general technique to improve the student network to achieve SOTA performance. Furthermore, by applying our IE-KD to the training of two networks, the performance of both can be improved w.r.t. deep mutual learning.},

  volume={},

  pages={8183-8192},
  abstract={Recently unsupervised domain adaptation for the semantic segmentation task has become more and more popular due to high-cost of pixel-level annotation on real-world images. However, most domain adaptation methods are only restricted to single-source-single-target pair, and can not be directly extended to multiple target domains. In this work, we propose a collaborative learning framework to achieve unsupervised multi-target domain adaptation. An unsupervised domain adaptation expert model is first trained for each source-target pair and is further encouraged to collaborate with each other through a bridge built between different target domains. These expert models are further improved by adding the regularization of making the consistent pixel-wise prediction for each sample with the same structured context. To obtain a single model that works across multiple target domains, we propose to simultaneously learn a student model which is trained to not only imitate the output of each expert on the corresponding target domain, but also to pull different expert close to each other with regularization on their weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively exploit rich structured information contained in both labeled source domain and multiple unlabeled target domains. Not only does it perform well across multiple target domains but also performs favorably against state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods specially trained on a single source-target pair.

As it is difficult to have the same learning path that suits different learners, the Curriculum Sequencing problem (CS) consists of the generation of a personalized learning path for each learner according to his learner profile. This last one is represented through competencies. The proposed approach includes two components: (1) competency based approach that is used to represent the knowledge model and to deliver to the learner the learning path; and (2) a DNA computing approach based on a weighted graph is used to deliver a learning path to each learner.

  abstract={Machine Learning has the potential to discover new correlations between energy usage in apartments and variables such as seasonality, apartment location, size, efficiency and details of those staying in the apartments, thus helping apartments to become more sustainable and helping those who stay in them to use less energy. The biggest impedance to creating such ML tools is lack of viable data - without the data, the tools cannot be created - yet it is not feasible to wait for several years' worth of good data before creating the tools. Here we present a solution to this problem: the use of a digital twin to generate synthetic data. This approach is viable even when there is no existing data, but when expert knowledge about the relationship between systems exist. To achieve this, we develop a new agent-based synthetic data generator (ASDG) and explore a case study with a corporate housing and luxury alternate accommodation marketplace called TheSqua.re. We show that unlimited quantities of realistic data can be automatically generated, including data for different scenarios, and that it can be used by Machine Learning to discover the underlying correlations.},

However, this information is difficult to acquire especially in the fifth generation new radio (5G NR) frequency division duplex (FDD) systems with limited feedback. To tackle this challenge, different from previous works relying on Gaussian assumptions, we propose a digital twin-aided approach that directly learns the channel generative process from the limited feedback information via deep generative models.

  abstract={Adaptive learning technology solutions often use a learner model to trace learning and make pedagogical decisions. The present research introduces a formalized methodology for specifying learner models, logistic knowledge tracing (LKT), that consolidates many extant learner modeling methods. The strength of LKT is the specification of a symbolic notation system for alternative logistic regression models that is powerful enough to specify many extant models in the literature and many new models. To demonstrate the generality of LKT, we fit 12 models, some variants of well-known models and some newly devised, to six learning technology datasets. The results indicated that no single learner model was best in all cases, further justifying a broad approach that considers multiple learner model features and the learning context. We introduce features to stand in for student-level intercepts and argue that to be maximally applicable, a learner model needs to adapt to student differences. The results of our comparisons show the general importance of modeling recent learning for all datasets, with special importance for terms that model memory in datasets involving fact learning.},

  abstract={The goal is to explore the prediction performance of energy consumption in digital twins of the intelligent factory in the process of urbanization, so that it can provide good guidance for the green development of cities. The digital twin technology is introduced into the intelligent factory, in view of the influence of life cycle, data transmission delay and other factors of the equipment on product energy consumption of intelligent factory manufacturing in the real physical environment. Meanwhile, it is improved by DL (deep learning) algorithm to construct an improved AlexNet algorithm framework. Then, DPFS (Differential Privacy Frequent Subgraph) algorithm is adopted to build a digital twin energy consumption prediction model of intelligent factory based on DL and privacy algorithm. Finally, a simulation scenario is established to verify its performance. Through the comparative analysis of the digital twin energy consumption prediction model and other scholars’ models in related fields, the feature recognition accuracy of the constructed model reaches 89.23%, at least 1.95% higher than that of other neural network models. From the perspective of energy consumption data transmission performance, the data message delivery rate of the proposed model is not less than 80%. Besides, the data message leakage rate and packet loss rate are less than 11%, and the average delay is basically stable. Therefore, the constructed model can achieve high energy consumption data transmission security performance under the premise of ensuring the prediction accuracy, which can provide experimental basis for the prediction of energy consumption and the improvement of security maintenance performance in intelligent factories.},

  abstract={The digital twin paradigm is a promising enabling technology to accelerate the decarbonisation of industrial sites that use process heat. With digital representations that look-like, behave-like, and connect to a physical system, digital twins bring together critical operational and asset data into a single knowledge store. However, a high-fidelity digital twin relying on the cloud in real-time with direct influence on operations exposes the plant to cyber attacks. We propose a software architecture for a Digital Twin that adaptively generates more accurate representations of its operations to detect malicious activities and mitigate their effects. To achieve this adaptivity, our solution leverages ML, time-series forecasting, concept drift detection and control stability analysis. To evaluate our solution, we develop a simulation of a simple industrial plant consisting of one PID-controlled steam-boiler and a variety of uncertainties. Our experimental evaluation suggests that Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control, a system identification technique, best contributes towards Self-Learning by producing verifiable models that better align the need for retraining with concept drifts.},

  abstract={This work has been initiated for the 2nd Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW 2021) competition. We train a unified deep learning model on multi-databases to perform two tasks: seven basic facial expressions prediction and valence-arousal estimation. Since these databases do not contain labels for all the two tasks, we have applied the distillation knowledge technique to train two networks: one teacher and one student model. Both of these models are based on CNN-RNN hybrid architecture. The student model will be trained using both ground truth labels and soft labels derived from the pretrained teacher model. During the training, we have added one more task, which is the combination of the two mentioned tasks, for better exploiting inter-task correlations. We also exploit the sharing videos between the two tasks of the AffWild2 database that is used in the competition for further improving the performance of the network. Experiment results show that with these improvements, our model has reached the performance on par with the state of the art on the test set of the competition.

In the actual workshop, it is quite difficult to achieve to sufficient data to train a diagnosis model with high reliability, and the test data do not follow the same distribution under different working condition which traditional data-based fault diagnosis rely on. In this paper, we present a digital-twin-assisted bearing fault diagnosis method to solve the difficulty in achieving fault data and training fault diagnosis model under dynamic working condition. Firstly, by relying on the digital twin virtual workshop, massive fault data is provided to train the fault diagnosis model, and transfer this model to the actual workshop to avoid the waste in time and knowledge.

  pages={179-184},
  abstract={Digital twin has the characteristics of high- fidelity behavior simulation, and deep learning has powerful data mining capabilities. Our country's port and hydraulic building facilities are now the world's largest, most of which are concrete structures. However, there will be more freeze-thaw damage to concrete structures, and there is less research on the durability test methods of hydraulic structures, especially the life prediction of hydraulic structures after freeze-thaw damage repairs. Based on this, this article has launched a research on the durability life prediction technology of port hydraulic structures driven by the integration of digital twins and deep learning. Aiming at the difficult problem of predicting and maintaining the status of port hydraulic buildings in a harsh working environment, combined with the high-fidelity behavior simulation characteristics of digital twins and the powerful data mining capabilities of deep learning, this paper mainly studies the mutual driving of digital twins and deep learning. In this paper, multiple digital twins of the shearer are constructed based on multiple physical and spatial parameters. Through multiple visual displays and data analysis in the virtual space, the health status is predicted, and a port based on deep machine learning is established. The residual life prediction model of the key parts of hydraulic structures realizes real-time monitoring on the network; integrates the residual life and residual life value of the building parts driven by data, and integrates the status of the digital twin and the residual life of the parts and the port Durability assessment of hydraulic construction buildings. The research results show that although a little steel slag can significantly improve the heat resistance and compressive strength of concrete, when the content of steel slag exceeds a certain meaning, the heat resistance and compressive strength of concrete will change. When the steel slag content reaches 10%, the effect is best. When the steel slag content reaches 20%, the 28d concrete compressive strength and strength will not have a big impact.},

  abstract={Semantic representation of motions in a human-robot collaborative environment is essential for agile design and development of digital twins (DT) towards ensuring efficient collaboration between humans and robots in hybrid work systems, e.g., in assembly operations. Dividing activities into actions helps to further conceptualize motion models for predicting what a human intends to do in a hybrid work system. However, it is not straightforward to identify human intentions in collaborative operations for robots to understand and collaborate. This paper presents a concept for semantic representation of human actions and intention prediction using a flexible task ontology interface in the semantic data hub stored in a domain knowledge base. This semantic data hub enables the construction of a DT with corresponding reasoning and simulation algorithms. Furthermore, a knowledge-based DT concept is used to analyze and verify the presented use-case of Human-Robot Collaboration in assembly operations. The preliminary evaluation showed a promising reduction of time for assembly tasks, which identifies the potential to i) improve efficiency reflected by reducing costs and errors and ultimately ii) assist human workers in improving decision making. Thus the contribution of the current work involves a marriage of machine learning, robotics, and ontology engineering into DT to improve human-robot interaction and productivity in a collaborative production environment.},

  abstract={Pipelines are used to transport liquids and gases between different places. In recent years, identifying the location and size of cracks in transmission pipes has received much attention. Thus, in this research, the combination of fuzzy digital twin (FDT), support vector machine (SVM), and backstepping (BS) observer is suggested for leak detection and localization. In the first stage, the proposed fuzzy digital twin is introduced. So, first, the flow rate in the healthy condition is modeled using the fuzzy Gaussian process Regression (FGR) which is a combination of Gaussian process Regression (GR) and fuzzy algorithm. After that, in the second stage, the flowrate signals are estimated using the fuzzy digital twin that is a combination of FGR, BS technique, and fuzzy procedure. The proposed FDT is used to modeling and estimated the flow rate in the pipeline in normal and abnormal conditions. Moreover, it can be used for data generation. After modeling and estimated data using FDT, in the next step, the residual data is generated to improve the accuracy of crack localization. Next, the crack is detected by the combination of the SVM and FDT. To find the location of the crack, the combination of FDT and the backstepping algorithm is suggested. The Ulsan Industrial Artificial Intelligence (VIAl) Lab dataset is used to test the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The results show that the proposed FDT is 25% improved in the accuracy for fault localization compared with the classical digital twin.},

  abstract={Perceptual audio quality assessment is a task that involves the characterization and estimation of perceived quality of an audio signal. Many existing systems, depending on psychoacoustic principles and statistical models, achieve reasonable performance under specific conditions (e.g., type of artifacts, impairment levels, etc.) but do not generalize well when these conditions vary. This lack of generality often limits their utility in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by leveraging the domain knowledge from several state-of-the-art expert systems. Particularly, we explore the idea of training a multitask student model using unlabeled data and the pseudo labels from multiple expert (i.e. teacher) systems. Evaluation is conducted using a variety of test datasets, and the results show that our proposed system compares favorably with the state-of-the-art systems and achieves the highest overall performance.},

  abstract={The energy efficiency of the metallurgy is becoming more and more important today due to the permanently growing requirements to the final product quality. One of the modern methods to increase it is the production digitalization, which is mostly based on the concept of “Digital Twins” or “Digital Shadows” of technologically processes or units. As far as the metallurgy is concerned, the units with the highest energy consumption are furnaces. This fact makes it actual to try to develop “Digital Twins” of such furnaces. One of the main constituent parts of the “Digital Twin” is a kind of a mathematical model, such as finite-difference or data-based ones. In this research: 1) the finite-difference model of the steel heating process, which is based on the differential equation of transient heat conduction, is developed; 2) the obtained finite-difference model is compared with the data-based one, which is obtained as a result of application of the machine learning algorithms and extreme gradient boosting method modification (DART) to the data obtained from the furnace; 3) conclusions are made on the advantages and disadvantages of these models. The data-based model error is 7.4 degrees Celsius lower than the one obtained with the help of the finite-difference model.},

  abstract={In realistic speech enhancement settings for end-user devices, we often encounter only a few speakers and noise types that tend to reoccur in the specific acoustic environment. We propose a novel personalized speech enhancement method to adapt a compact denoising model to the test-time specificity. Our goal in this test-time adaptation is to utilize no clean speech target of the test speaker, thus fulfilling the requirement for zero-shot learning. To complement the lack of clean speech, we employ the knowledge distillation framework: we distill the more advanced denoising results from an overly large teacher model, and use them as the pseudo target to train the small student model. This zero-shot learning procedure circumvents the process of collecting users' clean speech, a process that users are reluctant to comply due to privacy concerns and technical difficulty of recording clean voice. Experiments on various test-time conditions show that the proposed personalization method can significantly improve the compact models' performance during the test time. Furthermore, since the personalized models outperform larger non-personalized baseline models, we claim that personalization achieves model compression with no loss of denoising performance. As expected, the student models underperform the state-of-the-art teacher models.},

  abstract={Discrete Event Simulations (DES) are the most commonplace tools for modelling today's manufacturing factories and their processes. DES are becoming steadfastly integrated into their corresponding physical counterparts to administer greater avenues for their analysis, control, forecasts and optimisations in real-time. However, this growth does not materialise without a penalty in the form of computational burden. The demand for flexible and alternate approaches to accelerate DES is made necessary. Hence, the utilisation of GPUs to comply with such acceleration presents a research topic of growing interest. This work investigates the use of the Machine Learning platform TensorFlow with GPUs to accelerate a variety of manufacturing-domain DES using the SimPy simulation framework. A range of results were gathered, of speed-ups spanning between x1.4 and x3.21, paving the way for further enhancements towards the vision of real-time communication between simulation and physical system in the form of a complete Digital Twin.},

  abstract={There is a growing interest in designing robots that can work alongside humans. Such robots will undoubtedly be expected to explain their behavior and decisions. While generating explanations is an actively researched topic, most works tend to focus on methods that generate explanations that are one size fits all. As in the specifics of the user-model are completely ignored. The handful of works that look at tailoring their explanation to the user’s background rely on having specific models of the users (either analytic models or learned labeling models). The goal of this work is thus to propose an end-to-end adaptive explanation generation system that begins by learning the different types of users that the robot could interact with. Then during the interaction with the target user, it is tasked with identifying the type on the fly and adjust its explanations accordingly. The former is achieved by a data-driven clustering approach while for the latter, we compile our explanation generation problem into a POMDP. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system on two domains using state-of-the-art POMDP solvers. We also report the results of a user study that investigates the benefits of providing personalized explanations in a human-robot interaction setting.},

  abstract={Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful mathematical framework that allows robots to learn complex skills by trial-and-error. Despite numerous successes in many applications, RL algorithms still require thousands of trials to converge to high-performing policies, can produce dangerous behaviors while learning, and the optimized policies (usually modeled as neural networks) give almost zero explanation when they fail to perform the task. For these reasons, the adoption of RL in industrial settings is not common. Behavior Trees (BTs), on the other hand, can provide a policy representation that a) supports modular and composable skills, b) allows for easy interpretation of the robot actions, and c) provides an advantageous low-dimensional parameter space. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that can learn the parameters of a BT policy in simulation and then generalize to the physical robot without any additional training. We leverage a physical simulator with a digital twin of our workstation, and optimize the relevant parameters with a black-box optimizer. We showcase the efficacy of our method with a 7-DOF KUKAiiwa manipulator in a task that includes obstacle avoidance and a contact-rich insertion (peg-in-hole), in which our method outperforms the baselines.},

  abstract={Intelligent fault detection is a mechanism’s competency to distinguish between healthy and faulty machine signals for smart and efficient diagnosis. The modelling and analysis of the parameters that contribute to the system’s fundamental operation form the crux of the framework. A heuristic technology to enable real-time intelligent fault detection is digital twin technology. Digital twin technology allows a tandem establishment between real-world machines and the virtual domain, allowing for the inclusion of optimization and maintenance frameworks. Sparsely represented machines in the digital twin domain are linear actuators, which form essential parts of various industrial and commercial machines. Therefore, this study has modelled a data-driven and multi-physics robotic linear actuator digital twin, and integrated it with a custom designed fault detection mechanism using Naïve Bayes classifier. This architecture can autonomously be deployed in tandem to the physical machine to alarm and diagnose electrical faults as soon as they occur in the machine. As compared with conventional diagnostics this will reduce machine down-time and expedite repairs. The resultant model built on MATLAB, Simulink gave an accuracy of 96% and required minimal processing capability to operate. Widespread commercial utilization of the proposed model can pave the path for Industry 4.0 utilization of linear actuators as well as technologies including industrial robots that utilize them.},

  abstract={The typical optimization and control activities of Digital Twins are driven by high-performance simulators. Due to the significant complexity of systems subject to digital twinning, constructing simulators of appropriate details is a costly and error-prone endeavor. To alleviate these problems, we propose an approach for inferring simulation models of Digital Twins by machine learning. Instead of learning the simulation model of one specific simulator, we aim at learning their construction process. This generality enables reusing the inferred knowledge in different (but congruent) Digital Twin settings. To achieve this level of generality, we propose the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism for capturing simulation models; and reinforcement learning (RL) for inferring DEVS models. In this paper, we explore the opportunities and challenges in combining these two techniques.},

  abstract={This Research Full Paper presents a systematic review on knowledge tracing of learning programming based on student performance data in exercises. Programming has become an essential skill to solve realworld problems in modern engineering disciplines. However, when students start to learn how to program, they face a lot of challenges in acquiring various programming knowledge and skills. While it is beneficial to customise learning material to fit individual learning progress, the widely different learning pace of students in an introductory programming course has made it impractical for teachers to track the knowledge acquisition of individual. Hence, many recent works take a data-driven approach to model students' learning progress based on the performance data in programming-related exercises, which include the submitted program codes and answers to closed-ended programming exercises. By analyzing these performance data, a system can evaluate the students' knowledge level of various concepts and skills in programming. This paper performs a systematic review and reports key information about recent works on programming knowledge tracing based on student performance data. An overview of the different choices of knowledge representation, domain knowledge model, performance measure and knowledge tracing algorithms is provided. The nature and granularity of knowledge components and the relationships between them are compared across the reviewed works. The different choice of programming knowledge representation leads to varied methods to assess knowledge levels from empirical performance data in programming-related exercises. Two broad categories of works are identified. The first is to overlay a student model on the domain knowledge model, and the student knowledge levels are updated in distinct time steps. The second trains temporal knowledge tracing models to predict students' future performance based on their performance in previous exercises. In addition, this review discusses the distinct challenges in knowledge tracing in programming education. It also points out limitations in current works and opportunities to improve knowledge tracing in learning programming.},

  abstract={The product companies are going towards Digital Transformation for digital customer experience. This is effective for marketing and sales specially during the pandemic. For the product visualization, it is necessary to create multiple 2D views of a product which is a cumbersome and time-consuming process especially when there are copious number of products. Traditional rendering techniques and image augmentation for dataset generation either take quite a lot of time or do not yield photo-realistic images. The recent progress in generative models and 3D deep learning provide a promising avenue in this regard. This paper explores different techniques for rendering photo-realistic 2D images from 3D CAD models. This study compares the performance of three different models pix2pix, Pytorch3D and SynSin based on three different approaches namely image-to-image translation, mesh rendering, and view synthesis respectively to generate photo-realistic images. The models are tested using the dataset provided by Schneider Electric. Results demonstrate that Pytorch3D is the better model to generate photo-realistic images. These approaches can emerge as the initial steps for digital twin technology.},

  pages={166-177},
  abstract={The energy consumption footprint of Passive Optical Networks (PONs) is high due to its widespread deployment. Therefore, a large and growing body of literature has investigated how energy consumption in PONs can be minimized. Existing research indicates that sleep mode is an effective means for reducing energy consumption in PONs. There is also a growing number of contributions that demonstrate the importance of integrating PON with Software-defined Networking (SDN). Such integration facilitates a programmable PON, which can dynamically adjust its operation on-the-fly based on the decision made by a SDN controller. The most important limitations in the previous energy-efficient PON research lies in the fact that they failed to address how the energy saving and traffic performance can be fed in real-time into the network operation decision process. Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging field of research in the communication networking area. DT can bridge between real and virtual world making a significant contribution in defining optimal operation of the network. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Digital-twin-assisted Software-defined PON framework in order to feed the network performance data in real-time to the network operation decision support system, which aims at maximizing energy conservation while meeting quality of service, and control PON infrastructure on-the-fly. Our DT based solution also integrates a supervised learning Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method for making traffic arrival forecasts based on time series traffic traces. The initial findings of our research based on a C++ discrete event simulator show that the proposed solution successfully reduces energy consumption while meeting traffic delay requirements in a PON.},

  abstract={Vehicle platooning is one of the advanced driving applications expected to be supported by the 5G vehicle to everything (V2X) communications. It holds great potentials on improving road efficiency, driving safety and fuel efficiency. Apart from the organization and internal communication of the platoons, real-time prediction of surrounding road users (such as vehicles and cyclists) is another critical issue. While artificial intelligence (AI) is receiving increasing interests on its application to trajectory prediction, there is a potential problem that the pre-trained neural network models may not well fit the current driving environment and needs online fine-tuning to maintain an acceptable high prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a digital twin based real-time trajectory prediction scheme for platoons of connected intelligent vehicles. In this scheme the head vehicle of a platoon senses the surrounding vehicles. A LSTM neural network is applied for real-time trajectory prediction with the sensing outcomes. The head vehicle controls the offloading of the trajectory data and maintains a digital twin to optimize the update of LSTM model. In the digital twin a Deep-Q Learning (DQN) algorithm is utilized for adaptive fine tuning of the LSTM model, to ensure the prediction accuracy and minimize the consumption of communication and computing resources. A real-world dataset is developed from the KITTI datasets for simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed trajectory prediction scheme can maintain a prediction accuracy for safe platooning and reduce the delay of updating the neural networks by up to 40%.},

For this reason, the proposed digital twin model realizes the synchronization and real-time update of the physical entities of the power system, and obtains more accurate and faster prediction results than traditional prediction methods. The model uses S-LSTM as the core of the digital twin system, trains the S-LSTM model through RMSProp adaptive learning algorithm, constrains the learning rate, obtains the best parameters, and improves the model&#x0027;s adaptability to different types of data. The simulation results show that compared with other prediction methods, it verifies the effectiveness and feasibility of the method proposed in this paper.},

  volume={},

  pages={1533-1538},
  abstract={Advances in modeling and computation have resulted in high-fidelity digital models capable of simulating the dynamics of a wide range of industrial systems. These models often require calibration, or the estimation of an optimal set of parameters, to reflect a system’s observed behavior. While searching over the parameter space is an inevitable part of the calibration process, models are seldom designed to be valid for arbitrarily large parameter spaces. Application of existing black-box calibration methods, therefore, often require repeatedly evaluating a model over a wide range of parameters. For some parameter combinations, the simulations could be unreasonably slow or fail altogether. In general, the shape of subregions in the parameter space that could result in simulation failure is unknown and near-impossible to ascertain analytically. In this paper, we propose a novel failure robust Bayesian optimization (FR-BO) algorithm that learns these failure regions from simulation data and informs a Bayesian optimization algorithm to avoid failure regions while searching for optimal parameters. This results in acceleration of the optimizer’s convergence and prevents wastage of time trying to simulate parameters with high failure probabilities.},

In this paper, we propose a novel method named efficient facial landmark detector (EFLD), which significantly compresses the model size and computational cost while achieving superior performance compared with state-of-the-art frameworks. We introduce a knowledge distillation framework suitable for facial landmark detection, which can transfer geometric information from the pre-trained teacher model to the lightweight student model. In addition, we integrate adversarial learning into the knowledge distillation framework to guide the student model to imitate the heatmap distribution generated by the teacher model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.},

No matter how smart and powerful an AI model we can build, the ultimate testimony of the success of data science and AI is users’ trust. How can we build trustworthy data science? At the level of user-model interaction, how can we convince users that a data analytic result is trustworthy? At the level of group-wise collaboration for data science and AI, how can we ensure that the parties and their contributions are recognized fairly, and establish trust between the outcome (e.g., a model built) of the group collaboration and the external users? At the level of data science participant eco-systems, how can we effectively and efficiently connect many participants of various roles and facilitate the connection among supplies and demands of data and models? In this talk, I will brainstorm possible directions to the above questions in the context of an endto-end data science pipeline. To strengthen trustworthy interactions between models and users, I will advocate exact and consistent interpretation of machine learning models. Our recent results show that exact and consistent interpretations are not just theoretically feasible, but also practical even for API-based AI services. To build trust in collaboration among multiple participants in coalition, I will review some progress in ensuring fairness in federated learning, including fair assessment of contributions and fairness enforcement in collaboration outcome. Last, to address the need of trustworthy data science eco-systems, I will review some latest efforts in building data and model marketplaces and preserving fairness and privacy. Through reflection I will discuss some challenges and opportunities in building trustworthy data science for possible future work.},

  abstract={Smart Cities will create many benefits for society. One of the most significant will be real-time, active management of the systems making up a Smart City. Active management will be enabled by processing large amounts of real-time data, by machine learning to deliver timely insights and by large-scale simulation to create effective interventions. To realise active management of Smart Cities requires processing systems that can take in data at large volume and variety, and perform complex processing on these data, all in real-time. Digital twins are used to create a continuous, consistent view of the current state of the city, and simulation of the evolution of digitals twins is used to detect problems arising in the near future and to optimise the impact of interventions. In this paper we propose and validate a Smart City processing architecture that can deliver these benefits by building a digital twin of a city, combining real-time streamed data ingestion, simulation and analytics. Streamed data systems can deliver a real time response with large amount of incoming data but are not suited to time advancing simulations where the interaction between modelled objects is important. We propose a processing architecture that mitigates this limitation by separating object interactions from streamed data processing. Finally, we introduce DEDUCE-PT, a demonstration implementation of this Smart City processing architecture that is aimed at proactive management of public transport systems.},

  abstract={Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been considered as a key solution in model compression and acceleration in recent years. In KD, a small student model is generally trained from a large teacher model by minimizing the divergence between the probabilistic outputs of the two. However, as demonstrated in our experiments, existing KD methods might not transfer critical explainable knowledge of the teacher to the student, i.e. the explanations of predictions made by the two models are not consistent. In this paper, we propose a novel explainable knowledge distillation model, called XDistillation, through which both the performance the explanations’ information are transferred from the teacher model to the student model. The XDistillation model leverages the idea of convolutional autoencoders to approximate the teacher explanations. Our experiments shows that models trained by XDistillation outperform those trained by conventional KD methods not only in term of predictive accuracy but also faithfulness to the teacher models.},

  abstract={Although researches on the dialogue system with deep learning methods have achieved good performance, medical dialogue generation confronts particular difficulties against other domains. As requiring highly accurate replies, many different types of external guidance signals are provided in previous studies to control the output and increase faithfulness. However, how these strategies compare and combine to each other is not known. In light of these challenges, we propose a multi-guidance model with bidirectional distillation for medical dialogue generation. Firstly, we fuse different guidance signals (keywords, categories and summaries) with neural sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model as teacher models. Meanwhile, we consider a simplified model without guidance as the student model. We also propose an attention mechanism to ensemble for the fusion of knowledge from multiple teachers. We further develop a bidirectional distillation module to exchange the knowledge between the teachers and a student from both sides during the training process. Through extensive experiments on medical dataset, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over state-of-the-art ones.},

  abstract={Deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance in various healthcare applications. However, the major limitation of these deep models is usually the lack of high-quality training data due to the private and sensitive nature of this field. In this study, we propose a novel textual data augmentation method to generate artificial clinical notes in patients’ Electronic Health Records (EHRs) that can be used as additional training data for patient outcomes prediction. Essentially, we fine-tune the generative language model GPT-2 to synthesize labeled text with the original training data. More specifically, We propose a teacher-student framework where we first pre-train a teacher model on the 0riginal data, and then train a student model on the GPT-augmented data under the guidance of the teacher. We evaluate our method on the most common patient outcome, i.e., the 30-day readmission rate. The experimental results show that deep models can improve their predictive performance with the augmented data, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation in machine learning is the process of transferring knowledge from a large model called teacher to a smaller model called student. Knowledge distillation is one of the techniques to compress the large network (teacher) to a smaller network (student) that can be deployed in small devices such as mobile phones. When the network size gap between the teacher and student increases, the performance of the student network decreases. To solve this problem, an intermediate model is employed between the teacher model and the student model known as the teaching assistant model, which in turn bridges the gap between the teacher and the student. In this research, we have shown that using multiple teaching assistant models, the student model (the smaller model) can be further improved. We combined these multiple teaching assistant model using weighted ensemble learning where we have used a differential evaluation optimization algorithm to generate the weight values.},

  abstract={Machine comprehension of text is a critical problem in natural language processing (NLP). However, there are severe data imbalance problems in extractive machine reading comprehension (MRC) tasks: unbalanced data will lead to differences between training and testing. Without a balanced label, the learning process tends to meet to a point, strongly biasing towards the class and the majority of labels. The most used cross-entropy criteria are accuracy-oriented, mainly focusing on the majority class to achieve high accuracy. Another problem is that the training of the model only introduces correct knowledge, which is not accurate enough for answer prediction. To address these issues, we propose to use focal loss in replacement of the standard cross-entropy objective for data imbalanced MRC tasks, which uses weight coefficients to adjust the weight of positive and negative samples and distinguish between easy and difficult samples. We propose using the same model to perform mirror distillation so that the teacher model can provide the correct and wrong knowledge for the student model to learn, obtain better model generalization ability, and improve the accuracy of answer prediction. Our results show that our mirror distillation method significantly improves the performance of the model. Moreover, our results also prove that the focal loss effectively solves the problem of data imbalance in the task.},

  abstract={This paper presents the implementation of the tabular learner model by FastAI for Parkinson’s disease (PD) identification. FastAI is one of the deep learning libraries that provide practitioners with high-level components that can quickly, efficiently, and easily. The dataset that we use is generated from the calculation of 29 acoustic parameters of the Multidimensional Voice Program (MDVP) in 3 different types of voice recording groups, namely PD voice, PD control voice, and Healthy voice. Our group of voice recordings was obtained from clinical assessments conducted by Taipei Medical University Hospital on PD patients and PD controls who were patients with suspected PD but not PD after clinical assessment. The healthy voice recording group we collected as a dataset contribution with a total of 55 healthy voice recording samples, 145 PD voice recording samples, and 55 control PD voice recording samples. Samples were recorded with vocal /a/ and vocal /u/ for 3 seconds with a recording distance of 5 cm, 16-bit quantization, and the sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. Our proposed model achieves the best results with an accuracy of 82%, root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.35 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.94 using a dataset of PD voice recordings and healthy voice recordings. It was concluded that the tabular learner model by FastAI has considerable potential for PD identification based on voice recordings.},

  abstract={Network slicing is considered a promising networking pillar of efficient resource management in beyond 5G (B5G) networks. However, the dynamic and complex characteristics of future networks pose challenges in designing novel resource allocation techniques due to the stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements and virtualized network infrastructures. To solve this issue, we propose a digital twin (DT)-enabled deep distributional Q-network (DDQN) framework that constructs a digital mirror of the physical slicing-enabled network to simulate its complex environment and predict the dynamic characteristics of the network. The DT of network slicing is expressed as a graph, and a graph neural network (GNN) is developed to learn the complicated relationships of the network slice. The graph-based network states are forwarded to the DDQN agent to learn the optimal network slicing policy. Through simulations, it is demonstrated that the proposed technique can satisfy the stringent QoS requirements and achieve near-optimal performance in a dynamic B5G network.},

  abstract={Stress has become one of the mental health adversaries of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several stressors like fear of infection, lockdown, and social distancing are commonly accountable for the stress. The existing stress prediction systems are less compatible to handle diversly changing stressors during COVID-19. The traditional approaches often use incomplete features from limited sources (e.g., only wearable sensor or user device) and static prediction techniques. The Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI) employs machine learning to make data from these sources usable for decision making. Therefore, In this study, we propose a Digital Twin of Mental Stress (DTMS) model that employs IoT-based multimodal sensing and machine learning for mental stress prediction. We obtained 98% accuracy for four widely used Machine Learning(ML) algorithms Naïve Bayes(NB), Random Forest(RF), Multilayer Perceptron(MLP), and Decision Tree (DT). The optimal Digital Twin Features (DTF) could reduce the classification time.},

  abstract={Recently, many fully supervised deep learning based methods have been proposed for automatic cardiac segmentation. However, it is very expensive and time-consuming to annotate data for the task. In this paper, we present a novel dual attention based uncertainty-aware mean teacher semi-supervised framework (DA-UAMT) for cardiac image segmentation. The framework consists of a teacher model and a student model with the same structure and the student model learns from the teacher model by minimizing a segmentation loss generated from labeled images and a consistency loss generated from unlabeled images with respect to the targets of the teacher model. To enable the student model learn from more reliable targets, we introduce the Monte Carlo Dropout which estimates target uncertainty, and a novel dual attention mechanism which helps the network to focus on information in shape and channel dimension. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments on MICCAI 2017 Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset. Experiments show that our proposed DA-UAMT model is effective in utilizing unlabeled data to obtain considerably better segmentation of cardiac.},

  abstract={Advanced services leveraged for future smart cities have played a significant role in the advancement of 5G networks towards the 6G vision. Interactive immersive applications are an example of those enabled services. Such applications allow for the interaction between multiple users in a 3D environment created by virtual presentations of real objects and participants using various technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Extended Reality (XR), Digital Twin (DT) and holography. These applications require advanced computing models which allow for the processing of massive gathered amounts of data. Motions, gestures and object modification should be captured, added to the virtual environment, and shared with all the participants. Relying only on the cloud to process this data can cause significant delays. Therefore, a hybrid cloud/edge architecturewith an intelligent resource orchestration mechanism, that is able to allocate the available capacities efficiently is necessary. In this paper, a blockchain and federated learning-enabled predicted edge-resource allocation (FLP-RA) algorithm is introduced to manage the allocation of computing resources in B5G networks. It allows for smart edge nodes to train their local data and share it with other nodes to create a global estimation of future network loads. As such, nodes are able to make accurate decisions to distribute the available resources to provide the lowest computing delay.},

  abstract={Efficient path planning is the key enabling technology for the realization of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, due to poor real-time performance and lack of effective incentive methods, it is difficult for traditional path planning schemes to significantly improve the efficiency of traffic management. In addition, existing solutions that use driving distance and driving time as indicators cannot meet the personalized requirements of vehicle users. To this end, by considering the personalized requirements of vehicle users, we propose a digital-twin (DT) enabled path planning scheme to facilitate traffic management. To be specific, based on the collection of traffic data, we first establish a DT architecture for traffic scheduling to reduce the delay of path planning. Then, according to the traffic density of different road sections, we regard road sections as resources and set different rewards for different road sections to encourage vehicles to obey the scheduling instructions. In addition, by jointly considering the driving time and rewards, we further design personalized utility models to map the requirements of different vehicle users. After that, based on the personalized requirement of the vehicle user, we use a $Q$-learning algorithm to obtain the optimal path with the target of maximizing the user's utility. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can bring higher utility to the vehicle users than the conventional schemes.},

However, it is far from practical and secure because data privacy is still vulnerable due to the well-studied attacks, e.g., membership inference attacks and model inversion attacks. In this paper, to further prevent data leakage against these attacks, we propose FL-PATE, a differentially private federated learning framework with knowledge transfer. Specifically, participants with sensitive data are grouped to train teacher models under federated learning settings, and the knowledge of teacher models is transferred to a publicly accessible student model for prediction via aggregating teacher models' outputs of public datasets. A modified client-level differential privacy mechanism is used to guarantee each participant's data privacy during the corresponding teacher model's training process. The proposed framework preserves participant's privacy against membership inference attacks and the differential privacy cost is fixed. The privacy analysis and experiments demonstrate that trained teacher and student models have an excellent performance in accuracy and robustness theoretically and empirically.},

In this work, we combine text dialogue history representations generated by a GPT-2 model with audio embeddings obtained by the recently released Wav2Vec2 transformer model. We jointly fine-tune these models to learn dialogue policies via supervised learning and two policy gradient-based reinforcement learning algorithms.

  abstract={This research focuses on designing user interface for a website that will provide people with formal and informal education a platform to post and seek jobs. The goal of the website is to reduce the dependencies and unemployment in different communities. This research paper aims to work on how to implement the Goal-Directed Design (GDD) method in designing the user interface. This paper will discuss in detail implementation of the 5 phases of the GDD method instead of the entire 6 phases in designing the user interface. Moreover, the work will also be discussing the research method used to gather the users’ desires and expectations from the product/website. The study used qualitative research methodology, and due to limited resources at hand, the researcher had access to a hand full of volunteers to conduct the field research, who were able to gather sufficient data needed to implement the GDD design method. The study commences the interface designing by identifying user objectives and behavior and translating them into the user model of the interface designed for job posting and seeking website. System Usability Scale (SUS) measurement parameters of usability testing were used to test the usability. The finding shows an average usability acceptability score of more than 77.5. Therefore, it can be concluded that the usability of the design is serving its purpose is in a good category. What this paper didn’t talk about was how the design is to be translated into codes. As in developing the actual website because the study of this paper was focused only on the designing of the user interface and delivering a prototype.},

  abstract={The development of Digital Twins (DTs) has bloomed significantly in last years and related use cases are now pervading several application domains. DTs are built upon Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT platforms and critically rely on the availability of reliable sensor data. To this aim, in this article, we propose a sensor fault detection, isolation and accommodation (SFDIA) architecture based on machine-learning methodologies. Specifically, our architecture exploits the available spatio-temporal correlation in the sensory data in order to detect, isolate and accommodate faulty data via a bank of estimators, a bank of predictors and one classifier, all implemented via multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Faulty data are detected and isolated using the classifier, while isolated sensors are accommodated using the estimators. Performance evaluation confirms the effectiveness of the proposed SFDIA architecture to detect, isolate and accommodate faulty data injected into a (real) wireless sensor network (WSN) dataset.},

  abstract={Nuclear power plants can provide a huge amount of clean energy, which can help most countries to meet their greenhouse gas emission requirements according to the Paris agreement on climate change. To meet this energy need, the nuclear plant must be operated safely and economically, which makes the digital twin concept viable for achieving this aim. The digital twin can be used to monitor plant condition, fault diagnosis, prediction, and plant maintenance support systems. In this work, the framework for digital twin in a nuclear plant is proposed. This framework combines the application of the nuclear plant simulator and machine learning tools. The machine learning aspect of this digital twin concept is the focus of this paper. Data was generated by using a personal computer-based nuclear plant simulator. Principal component analysis was used in reducing the data dimension. Artificial neural networks and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems were trained with the reduced data and used to diagnose the faults. Four faults in the plant were diagnosed with minimal error. The fault diagnosis is a significant aspect of the digital twin framework.},

  abstract={Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming ubiquitous with a proliferation of smart medical devices and applications used in smart hospitals, smart-home based care, and nursing homes. It utilizes smart medical devices and cloud computing services along with core Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to sense patients' vital body parameters, monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to support just-in-time health services. Mostly, this large amount of data is analyzed in centralized servers. Anomaly Detection (AD) in a centralized healthcare ecosystem is often plagued by significant delays in response time with high performance overhead. Moreover, there are inherent privacy issues associated with sending patients' personal health data to a centralized server, which may also introduce several security threats to the AD model, such as possibility of data poisoning. To overcome these issues with centralized AD models, here we propose a Federated Learning (FL) based AD model which utilizes edge cloudlets to run AD models locally without sharing patients' data. Since existing FL approaches perform aggregation on a single server which restricts the scope of FL, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical FL that allows aggregation at different levels enabling multi-party collaboration. We introduce a novel disease-based grouping mechanism where different AD models are grouped based on specific types of diseases. Furthermore, we develop a new Federated Time Distributed (FEDTIMEDIS) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to train the AD model. We present a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) use case to demonstrate our model, and illustrate a proof-of-concept implementation using Digital Twin (DT) and edge cloudlets.},

  abstract={Since about 2002, Industry 4.0, and Digital Twin (DT) research as we know it today, enjoyed increasing attention in academia and industry. The research on the DTs of control valves is currently not as mature as in other critical fields. It is however of utmost importance given the role control valves play in the process, nuclear, and petroleum industries. As a common and essential part of the pipeline system, valves are used to regulate fluid flow within pipelines to achieve a desired flow condition. However, the local flow characteristics within the valve domain are difficult to determine experimentally because of complex geometry and inaccessibility of the flow domain. The application of DT technology in pipelines allows real-time fluid flow data transmission both at global and local levels, and performance monitoring of the system as well as for predicting remaining useful life. Big data analytics and machine learning can be leveraged to improve valve system performance prediction as well as to improve safety. This paper describes initial work carried out on developing a control valve digital twin which incorporates tools for monitoring local flow conditions in the control valve. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to determine the internal characteristics of the fluid inside the valve, and the data are analysed and managed through the development of a DT of the valve system.},

  abstract={AI Planning (or Automated Planning) is a sub-field within AI which has been applied to several information security sub-fields, particularly vulnerability detection and incident response.

Instead, an entity within a domain is modelled, describing the relevant features of an environment, the goals, constraints, and the actions available to the entity. This paper surveys the traditional field of automated planning and explores its application to the field of information security and in particular, automating cyber incident response. Relevant AI planning techniques are then applied to implement a prototype which demonstrates the feasibility of automating incident response, focusing on False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) against smart grid as a use case. The effectiveness of this prototype is validated on a digital twin power delivery system at The University of Queensland Industry 4.0 Energy Testlab. The effectiveness of this prototype is quantitatively assessed with reference to best industry practice before discussing the strengths and weaknesses of adopting AI planning for incident response, and information security domains generally.},

Lithium-ion battery has the potential in the area and now takes the biggest share of the emerging energy storage market.

Local BMS and other control methods encountered great difficulties to identify battery charging state and health state. This paper presents a digital twin based BESS state estimation method which utilizes the data storage and computational ability of cloud platform. Therefore, all the real-time data from the scattered BESSs can be aggregated and analyzed for modelling and parameter identification. This provides a more accurate and adjustable modelling solution. The BESS components are analyzed and the corresponding failure modes are given, and the battery state and fault are inspected from the whole system not battery itself. The structure of the digital twin is developed and the operating mechanism is established. Furthermore, the battery model of a series cluster and its SOC and SOH estimation methods are proposed based on the machine learning algorithm.

The structure and scale are more complex, and the collection of system parameters is brutal. In this case, how to optimize the unit output to reduce the operation cost and maintain the safe and stable operation of the system has become an important research direction. This paper presents a method to build a virtual environment of an integrated energy system based on digital twin technology and find the optimal output strategy of the unit through a deep reinforcement learning decision model. Firstly, the real-time operation data of the integrated energy system are collected by multi-dimensional sensors to build a digital twin virtual environment. Secondly, the real-time output of the unit is simulated through the digital twin, which provides the relevant operation parameter basis for the follow-up deep reinforcement learning decision-making. Finally, the deep reinforcement learning decision model is used to find the optimal strategy for unit output, and the information is fed back to the terminal controller in real-time through the digital twin to guide the output of the integrated energy system unit. The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the unit output optimization accuracy of the integrated energy system and reduce the system operation cost.},

  abstract={As an information provision technology, non-intrusive load monitoring can extract detailed load consumption separately from the mains reading, which is conducive to promoting residential consumers to join the demand-side response. The current deep learning model has been proven to be effective in NILM, but the huge amount of trainable parameters limits its implementation in hardware systems. Therefore, the knowledge distillation method is introduced into NILM. In this article, bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) based on the spatial attention mechanism is first constructed as a teacher model to guide student model learning. Then, a small-scale student model is constructed, and the training of the model is implemented under the guidance of the teacher model. The experiments confirm that the proposed teacher model achieves better results than other methods, and the student model can also obtain results close to the teacher model, which provides a research direction for the deployment of deep learning models in hardware systems.},

  abstract={Existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate predictions. One promising technique to obtain an accurate yet lightweight pose estimator is knowledge distillation, which distills the pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model. However, existing pose distillation works rely on a heavy pre-trained estimator to perform knowledge transfer and require a complex two-stage learning procedure. In this work, we investigate a novel Online Knowledge Distillation framework by distilling Human Pose structure knowledge in a one-stage manner to guarantee the distillation efficiency, termed OKDHP. Specifically, OKDHP trains a single multi-branch network and acquires the predicted heatmaps from each, which are then assembled by a Feature Aggregation Unit (FAU) as the target heatmaps to teach each branch in reverse. Instead of simply averaging the heatmaps, FAU which consists of multiple parallel transformations with different receptive fields, leverages the multi-scale information, thus obtains target heatmaps with higher-quality. Specifically, the pixel-wise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is utilized to mini-mize the discrepancy between the target heatmaps and the predicted ones, which enables the student network to learn the implicit keypoint relationship. Besides, an unbalanced OKDHP scheme is introduced to customize the student networks with different compression rates. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by extensive experiments on two common benchmark datasets, MPII and COCO.},

  abstract={The popularity of multimodal sensors and the accessibility of the Internet have brought us a massive amount of unlabeled multimodal data. Since existing datasets and well-trained models are primarily unimodal, the modality gap between a unimodal network and unlabeled multi-modal data poses an interesting problem: how to transfer a pre-trained unimodal network to perform the same task with extra unlabeled multimodal data? In this work, we propose multimodal knowledge expansion (MKE), a knowledge distillation-based framework to effectively utilize multimodal data without requiring labels. Opposite to traditional knowledge distillation, where the student is designed to be lightweight and inferior to the teacher, we observe that a multimodal student model consistently rectifies pseudo labels and generalizes better than its teacher. Extensive experiments on four tasks and different modalities verify this finding. Furthermore, we connect the mechanism of MKE to semi-supervised learning and offer both empirical and theoretical explanations to understand the expansion capability of a multimodal student.1},

  abstract={Despite the fast progress in training specialized models for various tasks, learning a single general model that works well for many tasks is still challenging for computer vision. Here we introduce multi-task self-training (MuST), which harnesses the knowledge in independent specialized teacher models (e.g., ImageNet model on classification) to train a single general student model. Our approach has three steps. First, we train specialized teachers independently on labeled datasets. We then use the specialized teachers to label an unlabeled dataset to create a multi-task pseudo labeled dataset. Finally, the dataset, which now contains pseudo labels from teacher models trained on different datasets/tasks, is then used to train a student model with multi-task learning. We evaluate the feature representations of the student model on 6 vision tasks including image recognition (classification, detection, segmentation) and 3D geometry estimation (depth and surface normal estimation). MuST is scalable with unlabeled or partially labeled datasets and outperforms both specialized supervised models and self-supervised models when training on large scale datasets. Lastly, we show MuST can improve upon already strong checkpoints [23] trained with billions of examples. The results suggest self-training is a promising direction to aggregate labeled and unlabeled training data for learning general feature representations.},

  abstract={While deep neural networks have shown impressive performance in many tasks, they are fragile to carefully de-signed adversarial attacks. We propose a novel adversarial training-based model by Attention Guided Knowledge Distillation and Bi-directional Metric Learning (AGKD-BML). The attention knowledge is obtained from a weight-fixed model trained on a clean dataset, referred to as a teacher model, and transferred to a model that is under training on adversarial examples (AEs), referred to as a student model. In this way, the student model is able to focus on the correct region, as well as correcting the intermediate features corrupted by AEs to eventually improve the model accuracy. Moreover, to efficiently regularize the representation in feature space, we propose a bidirectional metric learning. Specifically, given a clean image, it is first attacked to its most confusing class to get the forward AE. A clean image in the most confusing class is then randomly picked and attacked back to the original class to get the backward AE. A triplet loss is then used to shorten the representation distance between original image and its AE, while enlarge that between the forward and backward AEs. We conduct extensive adversarial robustness experiments on two widely used datasets with different attacks. Our proposed AGKD-BML model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

  abstract={Recently, contrastive learning has achieved great results in self-supervised learning, where the main idea is to pull two augmentations of an image (positive pairs) closer compared to other random images (negative pairs). We argue that not all negative images are equally negative. Hence, we introduce a self-supervised learning algorithm where we use a soft similarity for the negative images rather than a binary distinction between positive and negative pairs. We iteratively distill a slowly evolving teacher model to the student model by capturing the similarity of a query image to some random images and transferring that knowledge to the student. Specifically, our method should handle unbalanced and unlabeled data better than existing contrastive learning methods, because the randomly chosen negative set might include many samples that are semantically similar to the query image. In this case, our method labels them as highly similar while standard contrastive methods label them as negatives. Our method achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art models.

  abstract={Semi-supervised approaches for crowd counting attract attention, as the fully supervised paradigm is expensive and laborious due to its request for a large number of images of dense crowd scenarios and their annotations. This paper proposes a spatial uncertainty-aware semi-supervised approach via regularized surrogate task (binary segmentation) for crowd counting problems. Different from existing semi-supervised learning-based crowd counting methods, to exploit the unlabeled data, our proposed spatial uncertainty-aware teacher-student framework focuses on high confident regions’ information while addressing the noisy supervision from the unlabeled data in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we estimate the spatial uncertainty maps from the teacher model’s surrogate task to guide the feature learning of the main task (density regression) and the surrogate task of the student model at the same time. Besides, we introduce a simple yet effective differential transformation layer to enforce the inherent spatial consistency regularization between the main task and the surrogate task in the student model, which helps the surrogate task to yield more reliable predictions and generates high-quality uncertainty maps. Thus, our model can also address the task-level perturbation problems that occur spatial inconsistency between the primary and surrogate tasks in the student model. Experimental results on four challenging crowd counting datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.

  abstract={Modern recognition systems require large amounts of supervision to achieve accuracy. Adapting to new domains requires significant data from experts, which is onerous and can become too expensive. Zero-shot learning requires an annotated set of attributes for a novel category. Annotating the full set of attributes for a novel category proves to be a tedious and expensive task in deployment. This is especially the case when the recognition domain is an expert domain. We introduce a new field-guide-inspired approach to zero-shot annotation where the learner model interactively asks for the most useful attributes that define a class. We evaluate our method on classification benchmarks with attribute annotations like CUB, SUN, and AWA2 and show that our model achieves the performance of a model with full annotations at the cost of significantly fewer number of annotations. Since the time of experts is precious, decreasing annotation cost can be very valuable for real-world deployment.},

  abstract={Recent research efforts in lifelong learning propose to grow a mixture of models to adapt to an increasing number of tasks. The proposed methodology shows promising results in overcoming catastrophic forgetting. However, the theory behind these successful models is still not well understood. In this paper, we perform the theoretical analysis for lifelong learning models by deriving the risk bounds based on the discrepancy distance between the probabilistic representation of data generated by the model and that corresponding to the target dataset. Inspired by the theoretical analysis, we introduce a new lifelong learning approach, namely the Lifelong Infinite Mixture (LIMix) model, which can automatically expand its network architectures or choose an appropriate component to adapt its parameters for learning a new task, while preserving its previously learnt information. We propose to incorporate the knowledge by means of Dirichlet processes by using a gating mechanism which computes the dependence between the knowledge learnt previously and stored in each component, and a new set of data. Besides, we train a compact Student model which can accumulate cross-domain representations over time and make quick inferences. The code is available at https://github.com/dtuzi123/Lifelong-infinite-mixture-model.},

  title={Active Learning for Lane Detection: A Knowledge Distillation Approach}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},

  pages={15132-15141},
  abstract={Lane detection is a key task for autonomous driving vehicles. Currently, lane detection relies on a huge amount of annotated images, which is a heavy burden. Active learning has been proposed to reduce annotation in many computer vision tasks, but no effort has been made for lane detection. Through experiments, we find that existing active learning methods perform poorly for lane detection, and the reasons are twofold. On one hand, most methods evaluate data uncertainties based on entropy, which is undesirable in lane detection because it encourages to select images with very few lanes or even no lane at all. On the other hand, existing methods are not aware of the noise of lane annotations, which is caused by heavy occlusion and unclear lane marks. In this paper, we build a novel knowledge distillation framework and evaluate the uncertainty of images based on the knowledge learnt by the student model. We show that the proposed uncertainty metric overcomes the above two problems. To reduce data redundancy, we explore the influence sets of image samples, and propose a new diversity metric for data selection. Finally we incorporate the uncertainty and diversity metrics, and develop a greedy algorithm for data selection. The experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art on the lane detection benchmarks. In addition, we extend this method to common 2D object detection and the results show that it is also effective.},

  abstract={Point cloud semantic segmentation has become a key task of 3D vision scene understanding. It has made great progress in recent years, but existing methods rely heavily on vast labeled data which is expensive and time-consuming. Advances in semi-supervised learning (SSL) show that a semi-supervised learning paradigm can effectively improve model performance by adding unlabeled data for joint training with labeled data. Thus, we explore a novel semi-supervised 3D point cloud semantic segmentation framework by exploiting the Mean Teacher paradigm to utilize labeled and unlabeled data. Furthermore, we design two loss functions to force the teacher model and the student model to have the same prediction. The architecture is simple but effective, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our performance can be improved consistently by using semi-supervised learning with labeled and unlabeled data.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose a class-incremental SAR target identification approach based on continuous teacher-student learning. The main challenge of class-incremental SAR target identification is catastrophic forgetting: as the learned model tend to adapt to the most recently seen new identification task, they forget what they have learned before and therefore lose performance on the tasks that were learned previously. Our method aims at introducing the teacher model, which can utilize data from tasks so far, to prevent the student model from catastrophic forgetting. For each task, the teacher model learn to capture the knowledge contained in the tasks by now. When a new task is presented, the student model is encouraged to learn from the teacher model so that the information on which the previous task relied is retained. At the same time, we also make the student model to review its own knowledge to further alleviate catastrophic forgetting. The evaluation of continuous SAR target recognition task shows that this method reduces forgetting effect.},

However, due to the high level of complexity and the huge amount of data, mobility profiling faces huge challenges. Digital Twin (DT) technology paves the way for cost-effective and performance-optimised management by digitally creating a virtual representation of the network to simulate its behaviour. In order to capture the complex spatio-temporal features in traffic scenario, we construct alignment diagrams to assist in completing the spatio-temporal correlation representation and design dilated alignment convolution network (DACN) to learn the fine-grained correlations, i.e., spatio-temporal interactions.

Through reasonable cooperative computing between nodes, service delays far lower than offloading tasks to the cloud can be obtained. We generate and maintain the simulation of cooperation between SCeNB nodes by constructing a Digital twin to simulate SCeNB nodes in the small cell manager (SCM), thereby realizing user task offloading positions, sub-channel allocation and computing resource allocation.

  abstract={As the core technology of autonomous driving, 3D object detection has attracted a great interest of lots of researchers. Many 3D object detection methods achieved promising performance. However, current 3D object detection method relies heavily on 3D annotation. The quantity and quality of annotation directly determine the performance of current 3D object detector, but 3D annotation is very expensive and require lots of human labor. Based upon the predicament described above, we proposed ST-PointRCNN: a semi-supervised 3D object detection method in autonomous driving, and achieves good results. Specifically, we apply student-teacher framework to train and improve the accuracy of the student model. We filter the predictions of teacher model and only keep high confidence predictions as pseudo labels. To expand the unlabeled data set and make the pseudo labels relatively more accurate than the predictions of student model, we design consistency losses for two-stage 3D object detection method to improve the robustness of the detector to data noise. Finally, we also conduct extensive experiments on KITTI dataset. The results show that comparing to the supervised method our method improve the average of car, pedestrian, and cyclist for easy difficulty by 8.8%, 9.4% and 7.1 % respectively when using 5% of label data.},

  pages={1798-1811},
  abstract={Typical image aesthetics assessment (IAA) is modeled for the generic aesthetics perceived by an “average” user. However, such generic aesthetics models neglect the fact that users’ aesthetic preferences vary significantly depending on their unique preferences. Therefore, it is essential to tackle the issue for personalized IAA (PIAA). Since PIAA is a typical small sample learning (SSL) problem, existing PIAA models are usually built by fine-tuning the well-established generic IAA (GIAA) models, which are regarded as prior knowledge. Nevertheless, this kind of prior knowledge based on “average aesthetics” fails to incarnate the aesthetic diversity of different people. In order to learn the shared prior knowledge when different people judge aesthetics, that is, learn how people judge image aesthetics, we propose a PIAA method based on meta-learning with bilevel gradient optimization (BLG-PIAA), which is trained using individual aesthetic data directly and generalizes to unknown users quickly. The proposed approach consists of two phases: 1) meta-training and 2) meta-testing. In meta-training, the aesthetics assessment of each user is regarded as a task, and the training set of each task is divided into two sets: 1) support set and 2) query set. Unlike traditional methods that train a GIAA model based on average aesthetics, we train an aesthetic meta-learner model by bilevel gradient updating from the support set to the query set using many users’ PIAA tasks. In meta-testing, the aesthetic meta-learner model is fine-tuned using a small amount of aesthetic data of a target user to obtain the PIAA model. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art PIAA metrics, and the learned prior model of BLG-PIAA can be quickly adapted to unseen PIAA tasks.},

  abstract={Significant progress has been made with face photo–sketch synthesis in recent years due to the development of deep convolutional neural networks, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, the performance of existing methods is still limited because of the lack of training data (photo–sketch pairs). To address this challenge, we investigate the effect of knowledge distillation (KD) on training neural networks for the face photo–sketch synthesis task and propose an effective KD model to improve the performance of synthetic images. In particular, we utilize a teacher network trained on a large amount of data in a related task to separately learn knowledge of the face photo and knowledge of the face sketch and simultaneously transfer this knowledge to two student networks designed for the face photo–sketch synthesis task. In addition to assimilating the knowledge from the teacher network, the two student networks can mutually transfer their own knowledge to further enhance their learning. To further enhance the perception quality of the synthetic image, we propose a KD+ model that combines GANs with KD. The generator can produce images with more realistic textures and less noise under the guide of knowledge. Extensive experiments and a user study demonstrate the superiority of our models over the state-of-the-art methods.},

Federated learning enables clients to collaboratively train models without sharing data. Digital twins provide virtual representation of the air-ground networks to reflect the time-varying status, which in combination with federated learning reconcile the conflict between privacy protection and data training in air-ground networks. In this paper, we consider dynamic digital twin and federated learning for air-ground networks where a drone works as the aggregator and the ground clients collaboratively train the model based on the network dynamics captured by digital twins. We design incentives for federated learning based on Stackelberg game, in which the digital twin of the drone acts as the leader to set preferences for clients, and clients as follower choose the global training rounds. Furthermore, considering the varying digital twin deviations and network dynamics, we design a dynamic incentive scheme to adaptively adjust the selection of the optimal clients and their participation level. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes can significantly improve accuracy and energy efficiency.},

  abstract={Deep learning has seen dramatic improvements in remote-sensing image scene classification. However, hard categories and hard examples widely exist in the data sets, due to the intraclass diversity and interclass similarity. In this letter, we propose a novel framework to address these issues. Specifically, our method first trains a general model to obtain the confusion matrix and select the hard categories. Then a sampling strategy is proposed to restructure the training set and an expert model is trained to focus on the hard categories. Finally, the knowledge of the expert model is distilled into the student model through a novel loss function, which encourages the student model to predict the hard label provided by manual annotation. Thus, the model can match the soft label provided by the expert model and pay more attention to the hard examples simultaneously. With this method, the student model cannot only deal with hard categories but also hard examples existing in other easy categories. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we comprehensively evaluate the method on three publicly available benchmark data sets, the obtained results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing baseline methods and achieves superior results on all three data sets.},

  abstract={Recently, along with several technological advancements in cyber-physical systems, the revolution of Industry 4.0 has brought in an emerging concept named digital twin (DT), which shows its potential to break the barrier between the physical and cyber space in smart manufacturing. However, it is still difficult to analyze and estimate the real-time structural and environmental parameters in terms of their dynamic changes in digital twinning, especially when facing detection tasks of multiple small objects from a large-scale scene with complex contexts in modern manufacturing environments. In this article, we focus on a small object detection model for DT, aiming to realize the dynamic synchronization between a physical manufacturing system and its virtual representation. Three significant elements, including equipment, product, and operator, are considered as the basic environmental parameters to represent and estimate the dynamic characteristics and real-time changes in building a generic DT system of smart manufacturing workshop. A hybrid deep neural network model, based on the integration of MobileNetv2, YOLOv4, and Openpose, is constructed to identify the real-time status from physical manufacturing environment to virtual space. A learning algorithm is then developed to realize the efficient multitype small object detection based on the feature integration and fusion from both shallow and deep layers, in order to facilitate the modeling, monitoring, and optimizing of the whole manufacturing process in the DT system. Experiments and evaluations conducted in three different use cases demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our proposed method, which can achieve a higher detection accuracy for DT in smart manufacturing.},

  abstract={The rapid proliferation of smart vehicles along with the advent of powerful applications bring stringent requirements on massive content delivery. Although vehicular edge caching can facilitate delay-bounded content transmission, constrained storage capacity and limited serving range of an individual cache server as well as highly dynamic topology of vehicular networks may degrade the efficiency of content delivery. To address the problem, in this article, we propose a social-aware vehicular edge caching mechanism that dynamically orchestrates the cache capability of roadside units (RSUs) and smart vehicles according to user preference similarity and service availability. Furthermore, catering to the complexity and variability of vehicular social characteristics, we leverage the digital twin technology to map the edge caching system into virtual space, which facilitates constructing the social relation model. Based on the social model, a new concept of vehicular cache cloud is developed to incorporate the correlation of content storing between multiple cache-enabled vehicles in diverse traffic environments. Then, we propose deep learning empowered optimal caching schemes, jointly considering the social model construction, cache cloud formation, and cache resource allocation. We evaluate the proposed schemes based on real traffic data. Numerical results demonstrate that our edge caching schemes have great advantages in optimizing caching utility.},

  abstract={We present DistillFlow, a knowledge distillation approach to learning optical flow. DistillFlow trains multiple teacher models and a student model, where challenging transformations are applied to the input of the student model to generate hallucinated occlusions as well as less confident predictions. Then, a self-supervised learning framework is constructed: confident predictions from teacher models are served as annotations to guide the student model to learn optical flow for those less confident predictions. The self-supervised learning framework enables us to effectively learn optical flow from unlabeled data, not only for non-occluded pixels, but also for occluded pixels. DistillFlow achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised learning performance on both KITTI and Sintel datasets. Our self-supervised pre-trained model also provides an excellent initialization for supervised fine-tuning, suggesting an alternate training paradigm in contrast to current supervised learning methods that highly rely on pre-training on synthetic data. At the time of writing, our fine-tuned models ranked 1st among all monocular methods on the KITTI 2015 benchmark, and outperform all published methods on the Sintel Final benchmark. More importantly, we demonstrate the generalization capability of DistillFlow in three aspects: framework generalization, correspondence generalization and cross-dataset generalization. Our code and models will be available on https://github.com/ppliuboy/DistillFlow.},

  abstract={Emerging digital twin (DT) and mobile-edge computing (MEC) are crucial for enabling the rapid development of 6G. However, the existing works ignore the edge collaboration, which can provide the system with additional performance gain. In this article, we study the problem of mobile users (MUs) intelligently offloading tasks to cooperative mobile-edge servers (MESs) with the assistance of DT. Specifically, a DT-assisted task offloading scheme (DTTOS) that consists of the selection of MESs and intelligent task offloading is proposed. Channel state information (CSI) and blockchain are employed to implement the selection of MESs. Then, we present a solution to enable MU’s task offloading that is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) in an intelligent way. After this, a mathematical optimization model aiming at decreasing power and time overhead is formulated. In view of the complexity, it is decomposed into two suboptimization models and solved by the decision tree algorithm (DTA) and double deep- $Q$ -learning (DDQN), respectively. Simulations are conducted to prove the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of data security assurance and network performance improvement.},

  pages={101-116},
  abstract={Intelligent task placement and management of tasks in large-scale fog platforms is challenging due to the highly volatile nature of modern workload applications and sensitive user requirements of low energy consumption and response time. Container orchestration platforms have emerged to alleviate this problem with prior art either using heuristics to quickly reach scheduling decisions or AI driven methods like reinforcement learning and evolutionary approaches to adapt to dynamic scenarios. The former often fail to quickly adapt in highly dynamic environments, whereas the latter have run-times that are slow enough to negatively impact response time. Therefore, there is a need for scheduling policies that are both reactive to work efficiently in volatile environments and have low scheduling overheads. To achieve this, we propose a Gradient Based Optimization Strategy using Back-propagation of gradients with respect to Input (GOBI). Further, we leverage the accuracy of predictive digital-twin models and simulation capabilities by developing a Coupled Simulation and Container Orchestration Framework (COSCO). Using this, we create a hybrid simulation driven decision approach, GOBI*, to optimize Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. Co-simulation and the back-propagation approaches allow these methods to adapt quickly in volatile environments. Experiments conducted using real-world data on fog applications using the GOBI and GOBI* methods, show a significant improvement in terms of energy consumption, response time, Service Level Objective and scheduling time by up to 15, 40, 4, and 82 percent respectively when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

However, varies types of smart vehicles with distinct capacities, diverse applications with different resource demands as well as unpredictive vehicular topology, pose significant challenges on realizing efficient edge computing services. To cope with these challenges, we incorporate digital twin technology and artificial intelligence into the design of a vehicular edge computing network. It centrally exploits potential edge service matching through evaluating cooperation gains in a mirrored edge computing system, while distributively scheduling computation task offloading and edge resource allocation in an multiagent deep reinforcement learning approach. We further propose a coordination graph driven vehicular task offloading scheme, which minimizes offloading costs through efficiently integrating service matching exploitation and intelligent offloading scheduling in both digital twin and physical networks.

  abstract={Digital twin is the innovation backbone of the smart manufacturing by delivering virtual representation of the real world. Aiming at constructing virtual representations of visual scenes, scene graph generation is a digital twin task that not only models objects but also infers their relationships. Existing works usually learn coarse global context when predicting relationships leading to excessive redundant information being considered. In this article, we first classify objects into different subgroups according to the degree of correlations with several hub objects. Then, we propose a multihub driven attention network (MHDANet) based on deep learning that drives the information to pass within the subgroups and forces objects to attend more to related objects. Consequently, MHDANet learns compact relation-aware features of visual scenes and predicts accurate and diverse relationships. Experimental results show that MHDANet achieves superb performance on scene graph generation on real-world datasets and especially alleviates the imbalance of predicted relationship categories.},

  abstract={Pepper is a humanoid robot capable of expressing body language, perceiving, and interacting with its surrounding environment, thanks to a wide set of sensors and actuators and exposing capabilities and high-level interfaces for natural interaction with humans. In this article, we present the development of VPepper, the Pepper virtual replica, by describing experiences focused on the interaction of the digital twin with the replicas of the smart objects in a smart home. Pepper robot has been featured with arms and hands, but its motors and actuators cannot support intensive experimental sessions and training procedures to learn how safely touch objects. Here, digital twin metaphor plays a crucial role. By a virtual and reliable replica of the robot, machine learning procedures can be seamlessly moved to/from the digital twin with a significant speedup and preventing the physical robot from deterioration. As a practical application, the reported case study is inspired to ambient-assisted living in elderly assistance. The experience, as well as the entire design and development process, has revealed VPepper and the smart environment to offer interesting opportunities for the physical accuracy of the simulation and for the availability of machine learning instruments that may be converted and adopted for real settings. A final empirical evaluation, performed involving 25 volunteer caregivers, confirms the perceived value and the potential usefulness of the system.},

  abstract={As a class of randomized learner model, stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) have been successfully applied in a few data analytics tasks. Given the industrial big data modeling tasks, however, the original SCNs potentially lead to excessive training time. To this end, this article extends SCNs to a hybrid parallel version, termed hybrid parallel SCNs (HPSCNs). In the hybrid parallel learning algorithm, two SCNs are synchronously constructed. The difference between the two of them is that one employs a point-incremental algorithm, and another one adopts a block-incremental algorithm. Moreover, a data parallel method is established based on a dynamic block strategy to accelerate the establishment of candidate node pool for each SCN. Additionally, this article proposes an adaptive hyperparameter adjustment method, which allows the hyperparameters in the supervisory mechanism to be automatically adjusted along with the learning process. Comparative experiments are first conducted through four large-scale benchmark datasets, followed by the fully discussion on the algorithm parameters. Finally, a practical industrial application case is made, where a grinding particle size soft sensor is developed based on HPSCN, showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  pages={630-641},
  abstract={Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging approach for collaboratively training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on mobile devices, without private user data leaving the devices. Previous works have shown that non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) user data harms the convergence speed of the FL algorithms. Furthermore, most existing work on FL measures global-model accuracy, but in many cases, such as user content-recommendation, improving individual User model Accuracy (UA) is the real objective. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Task FL (MTFL) algorithm that introduces non-federated Batch-Normalization (BN) layers into the federated DNN. MTFL benefits UA and convergence speed by allowing users to train models personalised to their own data. MTFL is compatible with popular iterative FL optimisation algorithms such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), and we show empirically that a distributed form of Adam optimisation (FedAvg-Adam) benefits convergence speed even further when used as the optimisation strategy within MTFL. Experiments using MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate that MTFL is able to significantly reduce the number of rounds required to reach a target UA, by up to $5\times$5× when using existing FL optimisation strategies, and with a further $3\times$3× improvement when using FedAvg-Adam. We compare MTFL to competing personalised FL algorithms, showing that it is able to achieve the best UA for MNIST and CIFAR10 in all considered scenarios. Finally, we evaluate MTFL with FedAvg-Adam on an edge-computing testbed, showing that its convergence and UA benefits outweigh its overhead.},

  abstract={The increasing number of products is the trend of current industry. However, the product development process is significantly limited by budget and testing risk. Recently, digital twin (DT) has emerged as a promising industrial paradigm that provides an integrated and cohesive view of the product design process. In this article, we propose a product design framework for Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, namely, DT-aided IoT platform design (DTIPD). This framework considers a large number of IoT devices performing different tasks with machine learning (ML) technologies. Each IoT device constructs a particular ML-based model that deals with its task automatically by feeding related data with labels. The challenges of large-scale network management and ground-truth shortage at the initial stage of product iteration are addressed. We propose a two-level hierarchical learning process using the real-time model status stored at DT servers (DTS), aiming to improve product quality while shortening the development lifecycle. The comprehensive experimental results for both the single-DTS and multiple-DTS scenarios demonstrate the applicability of our framework.},

  abstract={Anomaly-based machine learning-enabled intrusion detection systems (AML-IDSs) show low performance and prediction accuracy while detecting intrusions in the Internet of Things (IoT) than that of deep learning-based intrusion detection systems (DL-IDSs). In particular, AML-IDS that employ low complexity models for IoT, such as the principal component machine (PCA) method and the one-class support vector machine (1-SVM) method, are inefficient in detecting intrusions when compared to DL-IDS with the two-class neural network (2-NN) method. PCA and 1-SVM AML-IDS suffer from low detection rates compared to DL-IDS. The size of the data set and the number of features or variants in the data set may influence how well PCA and 1-SVM AML-IDS perform compared to DL-IDS. We attribute the low performance and prediction accuracy of the AML-IDS model to an imbalanced data set, a low similarity index between the training data and testing data, and the use of a single-learner model. The intrinsic limitations of the single-learner model have a direct impact on the accuracy of an intelligent IDS. Also, the dissimilarity between testing data and training data leads to an increasingly high rate of false positives (FPs) in AML-IDS than DL-IDS, which have low false alarms and high predictability. In this article, we examine the use of optimization techniques to enhance the performance of single-learner AML-IDS, such as PCA and 1-SVM AML-IDS models for building efficient, scalable, and distributed intelligent IDS for detecting intrusions in IoT. We evaluate these AML-IDS models by tuning hyperparameters and ensemble learning optimization techniques using the Microsoft Azure ML Studio (AMLS) platform and two data sets containing malicious and benign IoT and industrial IoT (IIoT) network traffic. Furthermore, we present a comparative analysis of AML-IDS models for IoT regarding their performance and predictability.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), the digital twin is emerging as one of the most promising technologies to connect physical components with digital space for better optimization of physical systems. However, the limited wireless resource and security concerns impede the deployment of the digital twin in IoT. In this article, we exploit blockchain to propose a new digital twin edge networks framework for enabling flexible and secure digital twin construction. We first develop cooperative federated learning through an access point (AP) to help resource-limited smart devices in constructing digital twin at the network edges belonging to different mobile network operators (MNOs). Then, we propose a model update chain by leveraging directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain to secure both local model updates and global model updates. In order to incentivize the APs to help in local models training for resource-limited smart devices and also encourage the APs to contribute resource in local model update verification, we design an iterative double auction-based joint cooperative federated learning and local model update verification scheme. The optimal unified time for cooperative federated learning and local model update verification is solved to maximize social welfare. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme is efficient in digital twin construction.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a novel practice of using image based condition classification and visualization system to augment operators in the task of monitoring the working condition of fused magnesium furnace. The system implements two functions: working condition detection and remote visually reconstruction of the furnace flame. For the problem of working condition detection, we combine the image features and the smelting electrical currents to train the classifier under semi-supervised learning framework. We also introduce a highly efficient cross-entropy based optimization method for training. For the visualization task, we propose a practical end-to-end solution which can visually simulate the dynamic furnace flame at remote monitoring consoles according to the visual feature of the monitoring video. Finally, we introduce the distributed structure of the monitoring system which consists of a private cloud, an edge server and remote monitoring consoles. The proposed solution can be applicable for various monitoring tasks in industry. Note to Practitioners—This paper introduces an image based solution to the practical problem of condition monitoring of fused magnesium furnace. The solution includes two parts: working condition detection and visualization. First, for the abnormal condition detection problem, most existing approaches use the process monitoring video as the condition predictor. It also assumes that the video data are fully labeled with condition category, which often is not available in practice. This paper suggests a novel approach combining the monitoring video and the smelting electrical currents under semi-supervised learning framework to the development of condition classifier. Experiments show that the detection accuracy is remarkably improved comparing to the approach using monitoring video only. Second, this paper presents a remote visualization solution which enables instant reconstruction of the furnace flame at monitoring consoles using only essential features of the flame. This technique is well suited for situation of real-time remote visual monitoring with very limited network bandwidth. Finally, the condition monitoring system adopts a distributed structure including a private cloud, an edge server and remote monitoring consoles. The presented techniques in this paper can be applicable for various monitoring tasks in industry.},

  abstract={Over the past decades, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in both military and civilian fields. In these applications, flocking motion is a fundamental but crucial operation of multi-UAV systems. Traditional flocking motion methods usually designed for a specific environment. However, the real environment is mostly unknown and stochastic, which greatly reduces the practicality of these methods. In this article, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to realize the flocking motion of multi-UAV systems. Considering that the sim-to-real problem restricts the application of DRL to the flocking motion scenario, a digital twin (DT)-enabled DRL training framework is proposed to solve this problem. The DRL model can learn from DT and be quickly deployed on the real-world UAV with the help of DT. Under this training framework, this article proposes an actor–critic DRL algorithm, named behavior-coupling deep deterministic policy gradient (BCDDPG), for the flocking motion problem, which is inspired by the flocking behavior of animals. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of BCDDPG. Simulation results show that BCDDPG achieves a higher average reward and performs better in terms of arrival rate and collision rate compared with the existing methods.},

User needs using the theory of Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) are investigated and researched, and smart air conditioners are researched and practiced on human interaction design. Firstly, in order to establish a user model, the questions and needs of the target users are explored through the questionnaire survey method. Secondly, from the perspective of ergonomics, the hardware and software interaction interface of the smart air conditioner is analyzed. Finally, the intelligent air conditioner is designed for HCI according to user needs, and the unsupervised feature value extraction of the vibration measurement signal of the outdoor unit of the household air conditioner is carried out by using the stacked autoencoder neural network. Three preliminary options for the design of remote controllers for air conditioners are proposed, and the fuzzy evaluation method is utilized to analyze and evaluate the three options. The research results show that the comprehensive evaluation results of the three preliminary options of the remote-control design are 0.78, 0.77, and 0.8 respectively. Compared with Option 1 and Option 2, Option 3 has obvious advantages. The design of Option 3 is more prominent in terms of comfort, aesthetics, and rationality. Therefore, Option 3 is selected as the final design solution. Under different hidden layer numbers and node numbers, the classification accuracy rate changes in a convex function. When the number of layers is 3 and the number of nodes is 100, the classification accuracy rate is the highest.

  abstract={Digital twin (DT) provides accurate guidance for multidimensional resource scheduling in 5G edge computing-empowered distribution grids by establishing a digital representation of the physical entities. In this article, we address the critical challenges of DT construction and DT-assisted resource scheduling such as low accuracy, large iteration delay, and security threats. We propose a federated learning-based DT framework and present a Secure and lAtency-aware dIgital twin assisted resource scheduliNg algoriThm (SAINT). SAINT achieves low-latency, accurate, and secure DT by jointly optimizing its total iteration delay and loss function, and leveraging abnormal model recognition (AMR). SAINT enables intelligent resource scheduling by using DT to improve the learning performance of deep Q-learning. SAINT supports access priority and energy consumption awareness due to the consideration of long-term constraints.

  abstract={A cyber digital twin is a bridge connecting cyber and physical space, and it also provides a paradigm for intelligent service-oriented future network architectures. This article proposes a cyber digital twin-based future network architecture to support cross-space intelligent services and manage cross-space resources to meet the demand for diversified intelligent services. The cyber digital twin is introduced as a smart communication agent in the edge network to handle all physical object communication; thus, all the physical object data is acquired by its cyber digital twin. To meet the demand for diversified intelligent services, the proposed network architecture consists of a service analytical model, cross-space resource representation and management, and an autonomous configuration model. The service analytical model realizes the intelligent matching of new service requirements to resource requirements. Furthermore, the cross-space resource representation and management mechanism is based on reinforcement learning to ensure cross-space service consistency and resource utilization efficiency. Finally, the autonomous configuration model provides a unified intelligent configuration method for a large number of complex operations with cross-space devices. This article also proposes a cross-space resource management scheme that utilizes reinforcement learning to learn the optimal resource allocation strategy. The simulation results demonstrate its excellent performance.},

  abstract={Following the fourth industrial revolution, and with the recent advances in information and communication technologies, the digital twinning concept is attracting the attention of both academia and industry worldwide. A microgrid digital twin (MGDT) refers to the digital representation of a microgrid (MG), which mirrors the behavior of its physical counterpart by using high-fidelity models and simulation platforms as well as real-time bi-directional data exchange with the real twin. With the massive deployment of sensor networks and IoT technologies in MGs, a huge volume of data is continuously generated, which contains valuable information to enhance the performance of MGs. MGDTs provide a powerful tool to manage the huge historical data and real-time data stream in an efficient and secure manner and support MGs’ operation by assisting in their design, operation management, and maintenance. In this paper, the concept of the digital twin (DT) and its key characteristics are introduced. Moreover, a workflow for establishing MGDTs is presented. The goal is to explore different applications of DTs in MGs, namely in design, control, operator training, forecasting, fault diagnosis, expansion planning, and policy-making. Besides, an up-to-date overview of studies that applied the DT concept to power systems and specifically MGs is provided. Considering the significance of situational awareness, security, and resilient operation for MGs, their potential enhancement in light of digital twinning is thoroughly analyzed and a conceptual model for resilient operation management of MGs is presented. Finally, future trends in MGDTs are discussed.},

  abstract={The computationally efficient solution of fully nonlinear microwave inverse scattering problems (ISPs) is addressed. An innovative system-by-design (SbD)-based method is proposed to enable, for the first time to the best of the authors’ knowledge, an effective, robust, and time-efficient exploitation of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to perform the global minimization of the data-mismatch cost function. According to the SbD paradigm as suitably applied to ISPs, the proposed approach is found on: 1) a smart reformulation of the ISP based on the a priori information on the imaged targets for defining a minimum dimensionality and representative set of degrees of freedom (DoFs) and 2) the artificial intelligence (AI)-driven integration of a customized global search technique with a digital twin (DT) predictor based on the Gaussian process (GP) theory. Representative numerical and experimental results are provided to assess the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed approach also in comparison with competitive state-of-the-art inversion techniques.},

  pages={500-515},
  abstract={Deep face forgery and detection is an emerging topic due to the development of GANs. Face forgery detection relies greatly on existing databases for evaluation and adequate training examples for data-hungry machine learning algorithms. However, considering the wide application of face recognition in near-infrared scenarios, there is no publicly available face forgery database that includes near-infrared modality currently. In this paper, we present an attempt at constructing a large-scale dataset for face forgery detection in the near-infrared modality and propose a new forgery detection method based on knowledge distillation named cross-modality knowledge distillation aiming to use a teacher model which is pre-trained on the visible light-based (VIS) big data to guide the student model with a small amount of near-infrared (NIR) data. The proposed near-infrared face forgery dataset, named ForgeryNIR, contains a total of over 50,000 real and fake identities. A number of perturbations are applied to help simulate real-world scenarios. All source images in ForgeryNIR are collected from CASIA NIR-VIS 2.0, and fake images are generated via multiple GAN techniques. The proposed dataset fills the gap of face forgery detection research in the near-infrared modality. A comprehensive study on six representative detection baselines is conducted to evaluate the performance of face forgery detection algorithms in the NIR domain. We further construct a hard testing set, named ForgeryNIR+, which contains forged images that have bypassed existing face forgery detection methods. The proposed datasets will be publicly available and aim to help boost further research on face forgery detection, as well as NIR face detection and recognition.},

This article proposes a system architecture using industrial Internet of Things and digital twin technologies to fulfill spatial–temporal traceability and visibility with seamless cyber-physical synchronization for finished goods logistics in the workshop. A long short-term memory network-enabled genetic indoor-tracking algorithm (GITA) is developed to locate product trolleys via a bluetooth low energy technology, with ultra-wideband applied to sample labeling in the training stage. It is enlightened by genetics to achieve self-adapting online for the long-term performance. A feature selection method based on received signal strength indicator is designed to deal with signal multipath fading and streamline the learning process. In addition, the spatial–temporal information obtained is leveraged to activate location-based services that can help promote operational efficiency. Moreover, a real-life case study is carried out in a world-leading computer manufacturer’s factory to illustrate the viability and practicality of the system and methods proposed, with hardware and software developed.

  abstract={Wind turbines are one of the primary sources of renewable energy, which leads to a sustainable and efficient energy solution. It does not release any carbon emissions to pollute our planet. The wind farms monitoring and power generation prediction is a complex problem due to the unpredictability of wind speed. Consequently, it limits the decision power of the management team to plan the energy consumption in an effective way. Our proposed model solves this challenge by utilizing a 5G-Next Generation-Radio Access Network (5G-NG-RAN) assisted cloud-based digital twins’ framework to virtually monitor wind turbines and form a predictive model to forecast wind speed and predict the generated power. The developed model is based on Microsoft Azure digital twins infrastructure as a 5-dimensional digital twins platform. The predictive modeling is based on a deep learning approach, temporal convolution network (TCN) followed by a non-parametric k-nearest neighbor (kNN) regression. Predictive modeling has two components. First, it processes the univariate time series data of wind to predict its speed. Secondly, it estimates the power generation for each quarter of the year ranges from one week to a whole month (i.e., medium-term prediction) To evaluate the framework the experiments are performed on onshore wind turbines publicly available datasets. The obtained results confirm the applicability of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the comparative analysis with the existing classical prediction models shows that our designed approach obtained better results. The model can assist the management team to monitor the wind farms remotely as well as estimate the power generation in advance.},

  abstract={Internet of Everything (IoE) applications such as haptics, human-computer interaction, and extended reality, using the sixth-generation (6G) of wireless systems have diverse requirements in terms of latency, reliability, data rate, and user-defined performance metrics. Therefore, enabling IoE applications over 6G requires a new framework that can be used to manage, operate, and optimize the 6G wireless system and its underlying IoE services. Such a new framework for 6G can be based on digital twins. Digital twins use a virtual representation of the 6G physical system along with the associated algorithms (e.g., machine learning, optimization), communication technologies (e.g., millimeter-wave and terahertz communication), computing systems (e.g., edge computing and cloud computing), as well as privacy and security-related technologists (e.g., blockchain). First, we present the key design requirements for enabling 6G through the use of a digital twin. Next, the architectural components and trends such as edge-based twins, cloud-based-twins, and edge-cloud-based twins are presented. Furthermore, we provide a comparative description of various twins. Finally, we outline and recommend guidelines for several future research directions.},

  pages={905-921},
  abstract={Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a promising paradigm that enables the employment of novel service types with lower deployment cost and faster time-to-value, but it introduces new fault management problems and challenges. In NFV environment, anomalies occurred in virtual machines (VMs) can be caused by faulty components of their hosting servers or anomaly propagation from other ones. If the performance of VMs degrades, we need to find out the root causes accurately, i.e., locate the exact faulty components, to recover the networks as soon as possible. In this paper, we first use digital twin to establish a virtual instance of the physical network to capture the real-time anomaly-fault dependency relationship. When the network environment changes, transfer learning is leveraged to utilize the learned knowledge of dependency relationship in historical periods to avoid huge time and computation cost of learning from scratch. Assisted by the learned dependency relationship, a dynamic set-covering (DSC) based root caused analysis problem is formulated and modeled with a set of parallel hidden Markov models to capture the dynamics of component states, which can best explain the sequence of anomalous VMs. We use alternating direction method of multipliers to decompose the DSC problem into a set of independent sub-problems and solve it in a distributed fashion. Since the state variables of each component in the DSC problem are coupled between any two successive time epochs, each sub-problem is solved by the Viterbi decoding and an incremental function is designed to construct the feasible solution that covers all anomalous VMs. Simulation results show the availability and superiority of the digital-twin assisted root cause analysis algorithm for NFV environment.},

  abstract={There has been much interest in deploying deep learning algorithms on low-powered devices, including smart-phones, drones, and medical sensors. However, full-scale deep neural networks are often too resource-intensive in terms of energy and storage. As a result, the bulk part of the machine learning operation is therefore often carried out on an edge server, where the data is compressed and transmitted. However, compressing data (such as images) leads to transmitting information irrelevant to the supervised task. Another popular approach is to split the deep network between the device and the server while compressing intermediate features. To date, however, such split computing strategies have barely outperformed the aforementioned naive data compression baselines due to their inefficient approaches to feature compression. This paper adopts ideas from knowledge distillation and neural image compression to compress intermediate feature representations more efficiently. Our supervised compression approach uses a teacher model and a student model with a stochastic bottleneck and learnable prior for entropy coding (Entropic Student). We compare our approach to various neural image and feature compression baselines in three vision tasks and found that it achieves better supervised rate-distortion performance while maintaining smaller end-to-end latency. We furthermore show that the learned feature representations can be tuned to serve multiple downstream tasks.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers knowledge of a teacher model to improve performance of a student model which is usually equipped with lower capacity. In the KD framework, however, it is unclear what kind of knowledge is effective and how it is transferred. This paper analyzes a KD process to explore the key factors. In a KD formulation, softmax temperature entangles three main components of student and teacher probabilities and a weight for KD, making it hard to analyze contributions of those factors separately. We disentangle those components so as to further analyze especially the temperature and improve the components respectively. Based on the analysis about temperature and uniformity of the teacher probability, we propose a method, called extractive distillation, for extracting effective knowledge from the teacher model. The extractive KD touches only teacher knowledge, thus being applicable to various KD methods. In the experiments on image classification tasks using Cifar-100 and TinyImageNet datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the other KD methods and analyze feature representation to show its effectiveness in the framework of transfer learning.},

Tasks including operation on sophisticated machines and other equipment are evident examples of this. These sophisticated machines are not necessarily physically available for everyone. However, digital alternatives of them can be. When connected with the physical world, enabling data flow in both directions and therefore implemented as digital twins, these systems allow true collaboration between people and machines independent of physical location. In this paper, digital twin implementations enabling efficient remote collaboration between two organizations are reported. These systems are not limited to research and education.

  abstract={Scene classification is an active research topic in the remote sensing community, and complex spatial layouts with various types of objects bring huge challenges to classification. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods attempt to explore the global features by gradually expanding the receptive field, while long-range contextual information is ignored. Vision transformer (ViT) can extract contextual features, but the learning ability of local information is limited, and it has a large computational complexity simultaneously. In this article, an end-to-end method is exploited by employing ViT as an excellent teacher for guiding small networks (ET-GSNet) in the remote sensing image scene classification. In the ET-GSNet, ResNet18 is selected as the student model, which integrates the superiorities of the two models via knowledge distillation (KD), and the computational complexity does not increase. In the KD process, the ViT and ResNet18 are optimized together without independent pretraining, and the learning rate of teacher model gradually decreases until zero, while the weight coefficient of the KD loss module is doubled. Based on the above procedures, dark knowledge from the teacher model can be transferred to the student model more smoothly. Experimental results on the four public remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed ET-GSNet method possesses the superior classification performance compared to some state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In addition, we evaluate the ET-GSNet on a fine-grained ship recognition dataset, and the results show that our method has good generalization for different tasks in terms of some metrics.},

  abstract={Saliency prediction models aim to mimic the human visual system’s attention process, and the research has made significant progress due to recent advancements in deep convolution neural networks. However, the high memory requirements and intensive computational demands make these approaches less suitable for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, and there is a need for an improved computational efficiency and reduced memory footprint to facilitate distributed IoT intelligence. This article proposes a pseudoknowledge distillation (PKD) training method for creating a compact real-time saliency prediction model. The proposed method can effectively transfer knowledge from computationally expensive once-for-all (OFA-595) as a single teacher model and a combination of OFA-595 and EfficientNet-B7 as a multiteacher model to an early exit evolutionary algorithm network student model by utilizing knowledge distillation and pseudolabeling. Five saliency benchmark datasets are used to demonstrate PKD’s improved prediction performance and its reduced inference time without modifying the original student model.},

  abstract={Image guided depth completion aims to generate a dense depth map from a sparse one with the guidance of a color image. Previous high-accuracy methods often rely on complex networks that are large in size and expensive in computational cost, making them inapplicable to real-time platforms. In this letter, we propose a self-paced knowledge distillation method, which obtains a lightweight but accurate depth completion model via distilling knowledge from a complex teacher network. Specifically, by taking advantage of the easy-to-hard learning curriculum in deep networks, we first design a groundtruth-free hard-pixel mining module to tell hard and noisy pixels in the teacher’s output. Then, we design two self-paced distillation losses, which gradually introduce hard pixels to distill the depth and structure knowledge from the teacher to the compact student network. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that the proposed method can improve the original student model by a considerable margin. The distilled compact and real-time student model outperforms all previous lightweight networks, mitigating the performance gap with state-of-the-art high-accuracy but complex models.},

  abstract={operating real hardware is a fundamental engineering skill. For this reason, hands-on classes involving real equipment is an essential tool in engineering education. At the same time in many cases there are certain limitations related to in-person training of students: hardware availability, hardly modifiable functionality for each student and educational goal, the increased demand on remote learning and safety aspects. Modern information technologies enable various means for partially solving the mentioned issues by providing remote access, VR-technologies, digital twins, etc. The paper provides a brief overview of aspects related to introducing virtual labs into educational process, with the main focus on the requirement for the virtual hardware, such as an electric power drive system, should replicate processes with time resolution in order of several milliseconds. And the interaction of the equipment with the student should be done in a way there is a feeling of a real object, necessitating low response time in order of hundreds of milliseconds. This requires high priority of computational power allocation for mathematical model calculation as well as high communication channel bandwidth between the computation power source and the user interface. The paper presents an example of such a server deployed virtual laboratory. The functionality was inspired by that of real equipment installed at Energy saving electric power drive laboratory at the Department of Electric Drives of Moscow Power Engineering Institute. Apart from substantively replicating the functionality and feel of high-dynamic hardware real-time operation, it enables to provide each student with an individual virtual equipment set to be explored, tuned or diagnosed. Virtual labs of the kind proved to be an effective engineering education tool for remote learning, giving new opportunities in improving the in-person training process as well.},

  abstract={A Digital Twin is a digital replica of a living or nonliving physical entity, and this emerging technology attracted extensive attention from different industries during the past decade. Although a few Digital Twin studies have been conducted in the transportation domain very recently, there is no systematic research with a holistic framework connecting various mobility entities together. In this study, a mobility digital twin (MDT) framework is developed, which is defined as an artificial intelligence (AI)-based data-driven cloud–edge–device framework for mobility services. This MDT consists of three building blocks in the physical space (namely, Human, Vehicle, and Traffic), and their associated Digital Twins in the digital space. An example cloud–edge architecture is built with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to accommodate the proposed MDT framework and to fulfill its digital functionalities of storage, modeling, learning, simulation, and prediction. A case study of the personalized adaptive cruise control (P-ACC) system is conducted, which integrates the key microservices of all three digital building blocks of the MDT framework: 1) the Human Digital Twin with user management and driver type classification; 2) the Vehicle Digital Twin with cloud-based advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS); and 3) the Traffic Digital Twin with traffic flow monitoring and variable speed limit. Future challenges of the proposed MDT framework are discussed toward the end of the article, including standardization, AI for computing, public or private cloud service, and network heterogeneity.},

  abstract={Technical textiles, in particular, nonwovens used, for example, in medical masks, have become increasingly important in our daily lives. The quality of these textiles depends on the manufacturing process parameters that cannot be easily optimized in live settings. In this article, we present a visual analytics framework that enables interactive parameter space exploration and parameter optimization in industrial production processes of nonwovens. Therefore, we survey analysis strategies used in optimizing industrial production processes of nonwovens and support them in our tool. To enable real-time interaction, we augment the digital twin with a machine learning surrogate model for rapid quality computations. In addition, we integrate mechanisms for sensitivity analysis that ensure consistent product quality under mild parameter changes. In our case study, we explore the finding of optimal parameter sets, investigate the input–output relationship between parameters, and conduct a sensitivity analysis to find settings that result in robust quality.},

  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={29646-29667},
  abstract={Privacy protection, high labeling cost, and varying characteristics of seizures among patients and at different times are the main obstacles to building seizure detection models. Considering these issues, we propose a novel Mentor-Student architecture for Patient-Specific seizure detection (MS4PS). It contains a new method of knowledge transferring called mentor-select-for-student, which exploits the knowledge of a mentor model by using this model to select data for training a student model, making it possible to avoid transferring patient data and the negative influence of transferring parameters/structures of pre-trained models. It also contains a new method of active learning, which uses both an experienced mentor model and a quick-learning student model to select high-quality samples for doctors to label. Each of the two models is coupled with a particular sample selection strategy that combines uncertainty/certainty and the distance between the unlabeled samples and labeled seizure samples. The proposed method can quickly train a suitable detector for a patient at his/her first epilepsy diagnosis with the help of: (1) an experienced mentor model that chooses the most category-certain electroencephalography (EEG) data segments; (2) a student model (detector itself) that chooses the most category-uncertain EEG data segments; (3) doctors who label these data segments selected by both the mentor model and student model. By replacing or improving the mentor model and refining the historical models of patients when they come next time, the MS4PS system can be sustainably promoted. The proposed method is tested on the CHB-MIT and NEO datasets, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract={To better support the emerging vehicular applications and multimedia services, vehicular edge computing (VEC) provides computing and caching services in proximity to vehicles, by reducing network transmission latency and alleviating network congestion. However, current VEC networks may face some implementation challenges, such as high mobility of vehicles, dynamic vehicular environment, and complex network scheduling. Digital twin, as an emerging technology, can make the virtual representation of physical networks to predict, estimate, and analyze the real-time network state. In this paper, we integrate digital twin into VEC networks to adaptively make network management and policy schedule. We first introduce the framework of VEC networks and present the key problems in a VEC network. Next, we give the concept of digital twin and propose an adaptive digital twin-enabled VEC network. In the proposed network, digital twin can enable adaptive network management via the two-closed loops between physical VEC networks and digital twins. Further, we propose a digital twin empowered VEC offloading problem with vehicle digital models and road side unit (RSU) digital models. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based offloading scheme is designed to minimize the total offloading latency. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DRL-based algorithm for VEC offloading.},

  pages={36188-36199},
  abstract={Anomaly detection is an integral part of a number of surveillance applications. However, most of the existing anomaly detection models are statically trained on pre-recorded data from a single source, thus making multiple assumptions about the surrounding environment. As a result, their usefulness is limited to controlled scenarios. In this paper, we fuse information from live streams of audio and video data to detect anomalies in the captured environment. We train a deep learning-based teacher-student network using video, image, and audio information. The pre-trained visual network in the teacher model distills its information to the image and audio networks in the student model. Features from image and audio networks are combined and compressed using principal component analysis. Thus, the teacher-student network produces an image-audio-based light-weight joint representation of the data. The data dynamics are learned in a multivariate adaptive Gaussian mixture model. Empirical results from two audio-visual datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of joint representation over single modalities in the adaptive anomaly detection framework. The proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by an average of 15.00 % and 14.52 % in AUC values for dataset 1 and dataset 2, respectively.},

  abstract={The precise control of a complex system requires a good numerical model with elegant consideration of the individual uniqueness. A data-driven online machine learning (OML) framework is proposed in this paper to achieve this goal. A set of UVLED reliability testing data is applied to verify the feasibility of the OML concept. Moreover, the design guidelines are then deduced.The OML model is built based on neural network (NN) architecture. The genetic algorithm (GA) and the principal component analysis (PCA) are applied to obtain the optimal NN initial weighting parameters. After hundreds of iterations, this model is defined as the based model of ML. Through careful investigation of the evolution of the NN parameters at each iteration, the feasibility of OML for engineering applications is validated. Moreover, the basic strategy for OML has been established, including the continuous monitoring of the weighting change and the prediction error. The result shows that only 1,000-hour data is required to predict the individual LED performance of 3,000 hours with acceptable accuracy.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Soil moisture (SM) is an important parameter used to control a broad range of environmental applications. An increasing attention has been recently given to machine learning (ML) methods for SM retrieval that provide promising performance. Nevertheless, most of them are based on a supervised learning strategies that depend on the used labeled training samples. In fact, they are unaffordable or costly. In this letter, new teacher–student for SM estimation, called (TS-SME), relying on teacher–student (TS) framework using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data, was proposed to estimate SM. The main advantage of this framework is to enroll a large amount of unlabeled data together with a small amount of labeled data. Experiments were carried out on two arid areas in southern Tunisia. The input data include the backscatter coefficient in two-mode polarization ( $\sigma ^{\circ }_{\textrm {VV}}$  and  $\sigma ^{\circ }_{\textrm {VH}}$ ) for Sentinel-1A, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference infrared index (NDII) for Sentinel-2A and in situ measurements. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that TS-SME framework is capable of generating a well-performed student model, with the estimation accuracy is superior to all teacher models [artificial neural network (ANN), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest regressor (RFR), and water cloud model (WCM)]. It was highly correlated with the in situ measurements with high Pearson’s correlation coefficient  $R$  ( ${R}_{\textrm {RF}} =0.86$ ,  ${R}_{\textrm {ANN}} =0.75$ ,  ${R}_{\textrm {XGBoost}} =0.77$ ,  ${R}_{\textrm {WCM}} =0.77$ ,  ${R}_{{\,\,\textrm {TS-SME}}} =0.96$ ) and low root mean square error (RMSE) ( $\textrm {RMSE}_{\textrm {RF}} =1.09$ %,  $\textrm {RMSE}_{\textrm {ANN}} =1.49$ %,  $\textrm {RMSE}_{\textrm {XGBoost}} =1.39$ %,  $\textrm {RMSE}_{\textrm {WCM}} =1.12$ %,  $\textrm {RMSE}_{\,\,\textrm {TS-SME{} }} =0.8$ %), respectively.},

  abstract={Digital twin and data-driven technologies provide an idea for realizing complex product quality prediction. Aiming at the issues of real-time visual monitoring, operating status analysis, and quality prediction in complex die-casting intelligent manufacturing, a digital twin and data-driven quality prediction architecture is proposed.

The collaborative working mode of physical cells, virtual cells, and real-time monitoring is constructed to predict product quality. The learning method of die-casting parameter data and appearance defect data is proposed to realize the real-time quality prediction in die-casting process and the appearance defect quality prediction after processing, respectively. The data preprocessing and XGBoost-based learning method is proposed for real-time quality prediction of die-casting process. A single-shot refinement neural network for aluminum casting tiny defects detection (Refine-ACTDD) based on deep learning is proposed to solve the high-precision defect detection problems of small appearance defects of complex castings and large interference of complex background. Taking the complex aluminum die-casting as an example, the applications of quality prediction are verified. The method provides a new technical approach for high-precision quality prediction of complex die-casting manufacturing.},

  abstract={The use of digital twins to represent a product or process digitally is trending in many engineering disciplines. This term has also been recently introduced in the medical field. In arthroscopic surgery education, the paradigm shift from apprenticeship to simulation training has driven the need for better simulators, and the current focus is on improving simulators with respect to computational efficiency and system accuracy. However, expanding surgical simulations towards digital twins has not yet been explored. This paper introduces the digital twin concept for arthroscopic surgery, and explores its potential in light of the existing scientific literature. Thus, a systematic review was conducted to summarize and analyze the literature with respect to fast and robust design of an arthroscopic digital twin using patient-specific information, and methods for interactive surgical soft tissue simulation. The review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol with three reliable scientific search engines: IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and PubMed. Eighty papers were included in the review, and the extracted data included modeling methods, tissue types, constitutive behavior, computational efficiency or accuracy, hardware configuration, haptic device description, software tools, and system architectures. Considering the review, a novel macro-level conceptual arthroscopic digital twin system is presented, and the applicability of the review findings for the identified subsystems are discussed. The proposed system integrates patient-specific images, diagnostic data, intraoperative sensor data, and surgical practice as inputs, and conceptually enables surgical skills training, preoperative planning, and a database of virtual surgeries.},

  abstract={The segmentation of arteries in invasive coronary angiography is necessary to build quantitative models and eventually improve the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Standard segmentation algorithms suffer due to the lack of fully annotated datasets and tend to return disconnected vessels. Thus, we explore a semi-supervised segmentation framework to address these issues. Specifically, we use a student model and a teacher model as the main framework with Nested U-Nets (UNet++) as their backbones. The student model learns by minimizing a segmentation loss between the output and the ground truth, and a consistency loss guided by the uncertainty information. Additionally, a special loss function based on elastic interaction is used to improve the connectivity of arterial branches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques over 42 labeled and 60 unlabeled samples and find relative improvement of 5.59% for Dice score and 69.99% for Betti number compared to a U-Net.},

To interpret the teacher model and assist the learning of the student, an explainer module is introduced to highlight the regions of an input that are important for the predictions of the teacher model. Furthermore, the joint framework is trained by a principled way derived from the information-theoretic perspective.

  abstract={Multi-organ segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image processing. This paper explores a novel privacy friendly setting to train a multi-organ segmentation model, i.e., learning directly from multiple pre-trained single-organ segmentation models. We formulate it into a special unsupervised ensemble distillation problem. To solve the problem, a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework is proposed, which leverages the soft labels predicted by pre-trained teacher models to train a student model, i.e., the multi-organ segmentation model. Considering the difference of the teachers in task speciality, the pseudo labels for each organ come from the corresponding teacher, and those of the background region are from all teachers. To deal with the problem of unmatched dimensionality between the teacher models and the student model, an output transformation method is introduced. The entire learning process requires only access to pre-trained models and a reasonable set of unsupervised target data, achieving a good balance between the privacy protection and model performance. Experimental results on a widely adopted benchmark dataset have shown the promise of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks have rapidly become the mainstream method for face recognition (FR). However, this limits the deployment of such models that contain an extremely large number of parameters to embedded and low-end devices. In this work, we present an extremely lightweight and accurate FR solution, namely PocketNet. We utilize neural architecture search to develop a new family of lightweight face-specific architectures. We additionally propose a novel training paradigm based on knowledge distillation (KD), the multi-step KD, where the knowledge is distilled from the teacher model to the student model at different stages of the training maturity. We conduct a detailed ablation study proving both, the sanity of using NAS for the specific task of FR rather than general object classification, and the benefits of our proposed multi-step KD. We present an extensive experimental evaluation and comparisons with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) compact FR models on nine different benchmarks including large-scale evaluation benchmarks such as IJB-C and MegaFace. PocketNets have consistently advanced the SOTA FR performance on nine mainstream benchmarks when considering the same level of model compactness. With 0.92M parameters, our smallest network PocketNetS-128 achieved very competitive results to recent SOTA compacted models that contain up to 4M parameters.

  abstract={Music tagging is the task of predicting multiple tags of a music excerpt, and plays an important role in modern music recommendation systems. To obtain superior performance, recent approaches of music tagging focus on developing sophisticated models or exploiting additional multi-modal information. However, none of them deal with the problem of label noise during the training process despite of its ubiquitous presence. In this paper, we propose a progressive two-stage teacher-student training framework to prevent the music tagging model from overfitting label noise. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method surpasses conventional label-noise-robust methods and exhibits scalability across different tagging models. Moreover, detailed analyses demonstrate that the two teachers in the framework gradually improve student model’s generalization performance and effectively avoid the impairment from label noise.},

  abstract={We propose RemixIT, a simple and novel self-supervised training method for speech enhancement. The proposed method is based on a continuously self-training scheme that overcomes limitations from previous studies including assumptions for the in-domain noise distribution and having access to clean target signals. Specifically, a separation teacher model is pre-trained on an out-of-domain dataset and is used to infer estimated target signals for a batch of in-domain mixtures. Next, we bootstrap the mixing process by generating artificial mixtures using permuted estimated clean and noise signals. Finally, the student model is trained using the permuted estimated sources as targets while we periodically update teacher’s weights using the latest student model. Our experiments show that RemixIT outperforms several previous state-of-the-art self-supervised methods under multiple speech enhancement tasks. Additionally, RemixIT provides a seamless alternative for semi-supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation for speech enhancement tasks, while being general enough to be applied to any separation task and paired with any separation model.},

  abstract={In this work, we present a low-cost and efficient method for training a rib and clavicle fracture detection model for chest X-ray (CXR) in a semi-supervised setting where only a small portion of training data with location annotation. Our method leverages the teacher-student model paradigm which forms a consensus prediction of unknown labels using the output under different input augmentation conditions. And most importantly, we develop a dynamic sharpening method to make the pseudo label generated by the teacher model approximate to the true label with low entropy. This dynamic sharpening method adaptively adjusts the sharpening effect according to the performance of the model during the training process, which can effectively cope with the label imbalance problem in the real world, and improve the model sensitivity. The experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art fracture detection performance, i.e., an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.9767 and a free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) score of 0.9300, significantly outperforming previous approaches by a gap of 1.00% and 3.68% respectively.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation aims to learn a small student model by leveraging knowledge from a larger teacher model. The gap between these heterogeneous models hinder their knowledge transfer and it would be more challenging when the teacher model is from another task. Previous methods view the teacher model as a perfect feature extractor and train the student model to mimic it. While we notice that the teacher model has defect in extracting features of another task samples. To improve knowledge distillation under such situation, we propose Multiple Auxiliary Subspaces (MAS). Most previous methods improve distillation performance by representation alignment, while we resort to the promotion of the teacher model which is more suitable for cross-task distillation. The MAS distills the knowledge in a mutual learning way based on an auxiliary network. Along with the training procedure, the teacher model is improved by the auxiliary network which works as a trainable part of the teacher model and learn the features distribution of target samples from the student model. And this promotion of the teacher model will benefit the student model via the following distillation procedure. We adopt the representation alignment technique, multiple auxiliary networks to further enhance the proposed method. The MAS works well with limited or sufficient labeled target data. If the source data is available, based on it the MAS can construct another auxiliary network to further improve the distillation. Experiments are conducted to validate that the MAS outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on several standard benchmarks.},

  abstract={Network modeling is an essential tool for network planning and management. It allows network administrators to explore the performance of new protocols, mechanisms, or optimal configurations without the need for testing them in real production networks. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a practical solution to produce network models that can learn and extract complex patterns from real data without making any assumptions. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based network models only work with traffic matrices, this is a very coarse and simplified representation of network traffic. Although this assumption has shown to work well in certain use-cases, it is a limiting factor because, in practice, networks operate with flows. In this paper, we present FlowDT a new DL-based solution designed to model computer networks at the fine-grained flow level. In our evaluation, we show how FlowDT can accurately predict relevant per-flow performance metrics with an error of 3.5%, FlowDT’s performance is also benchmarked against vanilla DL models as well as with Queuing Theory.},

  abstract={Accurate tumor segmentation of tumor images can assist doctors to diagnose diseases. However, achieving very high precision in tumor segmentation requires a large amount of annotated data, which is not easy for medical image data. In this paper, we present a novel double noise mean teacher self-ensembling model for semi-supervised 2D tumor segmentation. Concretely, the network is serialized by two groups of student-teacher networks. We design an auxiliary student-teacher module to learn the consistency regularity between the unlabeled image feature maps. In order to improve the robustness of the network, we add the random Gaussian noise to the student model every time the teacher model is updated. We test our model on the small cell lung tumor dataset and CVC-ClinicDB, and our model achieves the performance of nearly fully supervised segmentation. Moreover, the performance of our method outperforms the existing semi-supervised methods in four indicators.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={2405-2409},
  abstract={RGB-D semantic segmentation is attracting wide attention due to its better performance than conventional RGB methods. However, most of RGB-D semantic segmentation methods need to acquire the real depth information for segmenting RGB images effectively. Therefore, it is extremely challenging to take full advantage of RGB-D semantic segmentation methods for segmenting RGB images without the depth input. To address this challenge, a general depth removal distillation method is proposed to remove depth dependence from RGB-D semantic segmentation model by knowledge distillation, which can be employed to any CNN-based segmentation network structure. Specifically, a depth-aware convolution is adopted to construct the teacher network for getting sufficient knowledge from RGB-D images. Then according to the structure consistency between depth-aware convolution and general convolution, the teacher network is used to transfer the learned knowledge to the student network with general convolutions by sharing parameters. Next, the student network makes up for the lack of depth in manner of learning by RGB images. Meantime, a Variable Temperature Cross Entropy (VTCE) loss function is proposed to further increase the accuracy of the student model by soft target distillation. Extensive experiments on NYUv2 and SUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach.},

  abstract={Digital twin is increasingly prominent for realizing the digital and intelligent transformation of various industries as an emerging technological means to connect the physical and virtual world. While there has been a recent growth of interest in digital twin in industry, finance, and academia, most relevant studies lack a systematic analysis of the status quo, development trends, and technological competition situations for digital twin. In this article, we used bibliometrics and patent analysis to conduct comprehensive and in-depth research of digital twin by reviewing the current status of academic research and technological development, distribution of countries and institutions, and technological competition situations. We found that academic research and technological development in digital twin are currently in the early stages of rapid growth, which is radiating from applications in smart manufacturing to other scenarios such as medical and health, smart cities, energy, transportation, public emergency, and agricultural food. Artificial intelligence technology, digital twin integrated architecture and system, intelligent real-time control have gradually become the key topics of academic research and technology research and development in the field of digital twin in recent years. The digital framework, sustainable digital twin, deep learning and neural network algorithms, and full lifecycle management have the potential to become technology development trends.

  abstract={Neural end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) is superior to conventional statistical methods in many ways. However, the exposure bias problem, that arises from the mismatch between the training and inference process in autoregressive models, remains an issue. It often leads to performance degradation in face of out-of-domain test data. To address this problem, we study a novel decoding knowledge transfer strategy, and propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation (MT-KD) network for Tacotron2 TTS model. The idea is to pre-train two Tacotron2 TTS teacher models in teacher forcing and scheduled sampling modes, and transfer the pre-trained knowledge to a student model that performs free running decoding. We show that the MT-KD network provides an adequate platform for neural TTS training, where the student model learns to emulate the behaviors of the two teachers, at the same time, minimizing the mismatch between training and run-time inference. Experiments on both Chinese and English data show that MT-KD system consistently outperforms the competitive baselines in terms of naturalness, robustness and expressiveness for in-domain and out-of-domain test data. Furthermore, we show that knowledge distillation outperforms adversarial learning and data augmentation in addressing the exposure bias problem.},

  abstract={Digital twins have recently gained significant interest in simulation, optimization, and predictive maintenance of Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Recent studies discuss the possibility of using digital twins for intrusion detection in industrial systems. Accordingly, this study contributes to a digital twin-based security framework for industrial control systems, extending its capabilities for simulation of attacks and defense mechanisms. Four types of process-aware attack scenarios are implemented on a standalone open-source digital twin of an industrial filling plant: command injection, network Denial of Service (DoS), calculated measurement modification, and naive measurement modification. A stacked ensemble classifier is proposed as the real-time intrusion detection, based on the offline evaluation of eight supervised machine learning algorithms. The designed stacked model outperforms previous methods in terms of F1Score and accuracy, by combining the predictions of various algorithms, while it can detect and classify intrusions in near real-time (0.1 seconds). This study also discusses the practicality and benefits of the proposed digital twin-based security framework.},

  abstract={Most of the existing works on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications assume some deterministic or stochastic channel models, which is unrealistic for highly-dynamic vehicular channels in urban environments under the influence of high-speed vehicle motion, intermittent connectivity, and signal attenuation in urban canyon. Enabled by the concept of digital twin, the digital replica of a real-world physical system, this paper proposes a city-model-aware deep learning algorithm for dynamic channel estimation in urban vehicular environments. Specifically, the digital twin simulation allows us to accurately model radio ray reflection and attenuation in urban canyon, and the data can be supplemented and validated with empirical measurements. Our results indicates that the city-model-aware deep neural network (CMA DNN) estimator performs much better than conventional methods and has more than 32% improvement in BER when compared with generic DNN approaches that do not take the 3D city model into account. Since some geometry-based models like ray-tracing techniques used in the digital twin simulation for dynamic channel modeling could be computational expensive, we also propose a basis expansion model (BEM) approach to simplify the computation load of the overall methodology to gain a good balance between accuracy and timeliness.},

  abstract={This paper presents online simulation along with physical environments employing digital twins to develop robotic and computer vision applications, such as bin picking, by providing a virtual testing environment with real conditions for robotic systems and their surroundings. Particularly for situations such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, this approach permits the integration of knowledge and practice remotely without having the need of requiring a physical robot, increasing equity and inclusivity in the assessment, by reducing the gap between students from different institutions due to the lack of resources to buy the required robotic devices and even enabling remote connection to the classrooms. The proposed task can be performed as long as the educational center counts with basic computer equipment and internet connection. This paper presents a bin picker application based on mono and stereo vision to make the classification of cylinders of different colors and sizes and their arrangement in a base by using image processing and depth estimation algorithms. The performance of the classification was measured in terms of the error in millimeters from the difference of the desired and the obtained position. The images used for classification were taken in real life considering the environment conditions, and a digital twin of the bin picker and objects was made. The image classification and the overall instructions that the robot performed were generated on MATLAB, where the data from the real environment captured by cameras was sent. From here, the instructions were sent to URsim, which serves as the robot controller, and the final virtual simulation with the models of the base and cylinders was performed on Kuka-Sim Pro. This approach can then be utilized to implement different assessments based on personal results from simulation activities. As this assessment requires specialized knowledge regarding robotics, computer vision and classification algorithms, this methodology is intended to be applied for university students, at the level that is adequate according to the educational programs of each university.},

It is used to solve the problem of fewer students willing to participate in robot remote education. In this study, the Azure Kinect DK camera was used to collect the motion posture of the upper limbs of the human body. The Kinect camera calculates the frames of human arm joints’ motion. The control system calculates the direction of motion of each joint of the human body based on the quaternion by mapping the heterogeneous human joints with the robot joints. Make the posture of the human arm swing correspond to the posture of the robot’s movement. Thus, the robot in the laboratory can be driven remotely through Azure Kinect DK. By using the method described in this article, students use the camera’s motion capture system to remotely manipulate the robot to grab some simple objects. Through the method described in this research, students can carry out some simple operations on the robots in the laboratory from remote. So it is convenient for students to understand the basic principles of robots and achieve the purpose of better remote experimental teaching. At the same time, students can get practical application of motor servo control, ergonomics, physical simulation engine, digital twin system, etc.},

  abstract={The wide use of unmanned aerial vehicles provides a promising paradigm for improving air-ground services and applications (e.g., urban sensing, disaster relief) in air-ground integrated networks (AGINs). Digital twin (DT), which is an emerging technology that utilizes data, models, and intelligent algorithms to integrate cyber physical networks and digital virtual models, provides a real-time and dynamic simulation platform for strategy optimization and decision making in AGINs. Due to the openness and massive connectivity of AGINs, the security and reliability services in this system become an important issue. In this article, we investigate the DT envisioned secure federated aerial learning for AGINs via an aerial blockchain approach. Specifically, we propose a layered framework of DT envisioned AGINs, which comprises the construction segment, communication segment, aggregation segment, analysis segment, and operation segment. Based on this framework, we offer the applications of the proposed DT envisioned AGINs. To guarantee the security of data transmission in AGINs, we investigate the aerial blockchain-based approach for ensuring data security.

  abstract={A digital twin has recently received considerable attention in various industry domains. The digital twin replicates physical objects (e.g., people, objects, spaces, systems, and processes) in the real world into digital objects in the digital world. It also provides various simulations to solve problems in the real world or to improve situational operations. Therefore, the digital twin is a convergence of various technologies, such as advanced machine-learning algorithms, data analytics, super-resolution visualization and modeling, and simulation. Because the digital twin is a complicated technology, a step-by-step implementation that includes many technology elements should be considered to create a digital twin model. In this study, implementation layers are introduced to guide practical implementations of the digital twin. In addition, technology elements were suggested for the presented implementation layers. Because the suggested technology elements include clear technology definitions, various application domains (e.g., energy, transportation, logistics, environment, manufacturing, and smart cities) can easily utilize the introduced implementation layers and technology elements according to the intended purpose. Furthermore, this paper describes the evolution of digital twins. Digital twin technology has evolved continuously since 2002, when the digital twin concept was first introduced. In the described evolution levels, we show the future aspects of digital twin technology, according to the technological evolution direction. Therefore, the digital twin model can be efficiently created by considering the evolution direction and future aspects by using the suggested digital twin evolution levels.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Inference Enterprise Modeling (IEM) is a methodology developed to address test and evaluation limitations that insider threat detection enterprises face due to a lack of ground truth and/or missing data. IEM uses a collection of statistical, data processing, analysis, and machine learning techniques to estimate and forecast the performance of these enterprises. As part of developing the IEM method, models satisfying various detection system evaluation requirements were created. In this work, we extend IEM as a digital twin generation technique by representing modeled processes as executable UML Activity Diagrams and tracing solution processes to problem requirements using ontologies. Using the proposed framework, we can rapidly prototype a digital twin of a detection system that can also be imported and executed in systems engineering simulation software tools such as Cameo Enterprise Architecture Simulation Toolkit. Cyber security and threat detection is a continuous process that requires regular maintenance and testing throughout its lifecycle, but there often exists access issues for sensitive and private data and proprietary detection model details to perform adequate test and evaluation activities in the live production environment. To solve this issue, organizations can use a digital twin technique to create a real-time virtual counterpart of the physical system. We describe a method for creating digital twins of live and/or hypothetical insider threat detection enterprises for the purpose of performing test and evaluation activities on continuous monitoring systems that are sensitive to disruptions. In this work, we use UML Activity Diagrams to leverage the integrated simulation capabilities of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE).},

  year={2022},
  volume={71},
  number={},
  pages={1-13},
  abstract={We propose a simple yet effective approach, called joint guided learning (JGL), based on knowledge distillation for image classification. Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. The teacher model utilizes both correct and incorrect predictive labels to guide the optimization of the student model. However, the incorrect predictive labels have a negative influence on the student model. Moreover, it is not enough to rely solely on predictive labels to transfer knowledge. The student model should make full use of the features of the teacher model. To mitigate these issues, we design a JGL approach that exploits the joint guidance of features and the predictive labels. Our method involves two novel components: 1) a guided label refinery module that considers the correct predictions and ignores the incorrect predictions and 2) a channel distillation (CD) module that guides the student model to learn the attention map of each channel from feature maps in the teacher model. Experimental results show that our approach can achieve 82.18%, 66.08%, 88.36%, and 90.14% accuracy on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and Stanford Dogs, respectively. In addition, the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on four image classification datasets. Ablation studies further show the contributions of different components in our method.},

  abstract={A digital-twin (DT)-enabled Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) system for telemedical simulation is developed, systematically integrated with mixed reality (MR), 5G cloud computing, and a generative adversarial network (GAN) to achieve remote lung cancer implementation. Patient-specific data from 90 lung cancer with pulmonary embolism (PE)-positive patients, with 1372 lung cancer control groups, were gathered from Qujing and Dehong, and then transmitted and preprocessed using 5G. A novel robust auxiliary classifier GAN (rAC-GAN)-based intelligent network is employed to facilitate lung cancer with the PE prediction model. To improve the accuracy and immersion during remote surgical implementation, a real-time operating room perspective from the perception layer with a surgical navigation image is projected to the surgeon’s helmet in the application layer using the DT-based MR guide clue with 5G. The accuracies of the area under the curve (AUC) of our new intelligent IoMT system were 0.92 and 0.93. Furthermore, the pathogenic features learned from our rAC-GAN model are highly consistent with the statistical epidemiological results. The proposed intelligent IoMT system generates significant performance improvement to process substantial clinical data at cloud centers and shows a novel framework for remote medical data transfer and deep learning analytics for DT-based surgical implementation.},

  abstract={Recently the machine learning-enabled modeling technology has become a powerful tool to develop data-driven models for explaining, predicting, and describing system behaviors. In particular, it has become a key tool for developing data-driven models for emerging digital twin development which demands the living models for simulating system behaviors. However, such data-driven models carry a fatal deficiency: once the operational environments changed, the model may hardly work well or even becomes useless. This paper attempts to address this issue by proposing to apply transfer learning techniques to develop lifetime robust models for real-world applications. After laying out problems and the reasons of model performance degradation, this paper presents a framework for developing lifetime predictive models for digital twin.

  abstract={Realizing Service Function Chaining with a micro-service-based architecture results in an increased number of computationally cheap Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Pinning cheap VNFs to dedicated CPU cores can waste resources since not every VNF fully utilizes its core. Thus, cheap VNFs should share CPU cores to improve resource utilization. However, sharing cores can result in degraded performance due to interference between VNFs, even in mildly loaded scenarios. We propose D2A, a system that combines Neural Combinatorial Optimization, Machine Learning (ML)-based Digital Twins (DTs), and Game Theory to optimize VNF assignments. Measurements in a testbed show that D2A increases throughput by up to 46% and reduces latency by up to 93%, compared to three baseline algorithms. Using an ML-based DT to model VNF interference increases throughput by up to 11%, and reduces latency by up to 90% compared to an analytical model of the system.},

  year={2022},
  volume={60},
  number={},
  pages={1-12},
  abstract={Remote sensing data distribution generally exposes the long-tailed characteristic. This will limit the object recognition performance of existing deep models when they are trained with such unbalanced data. In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical distillation framework (HDF) to address the long-tailed object recognition in aerial images. First, we notice that not only student model should learn feature representations from teachers but also teacher models should learn feature representations from each other. Therefore, we build hierarchical teacher-wise distillation (HTWD) to improve the feature representations of the teacher models trained with middle and tail data, which is achieved by distilling the feature representations of the teacher model trained with head data. Second, we notice that the feature representations of the middle and tail classes cannot be effectively distilled from the teacher to the student since too little middle and tail data can be used to learn. Thus, we propose self-calibrated sampling (SCS) learning that enforces the student to strengthen the learning of the middle and tail data, thereby improving the student’ feature learning ability. Extensive experiments on two widely used DOTA and FGSC-23 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art methods.

In order to support massive intelligent services under the converged network in the shipyard, the mechanism for access control and QoS (Quality of Services) management need further researches. In this paper, the 5G converged shipbuilding network based on digital twin is studied, and an efficient and reliable method for multi-mode terminal access and multi-QoS management is proposed. This method continuously constructs the communication environment of digital-twin network through data collection from the physical network, and performs detailed network simulation and mapping through RL (Reinforcement Learning) in digital-twin network to achieve scheduling optimization. The decisions made in digital-twin network are delivered to the physical network to achieve efficient and reliable multi-mode terminal access and multi-QoS management. The simulation results show that the proposed new architecture and method effectively can improve the efficiency of 5G converged network in the shipyard.},

  abstract={Over the past decades industrial communication networks have evolved into highly diverse and heterogeneous environments, with a variety of different technologies being deployed to address the diverse requirements of manufacturing-and automation-specific use cases. These include stringent latency limits, high availability and reliability, as well as deterministic communication behavior. To assure the necessary allocation of re-sources and provisioning of required Quality-of-Service in highly diverse communication systems, a holistic network management approach is needed that can serve all cornerstones of modern industrial networks. More recently, this lead to the development of new adaptive and agile management approaches that imple-ment autonomous and self-organizing manufacturing networks, whereby Machine Learning (ML) methods started to become an integral part for overcoming the limiting factors of practically deploying such systems. Due to the growing complexity of today's networking environments, defining network management policies based on expert knowledge becomes increasingly difficult. ML has evolved as a promising technique to extract knowledge from collected data to enable cognitive network management approaches. This paper reviews past advances in ML applications for zero touch management of heterogeneous industrial communication networks. It illustrates how a network's management life-cycle that is based on digital twin technology can harnesses the potentials of ML to bring the concepts of organic computing and zero-touch cognitive manufacturing within industrial networks closer to reality. Lastly, recent papers that discuss the use of ML approaches for self-x features in Zero-Touch Management (ZTM) network environments are surveyed and relevant open issues are discussed.},

  pages={7269-7283},
  abstract={Images captured in clinic such as MRI scans are usually in 3D formats with high spatial resolutions. Existing learning-based models for medical image registration consume large GPU memories and long inference time, which is difficult to be deployed in resource-limited diagnosis scenarios. To address this problem, instead of shrinking the model size as in previous works, we turn to reducing the input resolution of existing registration models and boosting their performance through knowledge distillation. Specifically, we propose a cross-resolution distillation (CRD) scheme, which is designed to train low-resolution models under the guidance of corresponding high-resolution models. Nevertheless, due to the resolution gap between features in high/low-resolution models, straightforward distillation is difficult to apply. To overcome this challenge, we first introduce a feature-shifted teacher (FST) to shift and fuse features of high/low-resolution models. Then, we exploit this teacher model to guide the learning of the low-resolution student model with distillation losses on both features and deformation fields. Finally, we only need to use the distilled student model during inference. Experimental results on four 3D medical image datasets demonstrate that the low-resolution models trained through our CRD scheme use fewer than 20% GPU memories and less than 20% inference time while achieving competitive performance compared with corresponding high-resolution models.},

  abstract={Digital twinning approaches for high-value propulsion system assets is a growing trend, currently seen in renewables, marine and aviation markets. The benefits of this approach, involving "living-learning" models for diagnostic, prognostic and system optimizations are suggested in literature as many. When deploying such an approach, there are many discussions and decisions around modelling techniques to deploy, and the required fidelity of such models. It can be assumed though that the greater the potential to gain real measurement data, the greater the opportunity to improve the overall system model accuracy.This paper develops a model of a previously overlooked but essential part of the engine control system - the measuring chain relating to the closed-loop engine combustion controller. This part of the system performs an essential role to provide real-time data for the engine control loop, to be able to optimize the engine performance on a cylinder-by-cylinder, cycle-by-cycle basis. However, failure of this part of the system can often be impossible to distinguish from an engine fault when there is no knowledge of the system health of the measuring chain. Therefore, performance monitoring of this sub-system is of high value to the end-user, to fully optimize and potentially decarbonize their engine system, in combination with digital twin methods.},

To help inform researchers in this area, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review of 11 years of research (2010-2021) in student modeling, focusing on learner characteristics, learning indicators, and foundational aspects of dissimilar models. We mainly emphasize increased prediction accuracy when using multidimensional learner data to create multimodal models in real-world adaptive instructional systems. In addition, we discuss challenges inherent in real-world multimodal modeling, such as uncontrolled data collection environments leading to noisy data and data sync issues. Finally, we reinforce our findings and conclusions through an industry case study of an adaptive instructional system. In our study, we verify that adding multiple data modalities increases our model prediction accuracy from 53.3% to 69%. At the same time, the challenges encountered with our real-world case study, including uncontrolled data collection environment with inevitably noisy data, calls for synchronization and noise control strategies for data quality and usability.},

  abstract={Industry 4.0 is concerned with how the global production and supply network operates through the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing systems which depends on closed-loop control system components. These components are prone to faults, especially in sensors. so, a fault-tolerant control framework is needed to deal with these kinds of faults. Many researchers work on developing more intelligence data driven fault-tolerant control techniques instead of traditional ones which need a complete sophisticated model. This paper proposes a learning fault tolerant control of discrete event systems subjected to sensors faults, based on recurrent neural networks. The proposed network has both previous and current sensors signals as inputs and current actuators signals as outputs. The new data driven fault tolerant control replaces the diagnosis and control reconfiguration block function in the traditional one. A case study that integrates automated pneumatic material handling is used to demonstrate the proposed approach. Factory I/O simulator is integrated with MATLAB based on the digital twin concept to simulate and verify the proposed approach. Results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of handling sensors faults in faultless and various faulty scenarios.},

  abstract={The success of pre-trained language representation models such as BERT benefits from their “overparameterized” nature, resulting in training time consuming, high computational complexity and superior requirement of devices. Among the variety of model compression and acceleration techniques, Knowledge Distillation(KD) has attracted extensive attention for compressing pre-trained language models. However, the major two challenges for KD are: (i)Transfer more knowledge from the teacher model to student model without scarifying accuracy while accelerating. (ii)Higher training speed of the lightweight model is accompanied by the risk of overfitting due to the noise influence. To address these problems, we propose a novel model based on knowledge distillation, called Theseus-BERT Guided Distill CNN(TBG-disCNN). BERT-of-Theseus [1] is employed as the teacher model and CNN as the student model. Aiming at the inherent noise problem, we propose coordinated CNN-BiLSTM as a parameter-sharing layer for Multi-Task Learning (MTL), in order to capture both regional and long-term dependence information. Our approach has approximately good performance as BERT-base and teacher model with $12 \times$ and $281 \times$ speedup of inference and $19.58 \times$ and $8.94 \times$ fewer parameters usage, respectively.},

In particular, EduTalk enables the students to write VPython programs that render 3-D animations in the browser without installing extra software or using any specific (and typically expensive) hardware. EduTalk takes the user’s smartphone as a controller for cyber–physical interaction, which nicely integrates with learning of other core courses such as physics and mathematics. EduTalk allows building science exhibition projects by writing VPython programs to show 3-D animation, where the cost for EduTalk’s cyber–physical interaction is low and is almost maintenance free. The major contribution of this article is the IoT-based EduTalk proposal that subtly utilizes an IoT platform IoTtalk to conveniently generate cyber–physical interaction for learning how to program as well as learning core courses such as physics. The programming exercises can be easily extended to science exhibition projects and then the development of digital twin applications. A mechanism is provided to easily integrate GlowScript animation demos with EduTalk, which significantly simplifies the effort for teachers to prepare the lecturers. Finally, we show how data collected from EduTalk can be analyzed to improve learning design for cyber–physical interactive animation.},

  abstract={The proliferation of emergent network applications (e.g., telesurgery, metaverse) is increasing the difficulty of managing modern communication networks. These applications entail stringent network requirements (e.g., ultra-low deterministic latency), which hinders network operators in managing their resources efficiently. In this article, we introduce the network digital twin (NDT), a renovated concept of classical network modeling tools whose goal is to build accurate data-driven network models that can operate in real time. We describe the general architecture of the NDT and argue that modern machine learning (ML) technologies enable building some of its core components. Then we present a case study that leverages an ML-based NDT for network performance evaluation and apply it to routing optimization in a QoS-aware use case. Lastly, we describe some key open challenges and research opportunities yet to be explored to achieve effective deployment of NDTs in real-world networks.},

  abstract={Considering the user mobility and unpredictable mobile edge computing (MEC) environments, this paper studies the intelligent task offloading problem in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled MEC with the assistance of digital twin (DT). We aim at minimizing the energy consumption of the entire MEC system by jointly optimizing mobile terminal users (MTUs) association, UAV trajectory, transmission power distribution and computation capacity allocation while respecting the constraints of mission maximum processing delays. Specifically, double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm stemming from deep reinforcement learning is first proposed to effectively solve the problem of MTUs association and UAV trajectory. Then, the closed-form expression is employed to handle the problem of transmission power distribution and the computation capacity allocation problem is further addressed via an iterative algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme is able to converge and significantly reduce the total energy consumption of the MEC system compared to the benchmark schemes.},

  pages={7415-7422},
  abstract={Robust detection of moving vehicles is a critical task for any autonomously operating outdoor robot or self-driving vehicle. Most modern approaches for solving this task rely on training image-based detectors using large-scale vehicle detection datasets such as nuScenes or the Waymo Open Dataset. Providing manual annotations is an expensive and laborious exercise that does not scale well in practice. To tackle this problem, we propose a self-supervised approach that leverages audio-visual cues to detect moving vehicles in videos. Our approach employs contrastive learning for localizing vehicles in images from corresponding pairs of images and recorded audio. In extensive experiments carried out with a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our approach provides accurate detections of moving vehicles and does not require manual annotations. We furthermore show that our model can be used as a teacher to supervise an audio-only detection model. This student model is invariant to illumination changes and thus effectively bridges the domain gap inherent to models leveraging exclusively vision as the predominant modality.},

  abstract={This paper studies a 6G use case for connecting users in emergency. A fast-forming network with a resource-limited aerial base station (BS) connecting with scattered communities of users is considered. Properly connecting each individual user in the service area is achieved by 1) applying device-to-device (D2D) communication within each community, 2) fairly assigning limited number of channels, and 3) optimally placing the flying BS. Q-learning, a common type of reinforcement learning (RL), is employed for autonomous BS placement. Two optimization objectives for BS placement are considered to maximize the per-user data rate in the worse condition and minimize the total BS transmitted power, respectively. To overcome resource limitations of the aerial BS, the RL training with many iterations is a done in the digital twin (DT) virtual space connected to the physical space via an aerial BS enabled by 6G technology. It is shown that, even the models used in DT is imperfect, nearly-optimal results can be obtained in DT. In particular, compared to RL training 100% in the physical space, a huge number of BS moves can be avoided and significant among of time and energy can be saved.},

  abstract={Employing federated learning (FL) in multi-tier computing to achieve various intelligent services is widely in demand. However, adaptive decision-making of FL tasks to improve latency performance is still mostly limited to theoretical studies of local computational optimality, and is challenging to carry out in practical systems. This paper proposes an adaptive decision-making framework (ADMF) for FL tasks with multilayer computational participation to attain lower latency with a global optimization perspective. In this demo, a prototype framework of ADMF in multi-tier computing is demonstrated. First, the feasibility of implementing the proposed framework is provided. Then, we show the latency performance through the experimental results that validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1856-1868},
  abstract={Transfer learning is a popular software reuse technique in the deep learning community that enables developers to build custom mod-els (students) based on sophisticated pretrained models (teachers). However, like vulnerability inheritance in traditional software reuse, some defects in the teacher model may also be inherited by students, such as well-known adversarial vulnerabilities and backdoors. Re-ducing such defects is challenging since the student is unaware of how the teacher is trained and/or attacked. In this paper, we propose ReMoS, a relevant model slicing technique to reduce defect inheri-tance during transfer learning while retaining useful knowledge from the teacher model. Specifically, ReMoS computes a model slice (a subset of model weights) that is relevant to the student task based on the neuron coverage information obtained by profiling the teacher model on the student task. Only the relevant slice is used to fine-tune the student model, while the irrelevant weights are retrained from scratch to minimize the risk of inheriting defects. Our experi-ments on seven DNN defects, four DNN models, and eight datasets demonstrate that ReMoS can reduce inherited defects effectively (by 63% to 86% for CV tasks and by 40% to 61 % for NLP tasks) and efficiently with minimal sacrifice of accuracy (3% on average).},

  year={2022},
  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={67247-67261},
  abstract={In this study, a Concept Question Answering system applied to the Computer Domain (CQACD) for intelligent tutoring is proposed. This system is a dialogue-based Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that allows the tutor and student with mixed-initiative and natural language to ask each other questions concerning the basic computer knowledge in the Computer Basics course. CQACD is based on constructivist principles and encourages the learner to construct knowledge rather than merely receiving knowledge, which has the following characteristics: (a) this system employs a domain ontology with rich semantic relationships to model the basic computer knowledge and build up a concept-centric knowledge model, (b) uses a limited number of 80 input templates with description logics to acquire the intention of questions posed by students, (c) a textual entailment algorithm with semantic technologies is proposed to match the input template and assess the student’s contribution to improve the flexibility of the system, and (d) an ontology-driven dialogue management mechanism is proposed, which can quickly form the conversational content and conversational sequence. The experimental results show that CQACD can replace the teachers’ tutoring in large classes and can promote the learning of poor students in large classes better than teachers can. The paper reveals that the domain ontology with rich semantic relationships plays an important role in the Concept Question Answer System (CQAS). It can model CQAS’s discipline knowledge, provide structured domain knowledge for student model, template design and matching, and provide basic architectural architecture for dialogue management.},

  pages={421-433},
  abstract={Peer assessment is a valuable educational activity, which promotes learner engagement and critical thinking, while also decreasing the time spent by the teachers on evaluating students’ work. Over the past decades, several platforms have been proposed to support the peer assessment process. The current landscape is dominated by special-purpose, context-specific peer evaluation systems, which were designed to support a particular type of learning activity, artifact, or discipline. In this article, we propose an alternative, a generic and comprehensive peer assessment platform, called LearnEval, which is very flexible and able to accommodate a variety of pedagogical scenarios. Distinctive functionalities include: highly configurable peer assessment workflow, several automatic and manual review allocation mechanisms, initial calibration/training options for the students, complex dashboard with statistics, scores and graphical visualizations, as well as an extensive open learner model. The platform was developed in an iterative manner, with several extensions and improvements informed by the findings of the initial pilot studies. The article also reports on a practical application of LearnEval in a project-based learning scenario, with very promising results; multiple perspectives of the peer assessment process are analyzed: student behavior, peer grades validity, and perceived learning experience. Comparative results with an earlier study show increased levels of system usability, grading validity, and student satisfaction.},

  year={2022},

  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={The reliability calculation is an important step in the system analysis to determine the remaining service life of the industrial automation system’s components operating in changing environments. In contrast to classic automation systems working without considering dynamic environment parameters, for an accurate calculation, it is not adequate to use only the information obtained from product specifications or experiments. Rather, this calculation should be done dynamically. For this reason, we used the Markov model as the reliability calculation method, since it is a powerful state-based analytical technique considering the dynamic aspects concerning testing and maintenance. This is the need to add dynamism to the system. This paper proposes a novel approach using the concept of intelligent Digital Twin (iDT) for the dynamic calculation of the reliability of industrial automation systems. Moreover, we evaluate our concept as a prototype. Our developed concept is a comprehensive approximation of the calculation of reliability in an industrial automation system by considering dynamic influencing factor failure rate, human factor failure rate, manufacturer failure rate, and repair rate.},

  abstract={This article evaluates several machine learning methods to substitute the missing light detection and ranging data for better spatial localization of industrial automated guided vehicles. Decision trees and ensemble of trees using bagging or boosting techniques have been considered. Also, the  $k$ -nearest neighbors algorithm was analyzed. Most of the algorithms have been evaluated based on multiple criteria and hyper parameter tuning. The analysis of the results was done in a comparative way, multiple regression evaluation metrics being considered. The experiments have shown that the extreme gradient boosting algorithm provides the best results in terms of performance, but with timing and resource allocation drawbacks. On the other hand, a simple decision tree model seems to give good results if a tradeoff between performance and prediction time must be made. The  $k$ -nearest neighbors algorithm is also performing pretty well, especially because we are experimenting in a static environment.},

  abstract={This study introduces a Digital Twin (DT) of an air-to-water heat pump to be used in the maintenance training of secondary and Higher Education (HE) students as well as personnel and customers of companies that sell and maintain heat pumps. The DT presented introduces the learner to two key maintenance procedures in a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. The learning is based on the progress of completing the sub-tasks in an intended order. The implementation of the solution is described. A preliminary user study confirms that a DT of a heat pump is an attractive option as a VR learning environment for training maintenance procedures and tasks due to the positive learning and user experience. However, a few participants would prefer using a real system in the learning of maintenance tasks as compared to the DT. The ratings of perceived immersiveness measured as the concentration on the tasks, rather than on using the system indicate that there is room for improvement. Realism and immersiveness of carrying out tasks and actions in VR could be improved by implementing more realistic haptics as well as more freedom to carry out the maintenance procedures in a user selected order after first learning the correct order.},

  abstract={This brief proposed a Multi-Channel Multi-Domain (MCMD) based knowledge distillation algorithm for sleep staging using single-channel EEG. Both knowledge from different domains and different channels are learnt in the proposed algorithm, simultaneously. A multi-channel pre-training and single-channel fine-tuning scheme is used in the proposed work. The knowledge from different channels in the source domain is transferred to the single-channel model in the target domain. A pre-trained teacher-student model scheme is used to distill knowledge from the multi-channel teacher model to the single-channel student model combining with output transfer and intermediate feature transfer in the target domain. The proposed algorithm achieves a state-of-the-art single-channel sleep staging accuracy of 86.5%, with only 0.6% deterioration from the state-of-the-art multi-channel model. There is an improvement of 2% compared to the baseline model. The experimental results show that knowledge from multiple domains (different datasets) and multiple channels (e.g., EMG, EOG) could be transferred to single-channel sleep staging.},

  abstract={Existing skeleton-based action recognition methods require heavy computational resources for accurate predictions. One promising technique to obtain an accurate yet lightweight action recognition network is knowledge distillation (KD), which distills the knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model. However, existing distillation works in action recognition require a pre-trained teacher network and a two-stage learning procedure. In this work, we propose a novel Online Knowledge Distillation framework by distilling Action Recognition structure knowledge in a one-stage manner to improve the distillation efficiency, termed OKDAR. Specifically, OKDAR learns a single multi-branch network and acquires the predictions from each one, which is then assembled by a feature mix model as the implicit teacher network to teach each student in reverse. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by extensive experiments on two common benchmarks, i.e., NTU-RGB+D 60 and NTU-RGB+D 120.},

  abstract={The article presents the design and expected results from the use of a digital twin monitoring and management system. It is a continuation of the multi-step improvement of the sensor assembly line until its full automation. Statistical control, machine learning, deep machine learning, fuzzy logic and neural networks have been applied to improve and optimize data selection and analysis. A model of digital twins is applied, in which the analysis and feedback for automatic optimal control are outside the work center of a server or cloud. With this powerful management model, many work centers are serviced. Thus, with the development of a single powerful analysis software from the machine manufacturer, many work centers can be managed. This makes the process more automatic and with a lower cost. A specific goal has been set to speed up the work of the automatic production center for assembling sensors and achieve a production cycle of 5 seconds with improved quality results. This is achieved by optimizing automatic visual control using digital twin analysis. Quality improvement has been achieved by improving the inputs of the assembly process using digital twin analysis.},

  abstract={The increasing demand for high-quality yet low-cost electrical machines for electric and hybrid electric vehicles requires optimizing manufacturing processes across all machine elements. The needle winding technology offers the potential to meet these requirements for the production of essential components: copper windings. Thereby, the understanding of wire behavior plays a key role. In particular geometric wire bending behavior significantly influences the planning and execution of winding trajectories. Thus, building on previous work, this paper takes further steps toward a data-driven empirical approach to modeling geometric wire bending behavior. The overarching goal is to provide an efficient and comprehensive model of wire bending geometry as a function of wire tensile force and wire exit angles at the needle outlet. Spline models generated with the help of a purpose-built test bench with a dedicated image processing pipeline serve as the basis for a simplified modeling approach. The proposed model is based on circular arcs with tangential linear functions, allowing the wire bending geometry to be defined with only three parameters. Qualitative analyses of the resulting model behavior and quantitative investigations of the model errors show accurate approximation results and confirm the suitability of the developed method.},

  abstract={On the one hand, laparoscopic surgery as medical state-of-the-art method is minimal invasive, and thus less stressful for patients.

Medical Digital Twins provide an integrated and virtual representation of patients' and organs' data, and thus a generic concept to make complex information accessible by surgeons. In this way, minimal invasive surgery could be improved significantly, but requires also a much more complex software system to achieve the various resulting requirements. The biggest challenges for these systems are the safe and precise mapping of the digital twin to reality, i.e. dealing with deformations, movement and distortions, as well as balance out the competing requirement for intuitive and immersive user access and security. The case study ARAILIS is presented as a proof in concept for such a system and provides a starting point for further research. Based on the insights delivered by this prototype, a vision for future Medical Digital Twins in surgery is derived and discussed.},

  abstract={Cultural Heritage Buildings need to be preserved through interventions and actions that ensure accessibility and availability to present and future generations. The diffusion o f new technologies, including low-cost sensors and devices, has introduced many possibilities and strategies to monitor environments, including Historical and Cultural value buildings. Based on the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, modern devices and sensors can collect and manage helpful information to build a Digital Twin of the surrounding environment. In this scenario, reproducing a Digital Twin of Cultural Heritage Buildings could be crucial to monitoring, managing, and performing action aiming to protect them. One of the challenges in recent years is the automatic analysis of collected information. This paper introduces a novel approach to protecting Buildings using Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM), which leverages a sensor network and Deep Learning techniques to analyze sensor data. A case study related to the Archeological Park of Pompeii will be presented, where real-time collected data is managed and shared via a web-cloud-IoT platform. Then, collected data are analyzed through a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to prevent future issues related to Cultural Heritage Buildings, particularly humidity inside structures, which is crucial for ancient building preservation.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a promising technology to create digital replicas of physical vehicles to facilitate driving in Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, due to the uneven distribution of vehicles in the networks and the dynamics of heterogeneous wireless links, how to optimize the connection along the vehicle's trip between the vehicle and its DT to achieve the lowest cost (i.e., delay and energy consumption) is a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we investigate the joint network selection and power level allocation problem in the data synchronization issue between vehicles and DTs in the heterogeneous access networks. In order to better use the information shared by DT to facilitate the data synchronization process, we propose a learning-based heterogeneous network selection scheme in DT empowered IoV. First, we consider the data divided into blocks and model the data synchronization problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to minimize the long-term cost in terms of the delay and energy consumption. Based on the information obtained from the digital twin communications, we develop an actor-critic learning approach to solve the MDP problem with the block-level state method, and obtain the optimal network selection strategy for the vehicles. In addition, we explore the capability of digital twins by applying transfer learning. The vehicles are divided into two types, i.e., learner vehicles and expert vehicles, so that the knowledge can be transferred from the expert vehicles to the learner vehicles to effectively improve the learning efficiency and decrease the data synchronization latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme can effectively find the optimal network selection policy and achieve the fast convergence and better performance compared with existing related approaches.},

  year={2022},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a widely used technique for model compression and knowledge transfer. We find that the standard KD method performs the knowledge alignment on an individual sample indirectly via class prototypes and neglects the structural knowledge between different samples, namely, knowledge correlation. Although recent contrastive learning-based distillation methods can be decomposed into knowledge alignment and correlation, their correlation objectives undesirably push apart representations of samples from the same class, leading to inferior distillation results. To improve the distillation performance, in this work, we propose a novel knowledge correlation objective and introduce the dual-level knowledge distillation (DLKD), which explicitly combines knowledge alignment and correlation together instead of using one single contrastive objective. We show that both knowledge alignment and correlation are necessary to improve the distillation performance. In particular, knowledge correlation can serve as an effective regularization to learn generalized representations. The proposed DLKD is task-agnostic and model-agnostic, and enables effective knowledge transfer from supervised or self-supervised pretrained teachers to students. Experiments show that DLKD outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on a large number of experimental settings including: 1) pretraining strategies; 2) network architectures; 3) datasets; and 4) tasks.},

  abstract={In order for autonomously navigating Unmanned Air Vehicles(UAVs) to be implemented in day-to-day life, proof of safe operation will be necessary for all realistic navigation scenarios. For Deep Learning powered navigation protocols, this requirement is challenging to fulfil as the performance of a network is impacted by how much the test case deviates from data that the network was trained on. Though networks can generalise to manage multiple scenarios in the same task, they require additional data representing those cases which can be costly to gather. In this work, a solution to this data acquisition problem is suggested by way of the implementation of a visually realistic, yet artificial, simulated dataset. A method is presented for the creation of a “Digital Twin Area” inside of a modern high fidelity game engine using 3D scanned models of physical locations, and a realistic dataset of each area is created to showcase this concept.},

  abstract={Color restoration of endoscopic images is an urgent clinical need during photodynamic surgery. In recent years, deep learning methods achieved notable results in the fields of image processing. The model compression algorithm and hardware performance enhancement improved the model inference speed. It is possible to apply deep learning methods to the task of endoscopic image color restoration during surgery. However, experiments show that model compression can lead to image deterioration. To solve this issue, we propose a fast color restoration method for endoscopic images, which use multiscale discriminator based on model compression. Initially, we train a CycleGAN teacher network with multiscale discriminator. Then, we obtain the student model through knowledge distillation and neural architecture search. We use the trained teacher discriminator to guide the student model and add feature matching loss to stabilize the training process. Experiments show that our method ameliorates the performance of compressed models.},

  abstract={The fast proliferation of digital twin (DT) establishes a direct connection between the physical entity and its deployed digital representation. As markets shift toward mass customization and new service delivery models, the digital representation has become more adaptive and agile by forming digital twin networks (DTNs). The DTN institutes a real-time single source of truth everywhere. However, there are several issues preventing DTNs from further application, including centralized processing, data falsification, privacy leakage, lack of incentive mechanism, and so on. To make DTN better meet the ever changing demands, we propose a novel block-chain-enabled adaptive asynchronous federated learning (FedTwin) paradigm for privacy-preserving and decentralized DTNs. We design Proof-of-Federalism (PoF), which is a tailor-made consensus algorithm for autonomous DTNs. In each DT's local training phase, generative adversarial network enhanced differential privacy is used to protect the privacy of local model parameters, while a modified Isolation Forest is deployed to filter out the falsified DTs. In the global aggregation phase, an improved Markov decision process is leveraged to select optimal DTs to achieve adaptive asynchronous aggregation while providing a rollback mechanism to redact the falsified global models. With this article, we aim to provide insights to forthcoming researchers and readers in this under-explored domain.},

  abstract={Emotion recognition (ER) in healthcare has drawn substantial attention owing to recent advancements in machine-learning (ML) and deep-learning (DL) techniques. The ER system, along with a digital twin of a person in real time, will facilitate the monitoring, understanding, and improvement of the physical entity’s capabilities, as well as provide constant input to improve quality of life and well-being for personalized healthcare. However, building such ER systems in real time involves technical challenges, such as limited datasets, occlusion and lighting issues, identifying important features, false classification of emotions, and high implementation costs. To resolve this issue, we built a simple, efficient, and adaptable ER system by acquiring and processing images in real time using a web camera. In addition, we propose an end-to-end framework that combines an ER system with a digital twin setup, in which the predicted result can be analyzed and tested prior to providing the best possible personal healthcare treatment before it leads to any life-threatening disease. Our proposed ER system achieved promising results in less training time without compromising the accuracy. Thus, in real time, it will be helpful in healthcare centers to monitor a patient’s health condition, early diagnosis of life-threatening diseases, and to obtain the best and most effective treatment for patients during emergencies.},

  pages={1-11},
  abstract={Current learning-based 3-D object detection accuracy is heavily impacted by the annotation quality. It is still a challenge to expect an overall high detection accuracy for all classes under different scenarios given the dataset sparsity. To mitigate this challenge, this article proposes a novel method called semi-supervised learning and progressive distillation (SPD), which uses semi-supervised learning (SSL) and knowledge distillation to improve label efficiency. The SPD uses two big backbones to hand the unlabeled/labeled input data augmented by the periodic IO augmentation (PA). Then the backbones are compressed using progressive distillation (PD). Precisely, PA periodically shifts the data augmentation operations between the input and output of the big backbone, aiming to improve the network&#x2019;s generalization of the unseen and unlabeled data. Using the big backbone can benefit from large-scale augmented data better than the small one. And two backbones are trained by the data scale and ratio-sensitive loss (data-loss). It solves the over-flat caused by the large-scale unlabeled data from PA and helps the big backbone prevent overfitting on the limited-scale labeled data. Hence, using the PA and data loss during SSL training dramatically improves the label efficiency. Next, the trained big backbone set as the teacher CNN is progressively distilled to obtain a small student model, referenced as PD. PD mitigates the problem that student CNN performance degrades when the gap between the student and the teacher is oversized. Extensive experiments are conducted on the indoor datasets SUN RGB-D and ScanNetV2 and outdoor dataset KITTI. Using only 50% labeled data and a 27% smaller model size, SPD performs 0.32 higher than the fully supervised VoteNetqi2019deep which is adopted as our backbone. Besides, using only 2% labeled data, compared to the other fully supervised backbone PV-RCNNshi2020pv, SPD accomplishes a similar accuracy (84.1 and 84.83) and 30% less inference time.},

  abstract={Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a fast-growing field, where reliable systems are made for high resource languages and for adult’s speech. However, performance of such ASR system is inefficient for children speech, due to numerous acoustic variability in children speech and scarcity of resources. In this paper, we propose to use the unlabeled data extensively to develop ASR system for low resourced children speech. State-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 is the baseline ASR technique used here. The baseline’s performance is further enhanced with the intuition of Noisy Student Teacher (NST) learning. The proposed technique is not only limited to introducing the use of soft labels (i.e., word-level transcription) of unlabeled data, but also adapts the learning of teacher model or preceding student model, which results in reduction of the redundant training significantly. To that effect, a detailed analysis is reported in this paper, as there is a difference in teacher and student learning. In ASR experiments, character-level tokenization was used and hence, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss was used for fine-tuning. Due to computational limitations, experiments are performed with approximately 12 hours of training, and 5 hours of development and test data was used from standard My Science Tutor (MyST) corpus. The baseline wav2vec 2.0 achieves 34% WER, while relatively 10% of performance was improved using the proposed approach. Further, the analysis of performance loss and effect of language model is discussed in details.},

  abstract={Myopia has become a major public health problem affecting the eye health of our citizens, especially teenagers. Fundus images can be obtained non-invasively and can be used to monitor and follow up on the progress in high myopia. However, with the development of artificial intelligence, it is still difficult to establish a computer-aided diagnosis model for high myopia with young children as research objects, mainly because 1) it is very difficult to collect labeled fundus images, and there is no large amount of such data that can be freely accessed; 2) hard samples which have clinical significance for population screening and diagnosis are rare and indistinguishable. To solve these problems, we propose a high myopia detection model on fundus images based on curriculum learning. We design a dual-curriculum generation module, which aims to use the expert model to endow the curriculum with new training indicators so that the student model can gradually and robustly identify hard samples. Compared with the baseline, our framework significantly improves the convergence speed of the training process and achieves the best performance during testing. Experimental results on a high myopia fundus images dataset show that our framework provides efficient and accurate detection and outperforms other methods.},

  abstract={Machine learning (ML) applications for wireless communications have gained momentum on the standardization discussions for 5G advanced and beyond. One of the biggest challenges for real world ML deployment is the need for labeled signals and big measurement campaigns. To overcome those problems, we propose the use of untrained neural networks (UNNs) for MIMO channel recreation/estimation and low over-head reporting. The UNNs learn the propagation environment by fitting a few channel measurements and we exploit their learned prior to provide higher channel estimation gains. Moreover, we present a UNN for simultaneous channel recreation for multiple users, or multiple user equipment (UE) positions, in which we have a trade-off between the estimated channel gain and the number of parameters. Our results show that transfer learning techniques are effective in accessing the learned prior on the environment structure as they provide higher channel gain for neighbouring users. Moreover, the proposed UNN channel state information (CSI) estimators are under-parameterized and can further enable low-overhead CSI reporting.},

Moreover, it can also fully combine IoT real-time data, large data analysis, and simulation, to make the best decisions. In the digital twin network, the data distribution and computing power of different device nodes shows great heterogeneity, but the internal node data are independent and identically distributed. Therefore, our learning algorithm should be able to learn not only the network commonality, but also the node specificity. In order to provide secure and personalised services for different device nodes, a polymorphic learning (PL) framework is proposed in this paper. PL divides the classical neural network model into a homomorphic model and a polymorphic model to realise flexible network control. Finally, the advantages of the PL algorithm in the collaborative optimisation of different nodes are proven through simulation experiments, and the algorithm running process is simulated through a classic case, with the final results proving the superiority of the algorithm.},

  abstract={Agriculture is an industry that is essential for the food supply for the world population. Although this industry is so important, there are many challenges associated with it, such as the pollution/waste present in the agricultural practices and the aging of the farmers. The application of technological solutions can provide a way to solve these challenges, by retrieving data from the physical environment, based on which future decisions can be taken, using actuators. The goal of this work is to present an architecture through which the different layers can communicate with each other’s, and then based on this architecture develop a system that can help monitor the agricultural fields. The project is applied in a controlled environment (a greenhouse), and the objective is to verify both the waste of water within the cultures, and if there are benefits in changing the plastics used on top of the soil in terms of production, from the traditional one (black), to a plastic that is white and thicker.},

  abstract={Future wireless services will focus on improving the quality of life by enabling various applications, such as extended reality, brain-computer interaction, and healthcare. These applications will have diverse performance requirements (e.g., user-defined quality of experience metrics, latency, and reliability) which will be challenging to be fulfilled by existing wireless systems. To meet the diverse requirements of the emerging applications, the concept of digital twins has been recently proposed. A digital twin uses a virtual representation along with security-related technologies (e.g., blockchain), communication technologies (e.g., 6G), computing technologies (e.g., edge computing), and machine learning, so as to enable the smart applications. In this tutorial, we present a comprehensive overview on digital twins for wireless systems. First, we present the fundamental concepts (i.e., design aspects, high-level architecture, and frameworks) of digital twins for wireless systems. Second, a comprehensive taxonomy is devised for two aspects, namely, twins for wireless and wireless for twins. For the twins for wireless aspect, we consider issues related to design of twin objects, physical devices, and interface, as well as prototyping, deployment trends, incentive mechanism, isolation of twins, and decoupling. For the wireless for twins aspect, we consider issues related to accessing twin objects, security and privacy, and air interface design are considered. Finally, open research challenges and opportunities are discussed.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation is an effective model compression technology. As the main research branch, the knowledge distillation based on the middle layer focuses on extracting the network representation knowledge in the hidden layer to improve student learning performance. To fully utilize the process knowledge of the teacher model, an algorithm of the feature reconstruction based on middle-layer feature maps is proposed, which embeds middle-layer feature maps of the student network into the teacher network group by group. We introduce the intermediate soft-hard label contained process knowledge of the network with the help of pre-trained module group of the teacher network in loss function. This can increase the coupling of the teacher-student network in the process of knowledge transfer and improve the intrinsic knowledge inheritance of the compressed student model to the teacher network. The experimental results on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 verify the effectiveness and scalability of this method.},

Although it is known that especially young people aim to play games, their combination with learning is mainly limited to simulations. This does not have a high impact on intrinsic motivation. This paper provides an engine to create adventure games with a virtual world based on images and a dialog-based storyline. Learners interact with virtual entities in plausible contexts using the foreign language only. If learners are unaware of a word’s meaning, cheating is possible, enhancing the user model. Based on that, learning material can be generated to practice unknown vocab by regularly interrupting the game. The generated micro-course needs to be finished before the game continues.

  pages={138-148},
  abstract={To realize high-accuracy physical-cyber digital twin (DT) mapping in a manufacturing system, a huge amount of data need to be collected and analyzed in real-time. Traditional DTs systems are deployed in cloud or edge servers independently, whilst it is hard to apply in real production systems due to the high interaction or execution delay. This results in a low consistency in the temporal dimension of the physical-cyber model. In this work, we propose a novel efficient edge-cloud DT manufacturing system, which is inspired by resource scheduling technology. Specifically, an edge-cloud collaborative DTs system deployment architecture is first constructed. Then, deterministic and uncertainty optimization adaptive strategies are presented to choose a more powerful server for running DT-based applications. We model the adaptive optimization problems as dynamic programming problems and propose a novel collaborative clustering parallel Q-learning (CCPQL) algorithm and prediction-based CCPQL to solve the problems. The proposed approach reduces the total delay with a higher convergence rate. Numerical simulation results are provided to validate the approach, which would have great potential in dynamic and complex industrial internet environments.},

  abstract={In the transportation business, battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs) are regarded the immediate solution to internal combustion engines in light of the growth in environmental pollution. While expanding the use of electric vehicles, battery-related difficulties such as range anxiety, safety concerns, cost, and the availability of charging stations are important concerns. A precise online estimate of the battery’s State of Health (SoH) has the ability to resolve some of these issues. However, computing the SoH on EVs is computationally intensive, necessitating expensive onboard integrated electronics and rapidly draining the EV battery. In addition, the SoH estimating algorithms currently available do not utilise incremental battery usage data. This research presents a digital twin of the EV battery as a solution to the difficulty of onboard computation for incremental SoH prediction. It enables intensive computing and analytics to be performed in the cloud instead of a vehicle’s battery management system (BMS). It calculates the SoH of the battery using an incremental learning method with a mean square error of 0.023.},

  abstract={The widespread adoption of EVs is limited by their reliance on batteries with presently low energy and power densities compared to liquid fuels and are subject to aging and performance deterioration over time. For this reason, monitoring the battery state of charge and state of health during the EV lifetime is a very relevant problem. This work proposes the structure of a battery digital twin designed to reflect battery dynamics at the run time accurately. To ensure a high degree of correctness concerning non-linear phenomena, the digital twin relies on data-driven models trained on traces of battery evolution over time: a state of health model, repeatedly executed to estimate the degradation of maximum battery capacity, and a state of charge model, retrained periodically to reflect the impact of aging. The proposed digital twin structure will be exemplified on a public dataset to motivate its adoption and prove its effectiveness, with a high degree of accuracy and inference and retraining times compatible with onboard execution.},

  abstract={Energy efficiency in buildings is a key issue in the context of smart cities and should embrace a more intensive use of renewable energies. As such, many European countries are now promoting the use of solar energy for hot water production, giving financial incentives and introducing mandatory building regulations. It is proposed a framework for the development of a digital twin-based management system for a solar heating system. This is a concept framework and thus no results are yet available. The proposed framework takes advantage of the latest technologies, machine learning, IoT, experience-based information interchange between the physical system and the digital twin to achieve energy efficiency optimization. This novel approach integrates connectionist models and optimization techniques, bringing together complementary reasoning strategies for efficient energy use in real-time. This framework contributes to a better understanding of the effectiveness of digital twins on the automation of energy-dependent systems and explores new dimensions concerning the integration of autonomous intelligent management systems into physical systems.},

  abstract={With the acceleration of aging and the rapid upgrading of smart home devices, the solitary elderly of empty nest inevitably face the whirlpool of smart equipment. Lack of escort and assistance from their younger generations and third-party service, the senior's sense of loneliness and loss of control over smart home has become increasingly prominent. The authors of this article established a remote collaboration system for smart home (RCSSH) based on digital twin (DT) and mixed reality (MR), which achieves the cooperation between remote users (family juniors) and home users (the seniors) to complete auxiliary tasks such as remote company, management of smart devices, etc. In addition to sharing immersive perspectives and collaborative elements, the system also collects home environment data via hardware of internet of things (IoT) and displays them in the DT space to enrich the collaboration experience. Using augmented reality (AR) and remote interaction beyond physical space, the system can reduce the learning burden of smart homes for the in-home seniors through the bilateral remote collaboration, and expand the means that remote family members accompany their seniors, that make up for the loss of self-value for the elderly.},

This article describes a system of ontological models (Learner Model, educational content model and cognitive functions model) designed to diagnose students’ characteristics and the subsequent issuance of educational content, taking into account these characteristics. The learner model, implemented as a Protege ontology, is based not only on human professional experience but also on student testing results. This approach, based on the use of various IQ tests, allows reflecting in the ontology the dependencies identified due to linear regression methods, as well as other types of analysis. By this way we will reduce the dependence of the model on the human expert’s personality and make it more objective. Using the Protege tools, we will combine three ontologies in the architecture of a personalized environment through rules and axioms.},

  abstract={As the effects of climate change are becoming more and more evident, the importance of improved situation awareness is also gaining more attention, both in the context of preventive environmental monitoring and in the context of acute crisis response. One important aspect of situation awareness is the correct and thorough monitoring of air pollutants. The monitoring is threatened by sensor faults, power or network failures, or other hazards leading to missing or incorrect data transmission. For this reason, in this work we propose two complementary approaches for predicting missing sensor data and a combined technique for detecting outliers. The proposed solution can enhance the performance of low-cost sensor systems, closing the gap of missing measurements due to network unavailability, detecting drift and outliers thus paving the way to its use as an alert system for reportable events. The techniques have been deployed and tested also in a low power microcontroller environment, verifying the suitability of such a computing power to perform the inference locally, leading the way to an edge implementation of a virtual sensor digital twin.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={An electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is currently accepted as a standard for automatic sleep staging. Lately, Near-human accuracy in automated sleep staging has been achievable by Deep Learning (DL) based approaches, enabling multi-fold progress in this area. However, An extensive and expensive clinical setup is required for EEG based sleep staging. Additionally, the EEG setup being obtrusive in nature and requiring an expert for setup adds to the inconvenience of the subject under study, making it adverse in the point of care setting. An unobtrusive and more suitable alternative to EEG is Electrocardiogram (ECG). Unsurprisingly, compared to EEG in sleep staging, its performance remains sub-par. In order to take advantage of both the modalities, transferring knowledge from EEG to ECG is a reasonable approach, ultimately boosting the performance of ECG based sleep staging. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a promising notion in DL that shares knowledge from a superior performing but usually more complex teacher model to an inferior but compact student model. Building upon this concept, a cross-modality KD framework assisting features learned through models trained on EEG to improve ECG-based sleep staging performance is proposed. Additionally, to better understand the distillation approach, extensive experimentation on the independent modules of the proposed model was conducted. Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) dataset consisting of 200 subjects was utilized for this study. The results from the proposed model for weighted-F1-score in 3-class and 4-class sleep staging showed a 13.40 % and 14.30 % improvement, respectively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of KD for single-channel ECG based sleep staging's performance enhancement in 3-class (W-R-N) and 4-class (W-R-L-D) classification.},

  pages={1329-1341},
  abstract={We present RemixIT, a simple yet effective self-supervised method for training speech enhancement without the need of a single isolated in-domain speech nor a noise waveform. Our approach overcomes limitations of previous methods which make them dependent on clean in-domain target signals and thus, sensitive to any domain mismatch between train and test samples. RemixIT is based on a continuous self-training scheme in which a pre-trained teacher model on out-of-domain data infers estimated pseudo-target signals for in-domain mixtures. Then, by permuting the estimated clean and noise signals and remixing them together, we generate a new set of bootstrapped mixtures and corresponding pseudo-targets which are used to train the student network. Vice-versa, the teacher periodically refines its estimates using the updated parameters of the latest student models. Experimental results on multiple speech enhancement datasets and tasks not only show the superiority of our method over prior approaches but also showcase that RemixIT can be combined with any separation model as well as be applied towards any semi-supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation task. Our analysis, paired with empirical evidence, sheds light on the inside functioning of our self-training scheme wherein the student model keeps obtaining better performance while observing severely degraded pseudo-targets.},

The first section addresses the increasing requirements to integrate social modeling to support the evaluation of the socio-economic impact of policies, including questions of equity. Artificial societies are presented as enablers. The second section observes that the purpose of a simulation model is very much linked to its usefulness for supporting policy decisions. This implies requirements for learning agents and better representation of time and space. The third section focuses on the need to give agents more active behavior, to let them drive the action. While digital twin technology promises to help, the current state of the art seems insufficient. The section closes by looking at trust in simulation models, which will be needed for policy support.},

  abstract={Deep Metric Learning (DML) methods have been proven relevant for visual similarity learning. However, they sometimes lack generalization properties because they are trained often using an inappropriate sample selection strategy or due to the difficulty of the dataset caused by a distributional shift in the data. These represent a significant drawback when attempting to learn the underlying data manifold. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop better ways of obtaining generalization and representation of the underlying manifold. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to DML that we call Guided Deep Metric Learning, a novel architecture oriented to learning more compact clusters, improving generalization under distributional shifts in DML. This novel architecture consists of two independent models: A multi-branch master model, inspired from a Few-Shot Learning (FSL) perspective, generates a reduced hypothesis space based on prior knowledge from labeled data, which guides or regularizes the decision boundary of a student model during training under an offline knowledge distillation scheme. Experiments have shown that the proposed method is capable of a better manifold generalization and representation to up to 40% improvement (Recall@1, CIFAR10), using guidelines suggested by Musgrave et al. to perform a more fair and realistic comparison, which is currently absent in the literature.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={4230-4239},
  abstract={Despite the outstanding success of self-supervised pretraining methods for video representation learning, they generalise poorly when the unlabeled dataset for pretraining is small or the domain difference between unlabelled data in source task (pretraining) and labeled data in target task (finetuning) is significant. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel approach to complement self-supervised pretraining via an auxiliary pretraining phase, based on knowledge similarity distillation, auxSKD, for better generalisation with a significantly smaller amount of video data, e.g. Kinetics-100 rather than Kinetics-400. Our method deploys a teacher network that iteratively distils its knowledge to the student model by capturing the similarity information between segments of unlabelled video data. The student model meanwhile solves a pretext task by exploiting this prior knowledge. We also introduce a novel pretext task, Video Segment Pace Prediction or VSPP, which requires our model to predict the playback speed of a randomly selected segment of the input video to provide more reliable self-supervised representations. Our experimental results show superior results to the state of the art on both UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets when pretraining on K100 in apple-to-apple comparisons. Additionally, we show that our auxiliary pretraining, auxSKD, when added as an extra pretraining phase to recent state of the art self-supervised methods (i.e. VCOP, VideoPace, and RSPNet), improves their results on UCF101 and HMDB51.

  year={2022},
  volume={71},
  number={},
  pages={1-12},
  abstract={This article proposes an efficient federated distillation learning system (EFDLS) for multitask time series classification (TSC). EFDLS consists of a central server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run different TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components: a feature-based student–teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM) scheme. For each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its teacher’s hidden layers to its student’s hidden layers via knowledge distillation, where the teacher and student have identical network structures. For each connected user, its student model’s hidden layers’ weights are uploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the server, with the least square distance (LSD) used to measure the similarity between the weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected user such that the user’s and its partner’s weights are the closest among all the weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user’s and its partner’s weights to these two users which then load the received weights to their teachers’ hidden layers. Experimental results show that compared with a number of state-of-the-art federated learning (FL) algorithms, our proposed EFDLS wins 20 out of 44 standard UCR2018 datasets and achieves the highest mean accuracy (70.14%) on these datasets. In particular, compared with a single-task baseline, EFDLS obtains 32/4/8 regarding “win”/“tie”/“lose” and results in an improvement of approximately 4% in terms of mean accuracy.},

  abstract={In this article, we proposed an autonomous mobile robot (AMR) capable of conducting multiple deep learning inferences by a computing network as a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). In view of industry 4.0, a five-layered CPS architecture including Component, Intelligence, Cyber, Configuration, and Deployment was devised. Mechatronic control of the two-wheeled self-balancing AMR presents the first challenge to embedded computing, whereas multiple deep learning modules for visual navigation and localization further escalate the stake. To meet the challenge of real-time and affordable computing, we constructed an embedded cluster based on Raspberry Pi4s and Intel NCS2 for simultaneous intelligent inference and data exchange. We tested the performances of three networking methods, Network File System (NFS), Socket Server with Multiple Clients (SSMC), and ROS TO PIC (ROS-T), and reported the comparison. We also conducted a series of field tests on autonomous corridor navigation, localization, object delivery, and object pick-and-place to verify the performance of the self-balancing AMR. The results showed high success rates with sufficient spatial precision, stability, and robust loop closure. The web-based console realizes the functions of the digital twin and provides connectivity to higher-level management systems.},

  abstract={The sixth-generation (6G) wireless network is conceptualized to provide ubiquitous and reliable network access through effective inter-networking among space, air, and terrestrial networks, while posing considerable pressure on dynamic network orchestration. Digital twin (DT) provides an alternative approach to proactively make real-time resource allocation by mapping and learning the complex network topology. However, the dual challenges of limited energy capacity and insufficient computing power of unmanned aerial vehicles make it difficult to establish digital twin on aerial networks. In light of this, in this paper, we propose a lightweight DT empowered air-ground network architecture, where the DT modelling task is distributed to diverse ground devices based on federated learning. To improve the efficiency of DT modelling, we design a distributed incentive mechanism that incentivizes high-performance ground devices to take part in federated learning. Considering the computing burden and possible private disclosure caused by the incentive, we further solve the incentive scheme with a new distributed algorithm. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight DT scheme in energy consumption and model accuracy.},

  year={2022},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Task scheduling is a critical problem when one user offloads multiple different tasks to the edge server. When a user has multiple tasks to offload and only one task can be transmitted to server at a time, while server processes tasks according to the transmission order, the problem is NP-hard. However, it is difficult for traditional optimization methods to quickly obtain the optimal solution, while approaches based on reinforcement learning face with the challenge of excessively large action space and slow convergence. In this paper, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-assisted RL-based task scheduling method in order to improve the performance and convergence of the RL. We use DT to simulate the results of different decisions made by the agent, so that one agent can try multiple actions at a time, or, similarly, multiple agents can interact with environment in parallel in DT. In this way, the exploration efficiency of RL can be significantly improved via DT, and thus RL can converges faster and local optimality is less likely to happen. Particularly, two algorithms are designed to made task scheduling decisions, i.e., DT-assisted asynchronous Q-learning (DTAQL) and DT-assisted exploring Q-learning (DTEQL). Simulation results show that both algorithms significantly improve the convergence speed of Q-learning by increasing the exploration efficiency.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={In-depth analysis of medical data through machine learning to achieve disease prediction is beneficial to the early detection and treatment of diseases. However, medical data involves mass patient privacy, and datasets of different medical institutions cannot be directly shared due to privacy protection. So medical data often exists in the form of data islands, which makes it difficult for most existing prediction models to complete disease prediction. In this paper, a digital twin assisted efficient clustering Federated Learning (FL) algorithm for disease prediction is proposed. It can break data islands to predict diseases on the premise of privacy security. Firstly, we design an efficient clustering Federated Learning with Client Selection (FLCS) protocol based on heterogeneity and contribution to improve the training efficiency and prediction accuracy. Secondly, we use digital twin to assist the FLCS protocol to carry out large-scale prediction. In addition, the shapley value introduced in the calculation of client contribution makes the model interpretable and enhances the reliability of prediction results. Finally, the evaluation results show that compared with the common prediction models and FedAvg algorithm, the FLCS protocol assisted by digital twin has better efficiency and accuracy in binary classification prediction.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT), which integrates physical networks and digital space by using advanced technologies of sensing, communication and computation, has been envisioned as a promising paradigm for improving the quality of service in physical systems. In this paper, we propose a federated learning (FL)-enabled DT system consisting of the physical layer and DT layer. With FL, all wireless devices (WDs) can collaborate to update a universal DT model, after the DT server cluster (DSC) aggregates all the local models sent by the WDs with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Moreover, an action model based on the DT system is also updated to optimize the operations of WDs. To increase the energy efficiency, we formulate a problem to minimize the cost of the total energy consumption of the system by optimizing the time allocation of local training, uploading the local models, generating the action model as well as broadcasting the action model and DT model. The numerical results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={In the heterogeneous vehicular networks (HetVNets), the base stations (BSs) can exploit the massive amounts of valuable data collected by vehicles to complete federated learning tasks. However, most of the existing studies consider the scenario of one task requester (TR) and ignore the fact that multiple TRs may concurrently generate their model training requests in the HetVNets. In this paper, we consider the scenario of multi-TR and multi-BS and propose a digital twin enabled scheme for multitask federated learning to address the two-way selection problem between the TRs and the BSs. We first analyze the diversified requirements of the TRs in the HetVNets. Then, we develop a novel model that jointly considers the available training data, the declared price, and the training experience to evaluate the differentiated training capabilities of the BSs. After that, based on the requirements of the TRs and the training capabilities of the BSs, the two-way selection problem between the TRs and the BSs is formulated as a matching game in the digital twin networks, where a matching algorithm is designed to obtain their optimal strategies. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can obtain the highest model accuracy and bring the highest utility to the TRs compared with the conventional schemes.},

  abstract={The human digital twin (HDT) is a new paradigm that possesses the ability to revolutionize the current healthcare systems. With HDT, ensuring an efficient connectivity scheme between each human-virtual twin pair remains a significant problem. As the concept of HDT is new, conventional connectivity schemes cannot meet the unique requirements of HDT in terms of reliability, security and privacy. This paper thus proposes an edge-assisted connectivity scheme for HDT and adopts an integrated blockchain and federated learning techniques to ensure security and privacy. To minimize long-term average connectivity cost, we formulated the connectivity problem as a Markov decision process and adopted the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to learn the optimal connectivity policy in terms of connectivity cost. The obtained results were then compared with the conventional deep Q-network-based solution. The results show that the proposed DDPG-based connectivity solution is feasible to perform the connectivity process better by optimally allocating system resources, thus reducing the overall connectivity cost, while ensuring data security and privacy.},

  abstract={Incremental learning methods can learn new classes continually by distilling knowledge from the last model (as a teacher model) to the current model (as a student model) in the sequentially learning process. However, these methods cannot work for Incremental Implicitly-Refined Classification (IIRC), an incremental learning extension where the incoming classes could have two granularity levels, a superclass label and a subclass label. This is because the previously learned superclass knowledge may be occupied by the sub-class knowledge learned sequentially. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation (MTKD) strategy. To preserve the subclass knowledge, we use the last model as a general teacher to distill the previous knowledge for the student model. To preserve the superclass knowledge, we use the initial model as a superclass teacher to distill the superclass knowledge as the initial model contains abundant superclass knowledge. However, distilling knowledge from two teacher models could result in the student model making some redundant predictions. We further propose a post-processing mechanism, called as Top-k prediction restriction to reduce the redundant predictions. Our experimental results on IIRC-ImageNet120 and IIRC-CIFAR100 show that the proposed method can achieve better classification accuracy compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.},

Secondly, we design a teacher-student framework in which the teacher model supervises the student model to learn the multiple granularity features with a soft triplet loss. Finally, we use the concatenation of multiple granularity features to generate better pseudo labels for local features. Extensive experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method on Market1501, DukeMTMC, MSMT17 datasets significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art UDA Re-ID methods by a large margin.},

In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning framework for online parameter personalization of ICDs. Heart states can be inferred from ECG signals from ECG patches, which can be used to create a digital twin of the patient. Reinforcement learning then use the digital twin as environment to explore parameter settings with less misdiagnosis. Experiments were performed on three virtual patients with specific and evolving heart conditions, and the result shows that our proposed approach can identify ICD parameter settings that can achieve better performance compared to default parameter settings.

  abstract={Although teleconsultation and robot-based remote teleoperation in ultrasonography have facilitated reliable image acquisition, lack of training still seriously affects the accuracy of ultrasound diagnosis. In order to improve physicians’ scanning skills, a more efficient training process is needed. However, present ultrasound training methods, such as the training phantom, are too costly for individual training. To explore new methods for training, the combined use of vision-based location tracking, motion sensing, and virtual ultrasound generation methods was studied in this work to offer a more low-cost and intuitive interaction system for virtual ultrasound scanning. The feasibility of the proposed workflow was verified by a user study on simple tasks and a clinical evaluation on a virtual ultrasound examination of three fetal heart specimens. As a result, the proposed interaction device facilitated virtual ultrasound examination by making it more efficient and intuitive, according to objective and subjective measurements. Therefore, while virtual ultrasound provides great data extensibility, the proposed device provides a smooth interaction, making the system simple and cost-effective for the end user. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method could provide a promising education system for the trainee to understand standard views of echocardiography and the corresponding anatomical correlations.},

  abstract={Condition monitoring of manufacturing processes plays a vital role in the era of Industry 4.0 and sustainable development goals. The use of condition monitoring enables soft sensing of indirectly measurable or non-measurable production indicators, e.g., cutting forces, as the foundation for a digital shadow or digital twin powered by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing techniques. Hence, when properly applied, it leads to an improvement in process understanding, production planning, quality control, and predictive maintenance. Despite these merits, the adaptability and reliability of condition monitoring at the production field level are limited by the modeling uncertainties due to the rapidly changing industrial environment driven by dynamic customer demands. This study presents a novel strategy to overcome these shortcomings by employing machine internal signals and prior knowledge-embedded machine learning techniques. A concept of incorporating production domain-specific physical models and logical rules into generalized data-driven methods is proposed. A hybrid learning force model based on machine internal signals was constructed. As a result, the soft sensor encompasses stochastic effects that are neglected in the existing model and estimates the reliability of the modeled findings. Prospectively, this allows for online parametrization of the model within dynamically changing conditions. This concept is exemplarily implemented in an industrial use case.},

The experimental results indicate that digital twins technology has a good effect. The two-layer cloud database model costs US$11, 476.1, the lowest among comparative models. The unencrypted Amazon Relational Database Service has the best performance.

  pages={368-374},
  abstract={Medical image segmentation plays an important role in medical diagnosis and treatment. However, medical image data are more expensive and time-consuming to obtain than ordinary image data. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised method named CAU for medical image segmentation, which can easily use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to segment 2D images. The network learns through a combination of common supervision losses for labeled data and losses for unlabeled data. Specifically, we augment the unlabeled data strongly and weakly and send them to the student model and the teacher model respectively. We take full advantage of unlabeled data learning through a novel combination of minimizing the difference between network predictions for different data augmentation processing scenarios and using an unsupervised loss of min-entropy on the outputs of the two networks. In order to improve the regularization effect, we use the teacher-student model to optimize the teacher model by averaging the student model weights. Experiments show that our method in labeled data experiments with 5%, 10%,35% and 50% labeled data on Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challeng(ACDC) dataset exceeds the fully supervised algorithm using the same amount of data and the existing popular semi-supervised learning algorithms 1.922% ~ 4.451%(Dice),0.841 ~ 5.031(Asd) and 0.06 ~ 1.116(HD95), respectively, and the Dice index exceeds the fully supervised algorithm 0.019% with 50% labeled data, which verifies its effectiveness in medical image segmentation.},

  abstract={The increasingly complex network architecture and numerous emerging network services make it difficult for traditional “best effort” consumer Internet to support current Production Internet/5G requirements for differentiated SLA commitments, low latency, and deterministic bandwidth. To solve various difficulties and challenges faced by the development of ultra-large-scale networks, the Digital Twin Network has become a research hotspot. In this paper, based on the traffic modeling problem involved in the digital twin layer of digital twin network architecture, we proposed an intelligent awareness method for delay-sensitive network traffic. Through the real-time awareness of delay-sensitive traffic, intelligent routing of network services is realized and meets the requirements of scenarios, such as high-value traffic assurance and intelligence traffic scheduling and grooming for network congestion. We experimentally confirmed the scheme by traffic data collected in realistic network environments, and it has an awareness accuracy of more than 90%.},

  year={2022},

  pages={1578-1591},
  abstract={Knowledge of channel state information (CSI) is fundamental to many functionalities for mobile communication systems. With the advance of machine learning (ML) and digital maps, i.e., digital twins, we have a big opportunity to learn the propagation environment and design novel methods to derive and report CSI. In this work, we propose to combine untrained neural networks (UNNs) and conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) for MIMO channel recreation based on prior knowledge. The UNNs learn the prior-CSI for some locations which are used to build the input to a cGAN. Based on the prior-CSI estimates, their locations and the location of the desired channel, the cGAN is trained to output the channel expected at the desired location. This combined approach can be used for low overhead CSI reporting as, after training, we only need to report the desired location. Our results show that our CSI recreation method is successful in modelling the wireless channel under different configurations of prior-CSI spatial sampling. In addition, the results consider a real world measurement campaign for indoor line of sight and non-line of sight channels. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) achieved by our CSI recreation is better than the SNR reported by the measured campaign providers. Moreover, our CSI recreation provides means for low overhead CSI reporting as the UNN structure is underparameterized compared to the full explicit CSI, and only the desired location is needed for the cGAN to recreate the desired CSI.},

  abstract={Digital mymargin Twin (DT) and Intelligent Reflective Surface (IRS), the most two promising technologies of 6G make the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) more adaptive. However, future autonomous driving needs powerful networking resources and high-quality wireless communications to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS). Especially considering the time-varying physical operating environments of IoV, it is extremely urgent to improve resource utilization and wireless channel quality. In this work, we propose a Digital Twin-Driven Vehicular Task Offloading and IRS Configuration Framework (DTVIF) to efficiently monitor, learn, and manage the IoV. Specifically, we adopt Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and IRS to provide augmented computing capacities for vehicles and improve transmission performance when vehicles communicate to MEC servers. DT is employed to achieve real-time data collection and digital representation of physical operating environments of IoV to better support decisions making. In order to reduce the overall delay and energy consumption of DTVIF, we propose a Two-Stage Optimization for Jointly Optimizing Task Offloading and IRS Configuration (TSJTI) algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Transfer Learning (TFL). In the first stage, we introduce Double Deep  $Q$ -learning Networks (DDQN) to find the optimal offloading decision. In the second stage, based on the parameters learned from the first stage, we migrate the parameters from the first stage to find the optimal IRS configuration based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the processing latency of task offloading and reduce the average energy consumption in DTVIF.},

  abstract={More than 60 waste incineration plants (WIPs) are active across Germany. WIPs have various levels of automation, but they still rely on manual operations by human operators. Human operators tend to rely on a few operational levers and infrequent interventions to manage the complex combustion process. Consequently, the combustion process is managed rather inefficiently, and steam outputs and emission levels are not optimal. This article investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) can help enhance process automation and, thus, optimize the combustion process, e.g., by making more frequent and diverse interventions. An RL agent is trained via trial and error with a reward function that includes the optimization criteria. Since the actual equipment, i.e., the real WIP, cannot be used as the training environment, a digital twin is built using original plant data and a neural network. The RL agent is then trained in this offline environment with the deep Q-network algorithm. First, our work demonstrates that a digital twin of a WIP can be built in a data-driven way. Second, we show that the RL agent outperforms the human operator. Thus, the application of RL might benefit the plant operator in financial terms and the environment in terms of reduced emission levels.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology surrounded by many promises, and potentials to reshape the future of industries and society overall. A DT is a system-of-systems which goes far beyond the traditional computer-based simulations and analysis. It is a replication of all the elements, processes, dynamics, and firmware of a physical system into a digital counterpart. The two systems (physical and digital) exist side by side, sharing all the inputs and operations using real-time data communications and information transfer. With the incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3D models, next generation mobile communications (5G/6G), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), distributed computing, Transfer Learning (TL), and electronic sensors, the digital/virtual counterpart of the real-world system is able to provide seamless monitoring, analysis, evaluation and predictions. The DT offers a platform for the testing and analysing of complex systems, which would be impossible in traditional simulations and modular evaluations. However, the development of this technology faces many challenges including the complexities in effective communication and data accumulation, data unavailability to train Machine Learning (ML) models, lack of processing power to support high fidelity twins, the high need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and the absence of standardized development methodologies and validation measures. Being in the early stages of development, DTs lack sufficient documentation. In this context, this survey paper aims to cover the important aspects in realization of the technology. The key enabling technologies, challenges and prospects of DTs are highlighted. The paper provides a deep insight into the technology, lists design goals and objectives, highlights design challenges and limitations across industries, discusses research and commercial developments, provides its applications and use cases, offers case studies in industry, infrastructure and healthcare, lists main service providers and stakeholders, and covers developments to date, as well as viable research dimensions for future developments in DTs.},

  abstract={In this paper, an ill-posed problem of multiple adverse weather removal is investigated. Our goal is to train a model with a ‘unified’ architecture and only one set of pretrained weights that can tackle multiple types of adverse weathers such as haze, snow, and rain simultaneously. To this end, a two-stage knowledge learning mechanism including knowledge collation (KC) and knowledge examination (KE) based on a multi-teacher and student architecture is proposed. At the KC, the student network aims to learn the comprehensive bad weather removal problem from multiple well-trained teacher networks where each of them is specialized in a specific bad weather removal problem. To accomplish this process, a novel collaborative knowledge transfer is proposed. At the KE, the student model is trained without the teacher networks and examined by challenging pixel loss derived by the ground truth. Moreover, to improve the performance of our training framework, a novel loss function called multi-contrastive knowledge regularization (MCR) loss is proposed. Experiments on several datasets show that our student model can achieve promising results on different bad weather removal tasks simultaneously. The code is available in our project page.},

  pages={7571-7580},
  abstract={We address the task of domain adaptation in object detection, where there is an obvious domain gap between a domain with annotations (source) and a domain of interest without annotations (target). As a popular semi-supervised learning method, the teacher-student framework (a student model is supervised by the pseudo labels from a teacher model) has also yielded a large accuracy gain in cross-domain object detection. However, it suffers from the domain shift and generates many low-quality pseudo labels (e.g., false positives), which leads to sub-optimal performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose a teacher-student framework named Adaptive Teacher (AT) which leverages domain adversarial learning and weak-strong data augmentation to address the domain gap. Specifically, we employ feature-level adversarial training in the student model, allowing features derived from the source and target domains to share similar distributions. This process ensures the student model produces domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we apply weak-strong augmentation and mutual learning between the teacher model (taking data from the target domain) and the student model (taking data from both domains). This enables the teacher model to learn the knowledge from the student model without being biased to the source domain. We show that AT demonstrates superiority over existing approaches and even Oracle (fully-supervised) models by a large margin. For example, we achieve 50.9% (49.3%) mAP on Foggy Cityscape (Cli-part1K), which is 9.2% (5.2%) and 8.2% (11.0%) higher than previous state-of-the-art and Oracle, respectively.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation aims to compress a powerful yet cumbersome teacher model into a lightweight student model without much sacrifice of performance. For this purpose, various approaches have been proposed over the past few years, generally with elaborately designed knowledge rep-resentations, which in turn increase the difficulty of model development and interpretation. In contrast, we empirically show that a simple knowledge distillation technique is enough to significantly narrow down the teacher-student performance gap. We directly reuse the discriminative classifier from the pre-trained teacher model for student inference and train a student encoder through feature alignment with a single ℓ2 loss. In this way, the student model is able to achieve exactly the same performance as the teacher model provided that their extracted features are perfectly aligned. An additional projector is developed to help the student encoder match with the teacher classifier, which renders our technique applicable to various teacher and student architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art results at the modest cost of compression ratio due to the added projector.},

  pages={8469-8478},
  abstract={This article addresses the problem of distilling knowledge from a large teacher model to a slim student network for LiDAR semantic segmentation. Directly employing previous distillation approaches yields inferior results due to the intrinsic challenges of point cloud, i.e., sparsity, randomness and varying density. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we propose the Point-to-Voxel Knowledge Distillation (PVD), which transfers the hidden knowledge from both point level and voxel level. Specifically, we first leverage both the pointwise and voxelwise output distillation to complement the sparse supervision signals. Then, to better exploit the structural information, we divide the whole point cloud into several supervoxels and design a difficulty-aware sampling strategy to more frequently sample supervoxels containing less-frequent classes and faraway objects. On these supervoxels, we propose inter-point and inter-voxel affinity distillation, where the similarity information between points and voxels can help the student model better capture the structural information of the surrounding environment. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular LiDAR segmentation benchmarks, i.e., nuScenes [3] and SemanticKITTI [1]. On both benchmarks, our PVD-consistently outperforms previous distillation approaches by a large margin on three representative backbones, i.e., Cylinder3D [36], [37], SPVNAS [25] and MinkowskiNet [5]. Notably, on the challenging nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets, our method can achieve roughly 75% MACs reduction and 2× speedup on the competitive Cylinder3D model and rank 1st on the SemanticKITTI leaderboard among all published algorithms11https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20331#results (single-scan competition) till 2021-11-18 04:00 Pacific Time, and our method is termed Point-Voxel-KD.

  pages={7010-7021},
  abstract={Open-vocabulary instance segmentation aims at segmenting novel classes without mask annotations. It is an important step toward reducing laborious human supervision. Most existing works first pretrain a model on captioned images covering many novel classes and then finetune it on limited base classes with mask annotations. However, the high-level textual information learned from caption pretraining alone cannot effectively encode the details required for pixelwise segmentation. To address this, we propose a cross-modal pseudo-labeling framework, which generates training pseudo masks by aligning word semantics in captions with visual features of object masks in images. Thus, our framework is capable of labeling novel classes in captions via their word semantics to self-train a student model. To account for noises in pseudo masks, we design a robust student model that selectively distills mask knowledge by estimating the mask noise levels, hence mitigating the adverse impact of noisy pseudo masks. By extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of our framework, where we significantly improve mAP score by 4.5% on MS-COCO and 5.1 % on the large-scale Open Images & Conceptual Captions datasets compared to the state-of-the-art.11Code is available at https://github.com/hbdat/cvpr22_cross_modal_pseudo_labeling.},

  abstract={Semi-supervised object detection has made significant progress with the development of mean teacher driven self-training. Despite the promising results, the label mismatch problem is not yet fully explored in the previous works, leading to severe confirmation bias during self-training. In this paper, we delve into this problem and propose a simple yet effective LabelMatch framework from two different yet complementary perspectives, i.e., distribution-level and instance-level. For the former one, it is reasonable to approximate the class distribution of the unlabeled data from that of the labeled data according to Monte Carlo Sampling. Guided by this weakly supervision cue, we introduce a re-distribution mean teacher, which leverages adaptive label-distribution-aware confidence thresholds to generate unbiased pseudo labels to drive student learning. For the latter one, there exists an overlooked label assignment ambiguity problem across teacher-student models. To remedy this issue, we present a novel label assignment mechanism for self-training framework, namely proposal self-assignment, which injects the proposals from student into teacher and generates accurate pseudo labels to match each proposal in the student model accordingly. Experiments on both MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC datasets demonstrate the considerable superiority of our proposed framework to other state-of-the-arts.

  abstract={Prototypical methods have recently gained a lot of attention due to their intrinsic interpretable nature, which is obtained through the prototypes. With growing use cases of model reuse and distillation, there is a need to also study transfer of interpretability from one model to another. We present Proto2Proto, a novel method to transfer interpretability of one prototypical part network to another via knowledge distillation. Our approach aims to add interpretability to the “dark” knowledge transferred from the teacher to the shallower student model. We propose two novel losses: “Global Explanation” loss and “Patch-Prototype Correspondence” loss to facilitate such a transfer. Global Explanation loss forces the student prototypes to be close to teacher prototypes, and Patch-Prototype Cor-respondence loss enforces the local representations of the student to be similar to that of the teacher. Further, we propose three novel metrics to evaluate the student's proximity to the teacher as measures of interpretability transfer in our settings. We qualitatively and quantitatively demon-strate the effectiveness of our method on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets. Our experiments show that the proposed method indeed achieves interpretability transfer from teacher to student while simultaneously exhibiting competitive performance.

  number={},
  pages={908-917},
  abstract={Fusion of multiple sensor modalities such as camera, Lidar, and Radar, which are commonly found on autonomous vehicles, not only allows for accurate detection but also robustifies perception against adverse weather conditions and individual sensor failures. Due to inherent sensor characteristics, Radar performs well under extreme weather conditions (snow, rain, fog) that significantly degrade camera and Lidar. Recently, a few works have developed vehicle detection methods fusing Lidar and Radar signals, i.e., MVD-Net. However, these models are typically developed under the assumption that the models always have access to two error-free sensor streams. If one of the sensors is unavailable or missing, the model may fail catastrophically. To mitigate this problem, we propose the Self-Training Multimodal Vehicle Detection Network (ST-MVDNet) which leverages a Teacher-Student mutual learning framework and a simulated sensor noise model used in strong data augmentation for Lidar and Radar. We show that by (1) enforcing output consistency between a Teacher network and a Student network and by (2) introducing missing modalities (strong augmentations) during training, our learned model breaks away from the error-free sensor assumption. This consistency enforcement enables the Student model to handle missing data properly and improve the Teacher model by updating it with the Student model's exponential moving average. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed learning framework for multi-modal detection is able to better handle missing sensor data during inference. Furthermore, our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance (5% gain) on the Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset under various evaluation settings.},

  abstract={Traditional knowledge distillation adopts a two-stage training process in which a teacher model is pre-trained and then transfers the knowledge to a compact student model. To overcome the limitation, online knowledge distillation is proposed to perform one-stage distillation when the teacher is unavailable. Recent researches on online knowledge distillation mainly focus on the design of the distillation objective, including attention or gate mechanism. Instead, in this work, we focus on the design of the global architecture and propose Tree-Structured Auxiliary online knowledge distillation (TSA), which adds more parallel peers for layers close to the output hierarchically to strengthen the effect of knowledge distillation. Different branches construct different views of the inputs, which can be the source of the knowledge. The hierarchical structure implies that the knowledge transfers from general to task-specific with the growth of the layers. Extensive experiments on 3 computer vision and 4 natural language processing datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without bells and whistles. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of online knowledge distillation for machine translation tasks.11Code is available at https://github.com/Linwenye/Tree-Supervised.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation is a technique that effectively trains a lightweight model with strong generalization ability under the supervision of a powerful teacher model. However, a well-trained teacher model is really time-consuming. Therefore, online knowledge distillation emerged, which uses the aggregated results of multiple student models to help each student model to converge. But existing online distillation methods have several drawbacks, such as unavailable teacher models and the lack of diversity among student models. These hinder the further improvement of network performance. In this work, we propose a new online knowledge distillation technique that trains diverse architecture auxiliary peers to enhance the final effect of knowledge distillation. We propose a Multi-Architecture Peers (MAP) mechanism, which enhances student models to learn diverse features and delivers a powerful ensemble result. Furthermore, we introduce a Feature Learning Module (FLM) that efficiently learns rich semantic information by combing feature maps generated from the last block of student models and generates precise weights for each student model. The experimental results on three image classification datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN show that our method trains diverse student models and achieves much better results than alternative methods.},

  abstract={Predicting gait trajectories from electroencephalography (EEG) is useful for lower limb rehabilitation. The temporal dynamics of EEG pertaining to individual subjects while they are walking require a personalized treatment inside the deep neural network. Also, the EEG data collected from different sessions or days may exhibit varied distributions, further hindering the model generality. Therefore, we propose the Multi-model ATtention Network (MATN) to address these issues. MATN exploits the self-attention mechanism on the spatio-temporal EEG encoding to learn the subject-specific temporal dynamics. To adapt to varied data distributions, MATN employs knowledge distillation, which includes a teacher and student model. The latter is supervised by the intermediate feature maps from the trained teacher and the labels. Experiments of the regression of bilateral joint angles on the legs (hip, knee, and ankle) are carried out using the MoBI dataset in a subject-specific manner. Our MATN achieves more than 18% improvement on the Pearson's correlation coefficient compared to five other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Super-resolution (SR) methods are used to reconstruct details in images to obtain an improved resolution. Recently, SR methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become seminal due to their effectiveness in generating textures. However, a common problem is the presence of unpleasant artifacts. In this paper, an edge-guided SR neural network (Edge-SRN) is proposed by introducing a plug-in edge detection module and incorporating a new edge loss, which increases the reconstruction accuracy and reduces artifacts. We also use the Edge-SRN as a teacher network to a knowledge distillation framework for training a lightweight student SR model. The student model learned from Edge-SRN outperforms its counterparts learned from GAN-based teachers or from the ground-truth HR images in both reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality, which indicates the ability of reconstructing realistic textures can be transferred well from Edge-SRN to a small model. Extensive experiments on diverse criteria show the promising performance of our method compared with several state-of-the-art SR methods in the qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

  abstract={In this paper, we design a resource management scheme to support stateful applications, which will be prevalent in sixth generation (6G) networks. Different from stateless applications, stateful applications require context data while executing computing tasks from user terminals (UTs). Using a multi-tier computing paradigm with servers deployed at the core network, gateways, and base stations to support stateful applications, we aim to optimize long-term resource reservation by jointly minimizing the usage of computing, storage, and communication resources and the cost of reconfiguring resource reservation. The coupling among different resources and the impact of UT mobility create challenges in resource management. To address the challenges, we develop digital twin (DT) empowered network planning with two elements, i.e., multi-resource reservation and resource reservation reconfiguration. First, DTs are designed for collecting UT status data, based on which UTs are grouped according to their mobility patterns. Second, an algorithm is proposed to customize resource reservation for different groups to satisfy their different resource demands. Last, a Meta-learning-based approach is developed to reconfigure resource reservation for balancing the network resource usage and the reconfiguration cost. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DT-empowered network planning outperforms benchmark frameworks by using less resources and incurring lower reconfiguration costs.},

A digital twin assists the decision-making process by providing a virtual representation of a complex system. This paper presents an application of digital twin modeling for a data center in an academic institute. The building information modeling (BIM) has been applied to represent the data center. The sensing data (i.e., temperature, humidity, energy consumption, and computing resource utilization) in the data center are collected using the network of IoT. These sensing data are visualized together with the data center model. Then, the long short-term memory (LSTM) technique is applied to predict the future room temperature. The real-time data sensing of the data center facilitates the data center operator to monitor incidents in the data center.},

  pages={426-431},
  abstract={Current sewage pipeline inspection researches focus on locating defects, with only a few studies addressing the crack fine-grained classification task. However, in engineering applications, such as Pipeline Assessment Certification Program (PACP), subcategory coding of cacks is required. Therefore, this paper studies the fine-grained classification of pipeline cracks. Algorithms based on deep learning have been widely used in the field of sewage pipeline inspection, but these models have a large number of parameters and are computationally time-consuming. Edge or embedded devices with weak GPUs cannot accept the time and storage costs of these large models. To solve the above problems, this paper introduces knowledge distillation (KD) which is one of the mainstream model compression methods. We select the large-scale network Resnet50 as the teacher model and design a lightweight network Combined MobileNetV2 & Inception (CMI) for crack detection as the student model. High-temperature distillation allows the student model to obtain dark knowledge from the pre-trained, well-performing teacher model, which is combined with ground truth (GT) for training. Experiments show that KD is effective. By adjusting the KD hyperparameters, the classification accuracy of the student model is improved by 1.41%, and the F1-score is improved by 1.12%. This demonstrates the robustness of knowledge distillation to improve the performance of small models, laying the foundation for future deployment on multi-sensor automatic detection robots.},

  abstract={Reinforced concrete buildings have proven the need to monitor the concrete and steel parts over time. The topic of structural monitoring of a building is becoming more topical with time, and many buildings from the 1960s and 1970s are under observation. The current challenge is to monitor structures effectively and continuously, applying the meaning of preventive maintenance, a concept well developed in engineering disciplines. New technologies allow us to assess the impact of time, wear, and tear, which in the long term can challenge the safety of buildings by monitoring the natural vibrations of a building. However, traditional monitoring systems in the civil infrastructure sector have always been expensive and undervalued. Therefore, borrowing innovations from computer science, a sensor system based on the new paradigms of the Internet of Things (IoT) was developed to provide a valuable alternative to proven vibration monitoring systems. The proposed system consists of a microprocessor (Raspberry Pi) and a low-cost accelerometer for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), this type of lower costs sensor allows for investment in the safety of structures. The architecture of the monitoring system and the visualization of the vibrational model and its operation mechanism are presented. The performance of the monitoring system and the data collected are then integrated with Deep Learning techniques to obtain possible future scenarios and forecasts practically to perform tests that are as close as possible to reality and thus be able to act with the necessary maintenance to prevent undesired structural effects.},

In this paper, a 3D scanning model of the realistic workspace is utilized as its digital twin model, instead of a CAD model. The camera can be quickly calibrated with the digital twin by selecting a small number of paired 2D and 3D matching points. The pixel coordinate of human feet detected by the deep learning algorithm is mapped into the digital twin, and the human position is updated dynamically. A typical application of virtual electronic fence is developed based on the human localization results. The experimental results show that the calibration method is fast and effective, and the performance of human localization can meet the requirements of product management and safety monitoring.},

Then, in order to build a stacking integrated model of wind power, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on time domain are selected as primary learners, and a stable Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm is used as a secondary learner. Finally, the ablation and comparative experiments are conducted according to the measured data of a wind farm in China.

The Rinascimento III neighbourhood in Rome is the focus of the case study. It has 16 eight-story buildings with 216 apartments that are powered by renewable energy for 70% of the time. Because the complex has dynamic analytic algorithms built in, many different energy-efficient intervention scenarios can be tested to make sure the real comfort and temperature levels of the complex are kept. At the same time, a reliable IT infrastructure based on advanced computing paradigms that can deliver data is being designed and put into place. To meet NZEB criteria, a method was created to analyse the efficiency and effectiveness of integrated systems for producing renewable energy from solar energy. This is needed to raise the threshold of self-produced energy (near zero energy buildings).},

  abstract={The lightweight model has played an important role in the remote sensing (RS) realm. The existing researchers have proposed many models with lightweight structures, but their performance still has a gap compared with the deep model. A promising approach to optimize the lightweight model is knowledge distillation (KD), which can be viewed as knowledge transfer from the teacher model. However, the existing KD approaches have some issues. On one hand, offline distillation methods usually ignore the interactive learning between the student model and the teacher model. On the other hand, knowledge transfer does not consider instance property. This offline distillation strategy without property perception may not suitable for multiscale, diverse, and complex RS instances and results in a suboptimum training status. In this article, we propose a dynamic interactive learning (DIL) framework for optimizing RS lightweight detectors. First, we propose an instance interaction learning module. It calculates the value of every instance in the batch of the teacher and student prediction by each model’s real-time state and instance property. Then according to the DIL thought, we facilitate the low-quality instance to learn from the high-quality one whether it is from the teacher or student model. Moreover, we also propose the instance property perception (IPP) strategy that weighs the distillation knowledge of instances according to their feature, category, and location property. In the proposed DIL framework, both the teacher and student models are trained together and it is cost-free in the testing phase. Extensive experiments on three RS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the DIL.},

  abstract={We propose a non-iterative method to optimize pseudo-labeling thresholds for learning object detection from a collection of low-cost datasets, each of which is annotated for only a subset of all the object classes. A popular approach to this problem is first to train teacher models and then to use their confident predictions as pseudo ground-truth labels when training a student model. To obtain the best result, however, thresholds for prediction confidence must be adjusted. This process typically involves iterative search and repeated training of student models and is time-consuming. Therefore, we develop a method to optimize the thresholds without iterative optimization by maximizing the Fβ-score on a validation dataset, which measures the quality of pseudo labels and can be measured without training a student model. We experimentally demonstrate that our proposed method achieves an mAP comparable to that of grid search on the COCO and VOC datasets.},

In this work, we propose a novel method, namely Pyramid Knowledge Distillation (PKD) for efficient human pose estimation. Specifically, PKD composes of Pyramid Structured Map Distillation (PSMD) and Pyramid Feature Map Distillation (PFMD). In PSMD, we formulate a structured map encoding robust interjoint correlation. Based on structured map, the spatial dependencies between keypoints can be better transferred from a cumbersome teacher network to a compact student model. To further promote the efficiency of student, PFMD is used to distill rich local and global features from teacher. Experiments demonstrate that PKD achieves an optimal trade-off between cost and accuracy on COCO and MPII benchmarks, even with a much faster inference speed.},

  abstract={Existing methods for deepfake face forgery detection have already achieved tremendous progress in well-controlled laboratory conditions. However, under wild scenarios where the training and testing forgeries are synthesized by different algorithms and when labeled data are insufficient, the performance always drops greatly. In this work, we present a Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning and Knowledge Distillation-based framework (SCL-KD) for deepfake detection to reduce the aforementioned performance gap. Our proposed framework contains three stages: self-supervised pre-training, supervised training, and knowledge distillation. Specifically, a feature encoder is firstly trained in a self-supervised manner with a large number of unlabeled samples through a momentum contrastive mechanism. Secondly, a fully-connected classifier on top of the feature encoder is trained in a supervised manner with a small amount of labeled samples to build a teacher model. Finally, a compact student model is trained with the help of the teacher model using knowledge distillation, in order to avoid overfitting to labeled data and have better generalizability on mismatched datasets. Evaluations on several benchmark datasets corroborate the good performance of our approach in cross-dataset situations and few labeled data scenarios. It reveals the potential of our proposed method for real-world deepfake detection.},

Learning dynamic net-work behaviors at the flow granularity is a core element for realizing DTN with accurate network modelling. However, it is challenging due to the complexity of network architectures and the proliferation of emerging network applications. In this paper, we devise a Packet-Action Sequence Model to represent all possible packets behaviors in a unified way. Besides, we propose a novel and effective algorithm to assess whether the behavior pattern is time dependent or independent by using the temporal characteristics of packets in a network flow, so as to learn the key factors of packets that contribute to network behaviors. Based on two typical scenarios, i.e., packet caching and routing, the experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm can identify network behavior patterns and learn key factors affecting the behaviors with over 99 % accuracy.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={000063-000068},
  abstract={Modern robot applications often rely on visual information to perform manipulation tasks in semi-structured environments. A common requirement for such systems is to detect objects in the scene and predict their pose either for building a map, for navigation, or for manipulation purposes. Predicting segmentation masks for the objects is usually helpful for accurate object localization. In robotic manipulation however, the objects of interest can often have complicated geometries or there can be several objects in the scene simultaneously. This makes the manual annotation of an object segmentation dataset especially challenging. In this paper, an automated annotation procedure for object segmentation datasets is presented. Our method uses an industrial robot arm and a camera mounted to the robot’s end effector to collect a set of images showing a scene from multiple viewpoints. Assuming that the end effector transformation and scene geometry are known with respect to the robot’s base frame, the object masks can be computed to each image using the projection model of the camera. Through a real-world implementation of the method, our study demonstrates the accuracy of our automated annotation including a genetic algorithm-based optimization of the camera intrinsic parameters and the transformation between the robot’s flange and the camera frame. Our results suggest, that the proposed automated dataset annotation can be a good alternative to manual labeling. The presented approach introduces a novel application of the digital twin paradigm extending the concept to the field of machine learning dataset generation.},

  abstract={Existing distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) solutions cannot handle highly aggregated data rates; thus, they are unsuitable for Internet service provider (ISP) core networks. This article proposes a digital twin-enabled intelligent DDoS detection mechanism using an online learning method for autonomous systems. Our contributions are three-fold: we first design a DDoS detection architecture based on the digital twin for ISP core networks. We implemented a Yet Another Next Generation (YANG) model and an automated feature selection (AutoFS) module to handle core network data. We used an online learning approach to update the model instantly and efficiently, improve the learning model quickly, and ensure accurate predictions. Finally, we reveal that our proposed solution successfully detects DDoS attacks and updates the feature selection method and learning model with a true classification rate of ninety-seven percent. Our proposed solution can estimate the attack within approximately fifteen minutes after the DDoS attack starts.},

  abstract={With the rise of Industry 4.0, businesses are increasingly turning to Machine Learning to leverage data for improving quality and productivity. However, one open challenge when embracing Machine Learning in this context is the integration of cloud infrastructures, as well as the heterogeneity of data, interfaces, and protocols in the production environment. To address this, we are developing a framework that aims to simplify the adoption of Machine Learning techniques for heterogeneous industrial automation systems. One of the core features of this framework is the ability to handle data about production devices – a scenario that is naturally suited to the use of Asset Administration Shells. However, the implementation of a system that uses Asset Administration Shells comes with its own set of challenges, such as the abstraction of details from users and the representation of device topologies. Thus, this paper introduces the concepts and implementation of a Metadata Manager component in the aforementioned framework that uses Asset Administration Shells as its basis. We further examine the Metadata Manager’s current structure with unit testing, derive planned extensions, and discuss future directions from the Industry 4.0 perspective.},

  abstract={Nowadays, the automation industry is undergoing many changes, manufactures must react to fast changing market demands and more individual customer requirements. Recept-based, Service-Oriented Architectures enable the efficient adaption of production processes to new operating conditions. However, to ensure production performance, service-oriented production should also be complemented by adequate scheduling approaches to guarantee critical performance factors. We present a Digital Twin-based approach that performs integrated process planning and scheduling for service-based production. For our approach, we have identified a common set of input data required for integrated process planning and scheduling. We use Deep-Q-Network, which is a deep Reinforcement Learning method, to derive near optimal schedules for production conditions described in Digital Twins. If an unforseen event happens during the production, our approach is able to adapt current schedules to the changed operating conditions. The case study shows that our approach is able to derive near optimal schedules for customized products and adapt its currents schedules for new orders with different production goals.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Since the introduction of the term Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in 2006, they came to a long way. CPS are now autonomous and networked systems of systems with state-space exceeding the capabilities of conventional risk analysis methods. Model-based fault injection methods allow assessment of a system’s fault tolerance not only during its design phase but also in the course of operation. This allows the evaluation of updates and new modules before deploying such changes to a real system. Such operational model-based fault injection on a system’s digital twin can ensure continuous safety throughout all system life cycles.Modern risk analysis tools and Machine Learning-based safety methods require vast amounts of representative input and training data. Such methods not only will require mountains of erroneous time-series data from a myriad of operational cycles, but also corresponding fault parameter labels. As the state space of the system component explodes in complexity, it becomes problematic to cover all possible component fault combinations. As such, only those faults that could lead to potential failures or increased risk scenarios are of interest for automated safety assessment methodologies. It is clear that an intelligent and effective model-based fault injection method is required for the operational safety assessment of industrial CPS.Recently we introduced a new model-based fault injection method implemented as a highly customizable Simulink block called FIBlock. It supports the model-based injection of typical faults of CPS components such as sensors, software, computing, and network hardware. In this paper, we proposed a Deep Learning-based approach for model-based fault injection called FIDGET. It extends the FIBlock with Deep Reinforcement Learning capabilities. We employed a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to train the Reinforcement Learning agent to per-form the automated search of fault parameters that yield the biggest system response. It allows automatic generation of labeled training data for further use in risk analysis tools or to train fault classifiers. The generated training data consists of errors that lead to the biggest response (i.e., disturbance) of the system.},

  abstract={Currently, there are no commercial software systems to support the achievement of predefined surface roughness for newly machined parts. Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) programmers and machine operators rely on their experience to find the best trade-off between time and quality optimization.This paper presents a novel concept for predicting surface roughness based on real-time machining data, planning data, and quality measurements. By linking the data points of all the different sources to the respective manufacturing feature, like drilling or face milling, the data cleaning process is sped up significantly facilitating queries of machine learning applications.On the one hand, the relations derived from that machine learning model, e.g. a random forest, are integrated into a CAM planning software for parameter evaluation and automatic tool path optimization. On the other hand, the proposed surface roughness prediction algorithm is used in a live simulation to give machine operators immediate visual feedback on the produced finish to enhance precise feed rate adaption. Hence, a data-driven decision support system is to be developed which supports both inexperienced and experienced personnel at the planning and execution phase within the product life cycle.},

  abstract={Recently, smart system integration was identified as a key competence for optimizing machines and robots. However, when one wants to ’tune’ the entire production process a step further is necessary. We should evaluate performance indicators (e.g. energy and material consumption) over the whole machine life cycle in order to align the production with circular economy principles. To reach that target MBSE (model-based system engineering) should be covered by advanced digital twin approaches which allow continuous monitoring of machine performance, predict the failures and maintenance. Moreover, artificial intelligence and machine learning must be used to process big data sets gathered from the production lines. This paper identifies a common set of technologies and building blocks suitable to solve above mentioned problems for a large variety of industrial domains (semiconductor production, health-care robotics, CNC1 machining, high-speed packaging and others). It presents the first results of the large-scale IMOCO4.E2 project and shows the pathways for application of the technology on specific machines (so-called pilots).

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Industrial mobile robots increasingly operate in dynamic and complex environments, resulting in risks that arise from the situation. Consequently, mobile robots need knowledge about the situative risk to make responsible decisions, e.g., when planning a trajectory. In this paper, the authors present a new approach to evaluate these situative risks at runtime. To compute the situative risk, the proposed approach uses multi-agent adversarial reinforcement learning. Unlike the usual approach that uses the self-play mechanism to harden the agents against disturbances, the approach directly uses the self-play to determine the confidence that the system can handle the current situation. Based on the evaluation of the strength of the perceived perturbations, the robot’s digital twin calibrates the action space of the adversarial agents. In this way, the adversarial agents represent the disturbances that are likely to occur. From the simulation results of the competing agents, the digital twin infers the confidence with which the system can handle the situation. In the event that the system cannot handle the situation and crashes in the simulation, the digital twin calculates the probability that the simulated scenario will occur in reality. To calculate this probability, the authors propose the method of game-theoretic event trees. Combining the probability of an accident scenario with the damage caused by the simulated hazard, the results of situative risk are obtained. The approach is qualitatively evaluated using a case study. In this case study, a industrial mobile robot called Robotino is considered that connects workstations in a matrix production system. The case study shows that the approach is promising.},

The early development of this technique is exploiting the intermediate output of a deep learning model and utilizing it to optimize a targeted image. However, this technique needs some time to finish the process. An approach called knowledge distillation is widely used to optimize deep learning models so the speed of the model can be increased. Commonly, this technique is applied in a supervised task by providing a soft label as a target label for the student model. In this paper, a method is proposed to enable knowledge distillation happened in style transfer tasks. It is found this method is effective enough to make the style transfer process faster and give good results. In this paper also some discussion has been elaborated regarding the condition that is adequate to produce a good student model for style transfer tasks using knowledge distillation.},

  pages={112975-112988},
  abstract={Modern power systems have been expanding significantly including the integration of high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems, bringing a tremendous computational challenge to transient stability simulation for dynamic security assessment (DSA). In this work, a practical method for energy control center with the machine learning (ML) based synchronous generator model (SGM) and dynamic equivalent model (DEM) is proposed to reduce the computational burden of the traditional transient stability (TS) simulation. The proposed ML-based models are deployed on the field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for faster-than-real-time (FTRT) digital twin hardware emulation of the real power system. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) algorithm is adopted to train the SGM and DEM, where the training and testing datasets are obtained from the off-line simulation tool DSAToolsTM/TSAT®. A test system containing 15 ACTIVSg 500-bus systems interconnected by a 15-terminal DC grid is established for validating the accuracy of the proposed FTRT digital twin emulation platform. Due to the complexity of emulating large-scale AC-DC grid, multiple FPGA boards are applied, and a proper interface strategy is also proposed for data synchronization. As a result, the efficacy of the hardware emulation is demonstrated by two case studies, where an FTRT ratio of more than 684 is achieved by applying the GRU-SGM, while it reaches over 208 times for hybrid computational-ML based digital twin of AC-DC grid.},

  abstract={Recently Digital Twin (DT) has attracted much attention from researchers due to its capacity of system monitoring and health management to improve the reliability and availability of systems. This emerging technology has been considered a promising solution for various sectors to enhance the sustainability of business development. In general, DT relies on the living models for simulating system behaviors to monitor the systems or assets in production. Such models could be either mathematical/physics-based or data-driven, which are able to explain, predict, and describe system behaviors timely and accurately. Therefore, the machine learning-enabled modeling technology has become a powerful tool to develop such data-driven living models. However, data-driven models developed with supervised learning techniques carry a fatal deficiency: once the operational environments are changed, the model may hardly work well or even becomes useless due to the distribution shift between the training data and the new dataset. This paper attempts to address this issue by proposing to apply transfer learning techniques to develop lifetime robust living models for real-world DT systems. This paper presents a framework for developing lifetime data-driven living models. A case study, railway digital twin from our on-going research project along with the preliminary results, will be presented to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed modeling framework for digital twin.},

  abstract={One of the challenges in designing and operating systems composed of interacting components is validating that the emergent behavior of the system does not cause one or more components to migrate, over time, into a hazardous operating state. Many modern airline accidents can be characterized as Interaction Accidents – no component failed, but the interaction of components resulted in a hazardous state.Due to the dependence of time, emergent behavior cannot be evaluated by analysis of the design. In theory it can be evaluated by Digital-Twin agent-based simulations. However, the running these simulations to uncover rare event emergent hazardous states is prohibitive due to: (1) the combinatorics of initial states of each of the components, and the (2) combinatorics of the time dimension (i.e. small variations in timing can result in very different outcomes). Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLNN) have shown promise to capture the underlying combinatoric behavior as well as compress the time dimension.This paper demonstrates the application of DLNN to identify emergent behavior from components with hybrid moded/continuous behavior that plays out over time. DLNNs were trained and tested for three systems with increasing behavioral complexity. The DLNNs accurately were able to represent the time dependent behavior for which they were trained/tested. The DLNNs were also able to learn and predict emergent behavior for behaviors that were not included in the training/testing data (up to 63% of the missing cases). The implications of these results are discussed.},

It is therefore necessary for libraries to upgrade the services they provide to keep in line with the technological trends and be a part of this virtual revolution. We believe that the design and development of a Virtual Reality (VR) library can be the community and knowledge hub the society needs. In this paper we go through the process of creating a digital twin of the Limassol Municipal University Library, a landmark for the city of Limassol, by using photogrammetry and 3D modelling. By integrating the concept of digital twin, we developed a 3D platform where users have the perception that they are exhibiting the actual library. To do so, we conducted a perceptual study to understand the current usage of physical libraries, examine the users' experience in VR, and identify the requirements and expectations in the development of a virtual library counterpart. Following the suggestions and observations of our user study, we implemented five common case scenarios that demonstrate a potential use of a virtual library.},

  abstract={Online learning plays an increasingly important role in the field of education for its advantages of solid flexibility, openness, and richness. However, it also faces problems such as information explosion and resource overload, which makes it difficult for learners to obtain personalized learning resources timely and accurately and to complete learning efficiently. Learning resource recommendation is one of the critical countermeasures to solve the above problem. The current recommendation of learning resources is mainly based on the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation method and content-based recommendation method, which do not fully consider learners' characteristics resulting in unsatisfactory effects. A collaborative filtering recommendation method for online learning resources is proposed based on a traditional collaborative filtering algorithm and combined with research in the learner modeling community. This method incorporates learners' characteristics and learning behaviors into recommendation calculations making the recommended learning resources better match learners' individual needs. This study implemented the proposed method based on an influential online teachers' professional development community in China. The results show that the performance of recommendation is significantly higher than the traditional recommendation method.},

  abstract={Advanced manufacturing systems increasingly rely on intelligent algorithms to discriminate, model and predict system behaviours that lead to increased productivity. Edge intelligence allows the industrial systems to collect, compute and act based on process data while reducing the latency and cost associated to an hierarchical control system in which complex decisions are generated in the upper layers of the automation hierarchy. Greater local computing capabilities allow the online operation of such algorithms while accounting for increased performance requirements and lower sampling periods of the control loops. In this work we present the concept of a cognitive robotic cell that collects, stores and processes data in situ for enabling the control of a robotic arm in a production setting. The main features that characterise the robotic cell are embedded computing, open interfaces, and standards-based industrial communication with hardware peripherals and digital twin models for validation. An application of part classification is presented that uses the YOLOv4 image processing algorithm for real-time and online assessment that guides the control of an ABB IRB120C robotic arm. Results illustrate the feasibility and robustness of the approach in a real application. Quantitative evaluation underlines the performance of the implemented system.},

  pages={210-215},
  abstract={Vision transformers (ViTs) have made remarkable achievements in various computer vision applications such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. Since the self-attention mechanism introduced by itself can model the relationship between all pixels of the input image, the performance of the ViTs model is significantly improved compared to the traditional CNN network. However, their storage, runtime memory and computing requirements hinder their deployment on edge devices. This paper proposes a ViT pruning method with knowledge distillation, which can prune the ViT model and avoid the performance loss of the model after pruning. Based on the idea that knowledge distillation can make the student model improve the performance of the model by learning the unique knowledge of the teacher model, the convolution neural network (CNN) which has the unique ability of parameter sharing and local receptive field is used as a teacher model to guide the training of the ViT model and enable the ViT model to obtain the same ability. In addition, some important parts may be cut during pruning, resulting in irreversible loss of model performance. To solve this problem, this paper designs the importance score learning module to guide the pruning work, and determines that the pruning work removes the unimportant parts of the model. Finally, this paper compares the pruned model with other methods in terms of accuracy, Floating Point Operations(FLOPs) and model parameters on ImageNet-1k.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of new generation technologies, the digital twin (DT) has become a core focus for the solution of assembly process in the fourth industrial evolution. So, based on DT, aiming at the unobservable, unpredictable, and uncontrollable problems during the assembly process of complex products like large solid rocket engines, we propose a digital twin-driven framework for online prediction and control method toward assembly quality for complex products. Under this framework, firstly, the high-fidelity modeling method is presented involving 3D CAD and assembly quality model based on point cloud towards unobservable problems. Secondly, online deviation traceability and quality prediction are introduced to aim at unpredictable problems. Thirdly, intelligent regulation and control mechanism for assembly quality based on DT, AR, deep learning, etc. is developed for uncontrollable problems in assembly process. Finally, the large rocket engine nozzle is taken as a case to verify the entire framework and method effectiveness.},

  abstract={In existing semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches, the contributions of labeled and unlabeled data points to the training objective are expressed as two separated terms for the respective sets. A single weight specifies how much the unlabeled samples contribute to the overall loss and is carefully scaled in the course of the training. In this work, we propose a SSL framework in which the contribution of each unlabeled sample is individually scaled based on the confidence generated by a teacher model. We demonstrate that our scaling mechanism enables the student model to efficiently learn from heavily interpolated and augmented samples and achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract={A dynamic adversarial adaptive bearing fault diagnosis method driven by a combination of simulation and data is proposed to solve the problem of low diagnostic accuracy of rolling bearings due to the scarcity of fault data samples and complex service conditions in real industrial scenarios. Firstly, a four-degree-of-freedom dynamics simulation model was proposed for the rapid generation of bearing fault characteristics with a well-defined time-frequency domain. Subsequently, the commonalities and differences between the measured data distribution and the dynamics simulation signal were explored. Finally, a dynamic adversarial adaptive network that can extract invariant features in the hidden domain and automatically align the distribution of data in the source domain of the simulation and the data to be diagnosed in the target domain is developed. A rolling bearing fault diagnosis simulation experiment was designed, which used the dynamic model to generate the simulated signal with label information and the measured signal without label information to train the neural network. The classification and recognition of unlabeled samples are completed. The results show that the simulated signals contain information on the characteristics of bearing faults, which can characterise real bearing data. Moreover, the proposed dynamic adversarial adaptive network can achieve more accurate fault diagnosis of bearings.},

This work in progress presents a digital revision of this laboratory experiment. It consists of two pedagogically and technically flexible combinable parts. Both parts are inter-institutionally collaborative and are available as a package of executable files.In the first part, an extraction column is operated as a digital twin in virtual reality (VR) usable on home PCs with or without VR goggles. The flow diagram and real laboratory plant setup can be compared, individual plant elements controlled, and alternative control concepts evaluated.

  abstract={The European interconnected grid is an association of all transmission system operators from Europe and enables a stable grid frequency and high security of supply. Due to the increasing share of volatile, decentralised renewable energies and the promotion of electromobility, the grid operators of the transmission and distribution grids are facing new challenges among others in the operational management of the electrical grid. To be able to train future engineers and students for this challenging grid operation and to train employees of grid operators, practical, realistic experience is essential in addition to theoretical knowledge. Since incorrect switching operations on the real grid can have serious consequences, it is necessary to set up a simulation of a grid control station for this purpose. Current service providers train employees in special simulators. However, the use of these simulators is strictly limited to fixed dates. In addition, the participation of prospective engineers as students is often not accessible due to the high costs involved in theses training sessions. Therefore, this paper describes a grid control station in virtual reality. Real grids are represented as a digital twin and are integrated into the virtual reality control station. However, the coupling of these two components currently exists only as a concept but will be realised soon. The participants immerse into the virtual grid control station, perform switching actions in different scenarios, and experience the consequences of their actions to increase their practical knowledge in grid operations to face the future grid challenges. The VR grid control station is to be offered as an education opportunity in the field of power engineering at Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences.},

  abstract={The lack of digitization of asset inventories managed by an educational institution, generates that maintenance management is affected; since, technologies are currently very advanced and propose better solutions for the control of the maintenance of educational infrastructures, one of them is the “digital twin” that has much potential to contribute concerning the traditional. However, the education sectors do not update their asset management processes, since being a very new digital tool takes time and investment for its optimal implementation, which causes a lack of quantitative evidence on the application of digital methods and thus generates a little contribution to the implementation or feasibility of the same. That is why using a methodology called “facility management ”, which aims to use an innovative technology “digital twin” and thus generate a big change in the maintenance control of educational assets, to achieve this, it is necessary to compare a traditional inventory with a digital inventory using a digital twin, where maintenance management will be the common point. Given this, we used methodologies such as descriptive analysis where the traditional inventory is analyzed and the application of a digital inventory with the digital twin, there will also be the judgment of experts on the use of the digital twin, then a SWOT analysis and finally a comparative analysis of the inventories to demonstrate the viability.},

  abstract={Knowledge Distillation (KD) is well known as one of the methods of compressing deep learning models. It aims to train the student model so that the student model (compressed model) can imitate the output of the teacher model (original model). However, the output of the teacher model alone may not be sufficient to train the student model. To compensate for this, we propose a method called Intermediate-State Knowledge Distillation (ISKD). Unlike most of the knowledge distillation studies that have been conducted for computer vision tasks, the proposed method is applied to a time series model that predicts the life of a battery using NASA AMES dataset. As a result, our method reduced the error level of battery End-of-Life (EOL) cycle by up to 1.04% compared to the conventional distillation method. In addition, the number of parameters could be reduced and at the same time, there was an advantage in terms of latency.},

  pages={124685-124696},
  abstract={Electric Vehicles (EVs) reliance on batteries, which currently have lower energy and power densities than liquid fuels and are prone to aging and performance degradation over time, restricts their mainstream adoption. With applications like electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage, effective management of lithium-ion batteries is a vital enabler for a low-carbon future. Monitoring the battery’s condition of health and charge over the lifetime of an EV is, therefore, a highly pertinent issue. Battery Management Systems (BMS) are used during the operation of EVs to monitor, estimate and control battery states to ensure that batteries can function effectively and safely. Additionally, the materials composition, system design, and operating circumstances substantially impact a battery’s usable life, making it more challenging to govern and maintain battery systems. This work proposes the structure of a battery digital twin-based battery for the electronic vehicle, which has the potential to enhance BMS situational awareness greatly and enable the optimal functioning of battery storage units. Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence (AI) present an opportunity and offer. In this paper, a Digital Twin (DT) is proposed as a solution to the difficulty of onboard computation for the incremental State Of Health (SOH) and State Of Charge (SOC) by using Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) model and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to predict the state estimate for the EV battery. The battery’s condition has been determined by using the EKF, which can provide vital information for maintenance. First, the battery’s usable life can be extended with an accurate estimate of the SOC to continue; then a learning-based prediction approach to gauge the battery’s health state is suggested in order to increase battery life. A SOC model is frequently retrained to depict the effects of aging, and a SOH model is often performed to foretell the reduction in the highest battery capacity. According to a result, DT models are useful for managing batteries, and full life cycle statistics are important for planning the battery’s upgrade path.},

Firstly, the digital power grid model is constructed based on the digital twin technology, and the operation mode of the digital twin power grid is introduced in detail. Then, the time convolution network (TCN) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) network are fused to design the GRU-TCN prediction model. The high-dimensional data features extracted by TCN are input into the GRU network for learning to enhance the model prediction performance. Finally, the GRU-TCN model is applied to the load forecasting of digital twin power grid, and the high-precision forecasting results are obtained. The experimental results based on the simulation platform show that the proposed method prediction results root mean square error is 28.428KW, and mean absolute percentage error values is 2.161%, which prediction effect is good.},

  abstract={In this paper, a hyperparameter tuning based Bayesian optimization of digital twins is carried out to diagnose various faults in grid connected inverters. As fault detection and diagnosis require very high precision, we channelize our efforts towards an online optimization of the digital twins, which, in turn, allows a flexible implementation with limited amount of data. As a result, the proposed framework not only becomes a practical solution for model versioning and deployment of digital twins design with limited data, but also allows integration of deep learning tools to improve the hyperparameter tuning capabilities. For classification performance assessment, we consider different fault cases in virtual synchronous generator (VSG) controlled grid-forming converters and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Our research outcomes reveal the increased accuracy and fidelity levels achieved by our digital twin design, overcoming the shortcomings of traditional hyperparameter tuning methods.},

  abstract={Due to the advancement of digital twin (DT) technology, Health 4.0 applications have become reality and starting to take roots. In this article, we focus on intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) which is a life-threatening emergency that needs immediate diagnosis and treatment. ICH is caused by bleeding inside the skull or brain. Radiologists typically examine computed tomography (CT) scans of the patients to determine the ICH and its subtype. But the manual assessment of the CT scan is a complex and time-consuming task. The existing pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models are state-of-the-art for ICH classification. However, they employ poor feature extraction techniques which hinder overall model performance. Furthermore, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality and use redundant and noisy features. The problem of imbalanced data is also crucial for achieving model generalization. This paper proposes a hybrid attention-based ResNet architecture for ICH detection and classification. An attention mechanism allows the model to focus on a specific region and extract relevant features. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction and redundant feature removal whereas deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) is used for resolving the class imbalance problem. The proposed model is evaluated using the dataset assembled during the Radiologist Society of North America (RSNA) ICH detection challenge 2019. The results show that our proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and F1-score. ICH classification achieved accuracies of 99.2%, 97.1%, 96.7%, 96.7% and 96.1%, for detecting epidural hemorrhage (EH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), subdural hemorrhage (SH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) subtypes respectively. The F1-score of 96.1% for EH subtype is also best when compared with the benchmark models.},

  abstract={Building modeling, specifically heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) load and equivalent energy storage calculations, represent a key focus for decarbonization of buildings and smart grid controls. Widely used white box models, due to their complexity, are too computationally intensive to be employed in high resolution distributed energy resources (DER) platforms without simulation time delays. In this paper, an ultra-fast one-minute resolution Hybrid Machine Learning Model (HMLM) is proposed as part of a novel procedure to replicate white box models as an alternative to wide spread experimental big data collection. Synthetic output data from experimentally calibrated EnergyPlus models for three existing smart homes managed by the Tennessee Valley Authority is used. The HMLM employs combined k-means clustering and multiple linear regression (MLR) models to predict minutely HVAC power with satisfactory nRMSE error of less than 10% across an entire year test set. An approach is provided to characterize HVAC systems through the newly proposed hybrid model as a generalized storage (GES) device suitable for DER control and event types in accordance with the Communication Technology Association (CTA) 2045 standard and Energy Star metrics such as “energy take”, currently developed by industry, to unify household appliance controls.},

  abstract={Deep reinforcement learning achieves super-human performances at the cost of millions of non-optimal interactions with environments. Ideally, a well trained deep reinforcement learning algorithm should be robust to unseen cases or unseen tasks with limited data. This paper proposes a new meta reinforcement learning algorithm with the Hebbian learning algorithm. According to the neuroscientific theory, Hebbian learning mimics the learning behaviours of the human brain. Neurons are activated repeatedly, and new neural networks are built with newly formed connections. Researchers have proved that compared with deep reinforcement learning, Hebbian learning can obtain the near-optimal solutions within short training iterations. In this paper, we use a teacher-student learning architecture. In the teacher model, the Hebbian learning model is trained with an evolutionary strategy while the student model is a deep reinforcement learning model trained with modified training procedures. Experiments prove that our proposed algorithm overwhelms the performances of the Hebbian learning algorithm and the original deep reinforcement learning vastly. Besides, with strong inductive biases introduced by learned knowledge from subtasks, the data efficiency of deep reinforcement learning is significantly boosted. Moreover, we set the target task and subtasks different primarily to prove the robustness of Hebbian learning as the teacher model. Experiments prove that this proposed meta reinforcement learning algorithm could boost data efficiency largely.},

  abstract={Demand flexibility management, often by means of Demand Response (DR), can significantly enhance the stability of the electric grid and reduce the investment cost for infrastructure upgrades in case of dynamic energy mix with renewable sources. However, uncertainty in the consumer response to the DR signals may disrupt this goal. In this paper, we deal with the optimal management of the flexibility offered by residential users under uncertainty. We develop a probabilistic user model to account for the uncertainty in the actual provision of the flexibility by a user in conjunction with incentives' offered thereto, which we subsequently introduce in the Demand Response (DR) targeting process. We consider a suitable optimization framework to enable flexibility maximization and budget minimization as separate single-objective expressions with the appropriate constraints. We define representative problems and solve them numerically for a wide range of user parameters, in order to illustrate the applicability and accuracy of our method, and to extract valuable insights. Finally, we develop techniques to resolve practical issues and to enable real-world implementation of the proposed scheme in pilot sites; namely, a mathematical expression to estimate the confidence intervals of the attained flexibility and a learning algorithm for extracting the individual user parameters according to their participation patterns.},

  abstract={Anomaly detection models for network flow based on machine learning have poor detection performance under extremely unbalanced training data conditions, and also have slow detection speed and large resource consumption when deploying on network edge devices. Embedding multi-teacher knowledge distillation (mKD) in anomaly detection can transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models to a single model. Inspired by this, we proposed a state-of-the-art model, mKDNAD, to improve detection performance. mKDNAD mine and integrate the knowledge of one-dimensional sequence and two-dimensional image implicit in network flow to improve the detection accuracy of small sample classes. The multi-teacher knowledge distillation method guides the train of the student model, thus speeding up the model’s detection speed and reducing the number of model parameters. Experiments in the CICIDS2017 dataset verify the improvements of our method in the detection speed and the detection accuracy in dealing with the small sample classes.},

We investigate different management objectives that include end-to-end delay bounds on service requests, throughput objectives, and service differentiation. These objectives are mapped onto reward functions that an RL agent learns to optimize, by executing control actions, namely, request routing and request blocking. We compute the control policies not on the testbed, but in a simulator, which speeds up the learning process by orders of magnitude. In our approach, the system model is learned on the testbed; it is then used to instantiate the simulator, which produces near-optimal control policies for various management objectives. The learned policies are then evaluated on the testbed using unseen load patterns.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-13},
  abstract={With the massive popularization of e-learning, collaborative learning via learning teams has become indispensable to enhancing the learning efficiency and learning quality of overall learners. The team leader usually plays a key role in collaborative learning. However, the existing research ignores the key characteristics of learners and constraints relevant to e-learners when identifying appropriate team leaders and compatible members. A novel collaborative optimization approach to learning team formation is proposed based on a refined learner model and the environments—classes, agents, roles, groups, and objects (E-CARGO) model. With the proposed approach, a learner is modeled by combining 5-D characteristics (i.e., cognitive ability, leadership, sociability, learning style, and personality) and three types of constraints (e.g., conflicts, genders, and the number of members), and an assessment mechanism is designed to measure the comprehensive abilities of learners for identifying an ideal team leader and selecting the team members for a team. By innovatively introducing the role-based collaboration theory and E-CARGO model, the leader-centered learning team formation problem is formalized as a collaborative optimization problem. The mathematical model and the constraint relations are established for this problem, which is solved based on the IBM CPLEX package. Finally, a case study and experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is efficient and feasible, in favor of improving the satisfaction degree of learners.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},

  abstract={This paper proposes to use a digital twin of a dynamical system directly for optimization-based control. It proposes an algorithm based on an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to solve optimization-based control problems, where the system dynamics is encoded in the digital twin. The UKF-based algorithm uses simulations of a digital twin directly to optimize the control policy and does not require gradients to be computed―making it suitable for differential-algebraic constraints, where gradients may be inaccessible. The proposed UKF-based algorithm does not require explicit knowledge of the internal model of the digital twin, nor the control map; that is, it is a purely simulation data-driven approach. The main advantage is that a high-precision simulation-oriented digital twin can approximate the physical dynamical system more accurately than an analytical control-oriented model and thus, can improve the performance of the controller. The digital twin-based optimal control approach is evaluated on two case studies. First, a pendulum on a cart is optimized to swing up and stabilize. Second, a crane controller is optimized to avoid oscillations of the load.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Over the last years, the engine calibration task has mostly been conducted based on the engineers’ knowledge. As a result, considering the complexity of modern engines, finding the most suitable configuration for each situation has become an impractical and expensive task. Apart from causing engines to be produced with inadequate calibration configuration, it can also decrease the lifespan of their components, degrading their efficiency. This paper proposes a machine learning-based digital twin model for pressure prediction in a fuel injection system, split into two steps. First, we extract statistical engine features based on a predefined time window to represent the engine behavior over time. Second, a digital twin implemented through a machine learning model is used to predict pressure levels in the fuel injection system. As a result, the predicted values can be used to assist the engine common rail system module in avoiding undesired engine states. Experiments performed on a new dataset, built over a real diesel-based engine, consisting of 208 features and over 1.3 million instances, have shown the feasibility of our proposal. The proposed scheme can predict in an advance time of 0.1 seconds the pressure levels for a fuel injection system with only 0.057 RMSE. Moreover, it increases its error rate by only 10.6% if a 0.5-second time advance is required.},

  abstract={The complete life cycle management of complex equipment is seen as critical to the smart transformation and upgrading of today’s industrial industry. In recent years, digital twin (DT) technology and machine learning (ML) have arisen as emerging technologies. Developing technologies like DT technology and ML in entire battery life cycle management may make each stage of the life cycle more predictable and proactive. We propose a hybrid DT model based on ML that can enhance the performance of an existing DT mathematical model formulated to simulate lithium-ion battery deterioration behavior using DT technology. Firstly, we develop a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based model to forecast the error term of battery capacity enumerated for each charge and discharge cycle from the existing DT model. In this work, we use 18,650 lithium-ion battery discharge data from NASA Ames’ prognostics data repository as our experimental data. The LSTM model is configured with Adam optimizer and the mean absolute error (MAE) loss function. The early stopping criterion is also employed as a regularization technique to overcome model overfitting. Secondly, we develop our proposed hybrid DT by integrating both the existing DT and the LSTM model. Thirdly, we formulate an empirical mathematical model, which allows us to better replicate behavior of battery degradation of any lithium-ion battery. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid DT in terms of the MAE metric. Compared with the existing model, our proposed model reduces the error of battery capacity during the entire degradation period by 68.42%.},

  abstract={Digital twin and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are considered key enablers for Industry 4.0 and sustainable intelligent manufacturing. The usage of digital twins in manufacturing processes leads to an enhancement in process understanding due to the continuous processing and evaluation of production data. Hence, when properly implemented, it empowers the ability to increase the agility, traceability, and resilience of production systems. Despite these merits, the scalability and fidelity of digital twins at the manufacturing field level are limited by heterogeneous data sources as well as modeling uncertainties, e.g., due to coarse approximation and imprecise parameter identification. This study proposes a novel approach to overcome these deficiencies by exploiting machine learning on aggregated data throughout the product development process. A procedure is established to contextualize metadata sources from the construction, planning, manufacturing, and quality stages into a quality feature-based digital thread. On this basis, a hybrid approach for quantifying modeling uncertainties across the model chain is developed by incorporating the production domain knowledge into AI techniques. As a result, the digital twin takes into account disturbances from the physical manufacturing environment and estimates the reliability of the modeled outcomes. An exemplary implementation of this concept is demonstrated by using a cutting-edge digital process twin for machining quality monitoring.},

  abstract={The Artificial Agent's ability to enhance knowledge incrementally for new data is challenging in class incremental learning because of catastrophic forgetting in which new classes make the trained model quickly forget old classes knowledge. Knowledge distilling techniques and keeping subset of data from the old classes have been proposed to revamp models to accommodate new classes. These techniques allow models to sustain their knowledge without forgetting everything they already know but somewhat alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem. In this study we propose class incremental learning using bi-distillation (CILBD) method that effectively learn not only the classes of the new data but also previously learned classes. The proposed architecture uses knowledge distillation in such a way that the student model directly learns knowledge from two teacher model and thus alleviate the forgetting of the old class. Our experiments on the iCIFAR-100 dataset showed that the proposed method is more accurate at classifying, forgets less, and works better than state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of modeling a printing-imaging channel built on a machine learning approach a.k.a. digital twin for anti-counterfeiting applications based on copy detection patterns (CDP). The digital twin is formulated on an information-theoretic framework called Turbo that uses variational approximations of mutual information developed for both encoder and decoder in two-directional information passage. The proposed model generalizes several state-of-the-art architectures such as adversarial autoencoder (AAE) [1], CycleGAN [2] and adversarial latent space auto-encoder (ALAE) [3]. This model can be applied to any type of printing and imaging and it only requires training data consisting of digital templates or artworks that are sent to a printing device and data acquired by an imaging device. Moreover, these data can be paired, unpaired or hybrid paired-unpaired which makes the proposed architecture very flexible and scalable to many practical setups. We demonstrate the impact of various architectural factors, metrics and discriminators on the overall system performance in the task of generation/prediction of printed CDP from their digital counterparts and vice versa. We also compare the proposed system with several state-of-the-art methods used for image-to-image translation applications. The code and extended results of the simulation are publicly available1.},

Combining immersive technologies like mixed reality with robotics education leads a promising path to broaden the access to fundamental knowledge of industrial robotics. As high demands are placed on teaching complex topics like coordinate transformation in six degrees of freedom, which is crucial to understand for operating a six-axes industrial robot, a more intuitive and easier access to robotics must be ensured. Based on this, the aim of this work is to contribute facilitating the use of a mixed reality based digital twin platform for robotics education. To this end, a combined system of desktop robotics and mixed reality is to be expanded and investigated for entry into robotics courses.

Meanwhile, advances in industrial control systems technology have enabled increasingly complex functionality to be deployed on or near so-called edge devices, such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).In this paper, we propose a methodology for training a machine learning model offline using data extracted from a digital twin, before converting the model for deployment on an edge device to perform anomaly detection. To examine the model’s suitability for anomaly detection, we execute several simulations of fault conditions. Results show that the model can successfully predict normal operations as well as identify faults and cyber-attacks.

  pages={103-106},
  abstract={Electrical cables within nuclear power plants (NPPs) are critical components required for power, control, and instrumentation systems which may be exposed to stressors, such as elevated temperatures and gamma radiation. Such stressors can lead to a reduction in the remaining useful life of electrical cables, jeopardizing the safety of NPP systems. To evaluate the effect of stressors on the degradation of electrical cables, electrical reflectometry methods are commonly employed. Frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) is a non-destructive electrical reflectometry method that uses transmission line theory to detect degradation or impedance changes within electrical cables. However, in most cases FDR is only applied to de-energized cables, limiting the application in NPPs as the cable system must be taken offline. In this work, we explore the development of an FDR digital twin to predict the degradation of an electrical cable exposed to elevated temperature, which is expected to reduce the need for offline FDR. A 3-conductor low-voltage electrical cable was selected for evaluation of the digital twin. The fully three-dimensional digital twin was developed in COMSOL using the radio frequency module. A cable length of 30-m and frequency bandwidth of 400 MHz was selected to mimic real-world application of FDR. Over a 1-m region, the permittivity of the insulation was varied by up to 20% to model thermal degradation. The results demonstrate accurate detection of the insulation damage region, supporting further investigation of the FDR digital twin using real-world data and machine learning for predictive damage estimation or remaining lifetime.},

  abstract={Obstacle detection is a fundamental capability of an autonomous maritime surface vessel (AMSV). State-of-the-art obstacle detection algorithms are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While CNNs provide higher detection accuracy and fast detection speed, they require enormous amounts of data for their training. In particular, the availability of domain-specific datasets is a challenge for obstacle detection. The difficulty in conducting onsite experiments limits the collection of maritime datasets. Owing to the logistic cost of conducting on-site operations, simulation tools provide a safe and cost-efficient alternative for data collection. In this work, we introduce SimuShips, a publicly available simulation-based dataset for maritime environments. Our dataset consists of 9471 high-resolution (1920x1080) images which include a wide range of obstacle types, atmospheric and illumination conditions along with occlusion, scale and visible proportion variations. We provide annotations in the form of bounding boxes. In addition, we conduct experiments with YOLOv5 to test the viability of simulation data. Our experiments indicate that the combination of real and simulated images improves the recall for all classes by 2.9%.},

  abstract={With the ever increasing demands of resource-hungry applications, computational tasks tend to be offloaded to edge servers for execution. However, most of the existing works on edge computing integrated with cloud computing ignore the additional computational resources of end devices and neighboring edge servers. Hierarchical task offloading allows more flexible distribution of computation loads among devices, edges, and the cloud hence further improving the quality of the computation experience. In this paper, a device-edge-cloud collaboration framework (DECHO) for hierarchical task offloading is developed, which learns to explore all available resources to improve offloading performance in a decentralized manner. Furthermore, an experimental prototype of DECHO is demonstrated. The experimental results present the task execution efficiency performance, which validates the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

  abstract={The Metaverse is an emerging technology to make virtual environments for users to benefit from a huge number of virtual services, while users experience immersive interactions with the real world. Digital twins, which are representatives of assets in this virtual world, play an important role to connect this environment to the actual world. Therefore, translating problematic assets, objects, and disease like cancers to this cyber world provide patients with this opportunity to benefit from its advantages. This study aims to conceptualize an approach to how machine learning (ML) can realize real-time and robust digital twins of cancers to be used in the Metaverse for diagnosis and treatment. While there are a large number of ML methods, which have advantages based on the various types of healthcare data, four classic ML techniques, including ML linear regression (ML LR), decision tree regression (DTR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Gradient Boosting Algorithm (GBA), have been employed to implement the main part of this approach in this research. Moreover, a comprehensive conceptual framework of the ML digital twinning method has been presented to illustrate the process of digital twining cancers with different medical data.},

  pages={897-902},
  abstract={The traditional unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, especially semantic segmentation, which requires high cost of pixel-wise annotations. However, the final performance of UDA method is still far behind that of supervised learning due to the lack of annotations. Researchers introduce the semi-supervised learning (SSL) and propose a more practical setting, semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA), that is, having labeled source domain data and a small number of labeled target domain data. To address the inter-domain gap, current researches focus on domain alignment by mixing annotated data from two domains, but we argue that adapting the target domain data distribution through model transfer is a better solution. In this paper, we propose a two-stage SSDA framework based on this assumption. Firstly, we adapt the model from the source domain to the labeled dataset in the target domain. To verify the assumption, we choose a basic transfer mode: finetuning. Then, to align the labeled subspace and the unlabeled subspace of the target domain, we choose teacher-student model with class-level data augmentation as the basis to realize online self-training. We also provide a deformation to solve overfitting on the target domain with a small number of annotated data. Extensive experiments on two synthetic-to-real benchmarks have demonstrated the correctness of our idea and the effectiveness of our method. In most SSDA scenarios, our approach can achieve supervised performance or even better.},

  abstract={Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful strategy for making a flexible task-oriented dialog agent, but it is weak in learning speed. Deep Dyna-Q augments the agent's experience to improve the learning efficiency by internally simulating the user's behavior. It uses a deep neural network (DNN) based learnable user model to predict user action, reward, and dialog termination from the dialog state and the agent's action. However, it still needs many agent-user interactions to train the user model. We propose a DNN-Rule hybrid user model for Dyna-Q, where the DNN only simulates the user action. Instead, a rule-based function infers the reward and the dialog termination. We also investigate the training with rollout to further enhance the learning efficiency. Experiments on a movie-ticket booking task demonstrate that our approach significantly improves learning efficiency.},

  abstract={In our contribution, we consider how the Digital Twin of the production system can be combined with Artificial Intelligence methods. The result of these considerations should be a hybrid production management system, which can be used for decision support as well as for self-control. On the one hand, the Digital Twin is providing information and simulation for the optimal decision-making to the decision support system (human interaction). On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence is taking over some elements and tasks with automatic control (independent of human interaction). If the result is out of tolerance or if a random sample of the result is audited, the decision support system is validating the Artificial Intelligence result for execution (by human interaction). The hybrid production management system is to be used to control production processes and generates learning effects. The extension by methods of Artificial Intelligence opens possibilities to process and to master certain tasks independently of human interaction. The presented approach should relieve and support decision makers in production. By performing various actions automatically and achieving partial auto-control, the reactivity of linked processes can increase. The provision of decisive information favors decision quality and time-effectiveness.},

Field and bibliographic studies allowed to determine that the digital twin should be based on a multi-agent system model for reasons of flexibility and modularity necessary in this constantly changing environment. The digital twin is intended to adapt to the organization but also to enhance it by including missing information flows. This paper presents the agent model chosen and inspired from reinforcement learning and how it allowed to identify these missing flows. The importance of interfaces in the digital twin and what they should contain to integrate agents is shown, as well as the psychosocial aspects to be considered for humans to handle their design.},

  volume={1},
  number={},
  pages={252-257},
  abstract={Electronic components (EC) detection is relevant for Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing, quality inspection, and assurance (cyber-security). Moreover, at end-of-life electronic devices, the PCBs become Waste PCBs (WPCBs), the primary source of high-value materials in electronic waste. However, the recycling process is challenging because of the WPCB’s high composition diversity. EC detection in WPCBs can reduce the uncertainty about WPCBs composition and help select a better recycling process. Nevertheless, large fully-annotated datasets for the PCB domain are available at a high cost. For WPCBs, there is only one publicly available dataset, the PCB-DSLR, and it is partially labeled. As for PCBs, the FICS-PCB dataset is available. However, it contains images of modern and clean PCBs, all in good condition, while the first has broken and dirty parts. Thus, we propose a self-training strategy for object detection algorithms without needing a fully labeled dataset. In the strategy, the YOLOv5 model is used to detect the eight types of electronic components present in FICS-PCB in PCB-DSLR, which initially has labels only for integrated circuits. The process occurs through the interaction between a teacher model, trained with the FICSPCB data, and a student model, which is trained by joining the FICS-PCB data and the teacher-generated labels for PCB-DSLR. The results show that the student model performs better in the electronic components detection task, obtaining greater precision and sensitivity when compared to the teacher model. Since we are dealing with partially labeled data, we provide a low-dimensional representation of the detections of both models using t-SNE.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-12},
  abstract={Due to the partial observability and communication constraints in many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks, centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) has become one of the most widely used MARL paradigms. In CTDE, centralized information is dedicated to learning the allocation of the team reward with a mixing network, while the learning of individual Q-values is usually based on local observations. The insufficient utility of global observation will degrade performance in challenging environments. To this end, this work proposes a novel Centralized Teacher with Decentralized Student (CTDS) framework, which consists of a teacher model and a student model. Specifically, the teacher model allocates the team reward by learning individual Q-values conditioned on global observation, while the student model utilizes the partial observations to approximate the Q-values estimated by the teacher model. In this way, CTDS balances the full utilization of global observation during training and the feasibility of decentralized execution for online inference. Our CTDS framework is generic, which is ready to be applied upon existing CTDE methods to boost their performance. We conduct experiments on a challenging set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks to test the effectiveness of our method and the results show that CTDS outperforms the existing value-based MARL methods.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-13},
  abstract={In the control of complex systems, we observe two diametrical trends: model-based control derived from digital twins, and model-free control through AI. There are also attempts to bridge the gap between the two by incorporating learning-based AI algorithms into digital twins to mitigate mismatches between the digital twin model and the physical system. One of the most straightforward approaches to this is direct input adaptation. In this paper, we ask whether it is useful to employ a generic learning algorithm in such a setting, and our conclusion is “not very”. We denote an algorithm to be more useful than another algorithm based on three aspects: 1) it requires fewer data samples to reach a desired minimal performance, 2) it achieves better performance for a reasonable number of data samples, and 3) it accumulates less regret. In our evaluation, we randomly sample problems from an industrially relevant geometry assurance context and measure the aforementioned performance indicators of 16 different algorithms. Our conclusion is that blackbox optimization algorithms, designed to leverage specific properties of the problem, generally perform better than generic learning algorithms, once again finding that “there is no free lunch”. Note to Practitioners—Digital twins have the potential to improve productivity and quality in complex systems such as manufacturing systems. Their impact on system performance hinges on the accuracy of their digital models around the system’s operating points. Difficult to measure phenomena, such as wear and tear of equipment, however, may cause a mismatch between the digital twin model and the physical system. In this paper, we formalize this problem and compare 16 potential solution strategies under practical aspects. We argue that readily available off-the-shelf blackbox optimization algorithms may prove more useful for this problem, than more recent learning-based approaches. Specifically, gradient-based algorithms will perform best in systems with high-dimensional, continuous, and non-linear performance functions – even in the presence of white measurement noise.},

  abstract={Relevant today is the digitalization of industrial enterprises, which is an evolutionary continuation of the introduction of MES/MOM. At the same time, an important role is played by the construction of mathematical models for various purposes, which are the main component of the Digital Twin development. Digital Twin provides a new philosophy for conducting enterprise production processes based on these models, which is aimed at improving the efficiency of both individual sectors and the enterprise as a whole. To increase the profit of the enterprise, it is necessary to ensure the planned productivity of technological processes, the final indicator of which is the yield of sugar. Taking into account that a significant number of material flows operate at the enterprise, only production flows with which the operator-technologist works are singled out in the work. The selected flows, based on expert assessments, were assigned weighted values of the impact on the overall performance of the sugar production. This made it possible to build a mathematical model that predicts the yield of sugar from input flows. The structure and parameters of this model are determined by machine learning methods. This is a feed-forward neural network MLP 7-23-23-1, which provides forecast accuracy with an error of less than 1%. The model can be used to model, correct, and predict the process conditions of an enterprise, which will increase the overall productivity of the sugar factory.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},

  abstract={Greenhouse horticulture production is associated with high uncertainty and a long learning process due to its high dependency on the outdoor & indoor environment and plant types. Digital Twin (DT) technology enables a faster understanding of greenhouse horticulture facilities, obtaining insight into the production process flow and investigating the consequences of production decisions. However, no digital twin has been developed in this field due to the complexity of greenhouse production. Therefore, this paper presents a case study of a DT development for a Danish greenhouse production flow using multi-method modeling and multi-agent simulation. The results show that the developed DT can accurately represent the greenhouse production process and estimate the plant growth state with an absolute error of 0.31 days compared to the observed production. Furthermore, the developed DT can accurately predict deviations to the plant growth state corresponding to previously observed behavior at the facility. To capture the greenhouse production process flow at the top-level greenhouse DT agent, the underlying physical agents developed included: compartments, growth climate, conveyors, staff, tables, plants, soil machine, table loading, and packing station as well as the packing station. Lastly, the developed DT method supports agent re-usability for other case studies.},

In this paper, we show that a supervisor neural network could be used to predict the validation performance of another target neural network (student) through its training weights. Then based on this behavior, we propose a weight-loss pair-based training framework called REVAL to help decrease overfitting and increase the performance of the student model by using a supervisor model to learn the trajectories of weight updates of the student model. We conduct experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR-100 datasets with naive neural networks and show that we can improve the model classification performance with such simple network structures and training trajectories.

  abstract={Accurate prediction of coefficient of performance (COP) in refrigerant system is beneficial to the overall system performance evaluation and dynamic operation optimization. In this paper, a digital twin model of COP prediction in refrigeration system based on combined machine learning method is proposed. Firstly, several influencing factors are selected guided by the mechanism knowledge, and the correlation coefficients between impact factors and COP value are calculated to further verify their importance in COP prediction. Secondly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) with intrinsic weight optimization are used to capture the characteristics between the influencing factors and COP, while the long short term memory (LSTM) method is used to capture the characteristics of the time series data. Meanwhile, the weights of the CNN, LSTM and MLP methods are optimized in real time by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to minimize the difference between the COP value of physical system and the predicted COP value of digital twin model to realize online self-update. Finally, simulation results show that the MAE, MAPE and RMSE obtained by the proposed method are respectively 7.01 %, 1.71% and 0.08% lower than those obtained by CNN method, 0.92%, 0.24% and 0.01% lower than those obtained by LSTM method, and 2.41%, 0.58% and 0.02% lower than those obtained by MLP method, which have proved that the prediction result of proposed digital twin model for COP prediction is more accurate.},

  abstract={Compared to conventional engine-based powertrains, electrified powertrain exhibit increased energy efficiency and reduced emissions, making electrification a key goal for the automotive industry. For a vehicle with hybrid energy storage system, its performance and lifespan are substantially affected by the energy management system. Reinforcement learning-based methods are gaining popularity in vehicle energy management, but most of the literature in this area focus on pure simulation while hardware implementation is still limited. This paper introduces the digital twin methodology to enhance the Q-learning-based energy management system for battery and ultracapacitor electric vehicles. The digital twin model can exploit the bilateral interdependency between the virtual model and the actual system, which improves the control performance of the energy management system. The physical model is established based on a hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform. In addition, battery degradation is also considered for prolonging the battery lifespan to reduce the operating cost. The validation results of the trained reinforcement learning agent illustrate that the digital twin-enhanced Q-learning energy management system improves the energy efficiency by 4.36% and the battery degradation is reduced by 25.28%.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a digital twin (DT)-assisted adaptive video streaming scheme to enhance personalized quality-of-experience (PQoE). Since PQoE models are user-specific and time-varying, existing schemes based on universal and time-invariant PQoE models may suffer from performance degradation. To address this issue, we first propose a DT-assisted PQoE model construction method to obtain accurate user-specific PQoE models. Specifically, user DTs (UDTs) are respectively constructed for individual users, which can acquire and utilize users' data to accurately tune PQoE model parameters in real time. Next, given the obtained PQoE models, we formulate a resource management problem to maximize the overall long-term PQoE by taking the dynamics of users' locations, video requests, and buffer statuses into account. To solve this problem, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to jointly determine segment version selection, and communication and computing resource allocation. Simulation results on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively enhance PQoE compared with benchmark schemes.},

  abstract={Digital twin technology can be combined with wire-less virtual reality (VR) to provide workers with an immersive virtual industrial manufacturing environment. In this paper, we consider a scenario of utilizing computing resources at the edge servers to render the virtual representation of physical industrial scenes for workers. In order to provide an immersive experience, the rendered virtual representation in the form of high-quality video needs to be delivered with low latency. The quality of delivered contents is associated with rendering resources and content bitrate, and high-quality contents result in large rendering and transmission delay. The joint resource allocation problem has been formulated, allocating limited bandwidth and edge computing resources, and determining the bitrate of content to achieve low latency and high content quality, in which two objectives are conflicting. To solve this problem, we employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based multi-objective optimization approach which decomposes the original problem into a series of subproblems. Instead of training the DRL model for each subproblem with equal number of episodes, an adaptive subproblem model training scheme has been proposed which terminates the training of subproblem model early based on the model convergence to improve the overall training efficiency. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation strategy in terms of content quality and delay.},

Specifically, we construct two-tier digital twins tailored for vehicular networks to capture networking-related features of vehicles and edge servers. By exploiting such features, we propose a two-stage computing resource allocation scheme. First, the central controller periodically generates reference policies for real-time computing resource allocation according to the network dynamics and service demands captured by digital twins of edge servers. Second, computing resources of the edge servers are allocated in real time to individual vehicles via low-complexity matching-based allocation that complies with the reference policies. By leveraging digital twins, the proposed scheme can adapt to dynamic service demands and vehicle mobility in a scalable manner.

To adapt to such challenging settings and better accomplish the network auto-tuning tasks, we propose a generic learnable model-driven framework. We further consider transmit regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding as a usage instance to illustrate the proposed framework. The overall process can be divided into three cascaded stages. First, we design a light neural network for refined prediction of sum rate based on coarse model-driven approximations. Then, the CSI uncertainty is estimated on the learned predictor in an iterative manner. In the last step the regularization term in the transmit RZF precoding is optimized. The effectiveness of the generic framework and the derivative method thereof is showcased via simulation results.},

  abstract={With the widespread use of robotized production lines (RPL) in manufacturing plants, timely and accurate prediction of production line operation performance is very important, which guarantees reasonable adjustment of production planning and resource allocation. The current prediction methods of production line operation performance are mostly off-line prediction, which cannot adjust the prediction model timely according to the dynamic changing characteristics of the manufacturing process, and have the problems of functional lag and low accuracy. In order to address the above issues, a digital twin-driven dynamic prediction method for the operational performance of RPL is proposed. Firstly, the manufacturing process description model and operational performance evaluation indicator are constructed based on multi-source manufacturing data from products, industrial robot equipment, and system operation dimensions. Exploring the time-varying mechanism of the manufacturing system, the digital twin model of RPL is constructed from multi-dimension. Then the correlation between manufacturing data and operational performance is explored using grey relational analysis (GRA). The online extreme learning machine algorithm is proposed to predict the dynamic performance of RPL, which is self-correcting and self-optimizing to realize the dynamic prediction based on the digital twin. Finally, a case study is implemented to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={As wireless systems and protocols evolve to support various services requiring high performance, deploying and operating the wireless mobile networks optimally become more challenging. To address this, artificial intelligence (AI) is getting a tremendous amount of interest for its ability to provide adaptability, scalability, and optimality in an automated and data-driven manner. Operating the network involves decision making processes in highly non-deterministic environments. This calls for the need for RAN Digital Twin, which replicates the states and behaviors of the real networks into virtual simulated networks, so making trial-and-error based optimization possible. However, there still remains challenges in terms of resource-efficiency and real-world applicability. To address efficiency, we propose scenario compaction, which generates a representative condensed scenario using the large volume of real data. We also propose scenario ensemble to train a model robust to the gap between the real and the replicated. As a target application, we tackle a cell on/off based energy-saving operation using reinforcement learning in this paper. Through experiments, we show that our methods provide learning efficiency and they provide an AI module with robust performance when applied to a real base station.},

However, if all sensor data were collected and processed in the cloud, network transmission bandwidth and communication delays would become bottlenecks. The brain is a light weight system that makes decisions based on uncertain observations and We have previously proposed an object recognition method based on a mathematical model of how the brain recognizes information. In this paper, we extend this method. The features of the brain’s recognition of spatial context are modeled by a conditional random field and incorporated into it. We show that our proposal can recognize multiple objects with an accuracy of more than 83.2% even from noisy information, and can be applied to 60 fps video in the evaluation environment.},

  abstract={In real-world scenarios, datasets often perform a long-tailed distribution, making it difficult to train neural net-work models that achieve high accuracy across all classes. In this paper, we explore self-supervised learning for the purpose of learning generalized features and propose a score fusion module to integrate outputs from multiple expert models to obtain a unified prediction. Specifically, we take inspiration from the observation that networks trained on a less unbalanced subset of the distribution tend to produce better performance than networks trained on the entire dataset. However, subsets from tail classes are not adequately represented due to the limitation of data size, which means that their performance is actually unsatisfactory. Therefore, we employ self-supervised learning (SSL) on the whole dataset to obtain a more generalized and transferable feature representation, resulting in a sufficient improvement in subset performance. Unlike previous work that used knowledge distillation models to distill the models trained on a subset to get a unified student model, we propose a score fusion module that directly exploits and integrates the predictions of the subset models. We do extensive experiments on several long-tailed recognition benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our pronosed model.},

  abstract={In many industrial processes it is not possible to measure variables that are crucial to the output quality of the manufactured goods due to manufacturing constraints. One possible approach to overcome this lack of information is using a digital-twin of the manufacturing plant. A digital-twin can make use of data generated by numerical simulation techniques to infer the real time state of the machine. Digital-twins are an established technology and will play a crucial role in optimizing manufacturing plants in the near future. The digital real time state of the manufacturing plant can be used to warn machine operators in case a predefined process window is not reached and the output is expected to violate Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) requirements. This work shows a developed control system and how using a digital twin improves the predictive power of the system. Machine learning models are used to infer the cooling curves of metal sheets in a press hardening process. They are trained on coupled Finite-Element-Method (FEM) Simulation data. We validate the performance of our models on the simulation data and find accurate estimations of the metal blanks temperature with a root mean squared error of 1.6±0.5 K, with this not being possible to measure beforehand.},

  abstract={This paper studies a use case for quickly connecting users with an aerial bass station (BS) in emergency by leveraging digital twin (DT) and robust reinforcement learning (RL). Scattered communities of users are assigned a limited number of channels, and the flying BS is autonomously and optimally placed according to predefined criteria. Q-learning, a common type of RL, is employed as a solution to optimization of BS placement. Two optimization objectives are considered to maximize the per-user data rate in the worst condition and minimize the total BS transmitted power, respectively. To overcome resource limitations of the aerial BS, the RL training with many iterations is done in the DT virtual space connected to the physical space via an aerial BS. In particular, a practically sound max-min technique is proposed to handle the measurement and prediction uncertainties. It is shown that, even if the models used in DT are imperfect and measurements are inaccurate, nearly-optimal results can be obtained in DT. Compared to RL training 100% in the physical space, a huge number of BS moves can be avoided and a significant amount of time and energy can be saved. The assessment results suggest that model and measurement errors, especially when applying DT, should be seriously considered, and the robust optimization technique has potential to handle the uncertainties.},

  abstract={Deep learning-based semantic communications (DLSC) replace the physical blocks in traditional communication systems as end-to-end neural networks. DLSC significantly boost communication efficiency by only transmitting the meaning of data, showing great potentials for applications like automatic driving, digital twin and smart health. However, DLSC are fragile to black-box adversarial attacks due to the openness of wireless channel and sensitivities of neural models. To this end, this paper proposes SemBAT, a novel approach for crafting physical layer black-box adversarial attacks for semantic communication systems. The key ingredients of our method include the training of surrogate encoder and generation of adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we train our surrogate encoder by directly estimating the gradients based on Jacobian-matrixs, and then generate the adversarial perturbations by the particle swarm optimizations. Extensive experiments on a public benchmark show the effectiveness of our proposed SemBAT. We observe that our SemBAT with black-box adversaries can sharply decrease the classification accuracy of the semantic communication system from 78.4% to 11.6%. Meanwhile, such attacks are also imperceptible in terms of image quality metrics measured by the Structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio(PSNR).},

Machine learning is used to maximise the efficiency of purchasing electricity from the grid, and to forecast appropriate adaptive street light brightness levels based on city’s traffic flow and solar irradiance. An application designed in Unity Pro is deployed on a Microsoft HoloLens 2, and it allows the user to view the processed data and control the model street light. It was found that the application performed as desired, displaying information such as voltage, current, carbon emission, electricity price, battery state of charge and LED mode, while enabling control over the model street light. Moreover, the Deep Q-Network machine learning algorithm successfully scheduled to buy electricity at times of low price and low carbon intensity, while the Long Short-Term Memory algorithm accurately forecasted traffic flow with mean Root-Mean-Square Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error values of 12.0% and 20.0% respectively.},

  abstract={Assessment is a critical component of any teaching-learning process. It is the only way to gain a better understanding of the knowledge and abilities of the learners, especially in a collaborative learning environment. The learner must pay special attention to interactions and real-world context when selecting collaborative situations and activities. As a result, it is critical to ensure that assessment methods and techniques are adapted so that the learning process is better suited to each group of learners, with their unique learning style, background, needs, previous experiences, and most importantly, context. This paper addressed two major issues in the development of a personalized formative assessment system that will be used to assess the knowledge, skills, and competencies of individual and group learners in an online collaborative learning environment. One approach is to design an adaptive assessment path that helps learners achieve specific learning goals based on previous learner performance, level, and context. The other is to make a personalized recommendation using a Context-Aware Recommender System (CARS), which monitors group formation while performing collaborative assessment activities. To formalize and well define our proposed system, we suggest a semantic web approach using ontologies and eLearning standards, CMI5 to describe the proposed assessment path, and IEEE PAPI for the learner model, all of which allow data reusability and interoperability.},

  abstract={Predicting the evolution of Covid19 pandemic has been a challenge as it is significantly influenced by the characteristics of people, places and localities, dominant virus strains, extent of vaccination, and adherence to pandemic control interventions. Traditional SEIR based analyses help to arrive at a coarse-grained ‘lumped up’ understanding of pandemic evolution which is found wanting to determine locality-specific measures of controlling the pandemic. We comprehend the problem space from system theory perspective to develop a fine-grained simulatable city digital-twin for “in-silico” experimentations to systematically explore - Which indicators influence infection spread to what extent? Which intervention to introduce, and when, to control the pandemic with some a-priori assurance? How best to return to a new normal without compromising individual health safety? This paper presents a digital twin centric simulation-based approach, illustrates it in a real-world context of an Indian City, and summarizes the learning and insights based on this experience.},

  abstract={Technological innovations are expanding rapidly in the public safety sector providing opportunities for more targeted and comprehensive urban crime deterrence and detection. Yet, the spatial dispersion of crimes may vary over time. Therefore, it is unclear whether and how sensors can optimally impact crime rates. We developed a Smart City Digital Twin-based method to dynamically place license plate reader (LPR) sensors and improve their detection and deterrence performance. Utilizing continuously updated crime records, the convolutional long short-term memory algorithm predicted areas crimes were most likely to occur. Then, a Monte Carlo traffic simulation simulated suspect vehicle movements to determine the most likely routes to flee crime scenes. Dynamic LPR placement predictions were made weekly, capturing the spatiotemporal variation in crimes and enhancing LPR performance relative to static placement. We tested the proposed method in Warner Robins, GA, and results support the method's promise in detecting and deterring crime.},

  abstract={The construction industry is struggling with low productivity rates because of a low level of digitalization, dynamic interactions, and uncontrollable circumstances on sites, which make the planning process complex. Usage of the digital twin construction paradigm enables to facilitate construction management and leverage the sector's unexploited potential. This research addresses current shortcomings by real-time discrete event simulation. During crane operations, kinematic data were collected, which were classified by machine learning algorithms for activity recognition and duration extraction. Based on the identified durations, Goodness-of-Fit techniques determined suitable probability density functions. The resulting probability density functions were used as input parameters in stochastic discrete event simulations. It was shown that with enriched data collection, probability density functions have to be updated. The data-driven discrete event simulation facilitates decision-making processes by providing more reliable real-time information for the planning of upcoming construction works. Thus, data-based instead of experience-based management can be enabled.},

  abstract={in order to create a digital twin of the spine to simulate the behavior of the spine after various interventions, the task of automating the marking of the vertebral bodies on radiographs was formulated. The presented work describes the developed approaches to solving the problem of marking the vertebral bodies on radiographs, and also describes algorithms for extracting images of the spine and images of individual vertebrae. For the detection of images of each individual vertebra, the YOLOv5 model was used, and an ensemble of regression models was created to solve the problem of marking the image of each individual vertebra. After a series of experiments, marking errors were estimated at 4.6% using the ratio of coordinates obtained using trained models and correctly marked data. Theories were also put forward about the possible improvement of the created software by dividing the vertebrae into two subclasses in order to reduce the markup error to the desired 0.8%.},

  abstract={This paper presents the results of ongoing work. Today, personalization is one of the main trends in education. Universities collect and analyze data about the students' identity and their needs in order to develop specialized systems that support the personalization of the educational process. The purpose of the current work is to verify the applicability of the "Learner model" that was designed previously. This model is one of the main component of universities' intelligent learning system architecture. This model is based on the results of psychometric test. We increased the sample of students by including new observations and new predictors. Having performed preliminary data preparation, we obtained linear regression models. The results of psychometric tests were used as independent predictors (regressors). We tested students from the 2nd to 4th year of the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatics. The dependent variable is the general ECTS score, as well as the average score for the groups of disciplines (mathematical, work-oriented, humanitarian). We compared the resulting models with those obtained using a smaller sample. In general, our conclusion was confirmed.},

  abstract={Machine learning proxy models are often used to speed up or completely replace complex computational models. The greatly reduced and deterministic computational costs enable new use cases such as digital twin control systems and global optimization. The challenge of building these proxy models is generating the training data. A naive uniform sampling of the input space can result in a non-uniform sampling of the output space of a model. This can cause gaps in the training data coverage that can miss finer scale details resulting in poor accuracy. While larger and larger data sets could eventually fill in these gaps, the computational burden of full-scale simulation codes can make this prohibitive. In this paper, we present an adaptive data generation method that utilizes uncertainty estimation to identify regions where training data should be augmented. By targeting data generation to areas of need, representative data sets can be generated efficiently. The effectiveness of this method will be demonstrated on a simple one-dimensional function and a complex multidimensional physics model.},

  abstract={Machine learning algorithms typically assume that the training and test samples come from the same distributions, i.e., in-distribution. However, in open-world scenarios, streaming big data can be Out-Of-Distribution (OOD), rendering these algorithms ineffective. Prior solutions to the OOD challenge seek to identify invariant features across different training domains. The underlying assumption is that these invariant features should also work reasonably well in the unlabeled target domain. By contrast, this work is interested in the domain-specific features that include both invariant features and features unique to the target domain. We propose a simple yet effective approach that relies on correlations in general regardless of whether the features are invariant or not. Our approach uses the most confidently predicted samples identified by an OOD base model (teacher model) to train a new model (student model) that effectively adapts to the target domain. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the performance is improved over the SOTA by ∼10-20%.},

  abstract={Recently Cyber-Physical Systems, Digital Transformation, and Digital Twin have been discussed towards the digitalization of service to people thanks to the integration of information, intelligence, communication, and robot technologies. topological structure is useful to extract features from given or measured big data and to simulate a real-world phenomenon in such a cyber world. Therefore, we proposed the concept of topological twin. The aim of topological twin is to (1) extract topological structures hidden implicitly in the real world, (2) reproduce them explicitly in the cyber world, and (3) simulate and analyze the real world in the cyber world. The topological twin plays the important role in extracting and connecting structures hidden in real world from the mutliscopic point of view. In this talk, we discuss the concept of topological twin for sophisticated service to people in order to bridge the cyber-physical gap from the multiscopic point of view. First, we discuss the role of trailer living laboratory as a new style of smart home in the future society. We can bring the trailer living laboratory to elderly houses, hospitals, and public spaces, and discuss the co-creation towards open innovation using daily life settings with multi-stakeholder approach. Next, we explain various types of topological mapping methods, unsupervised learning methods, and graph-based methods as the methodology of topological intelligence. One of them is Growing Neural Gas (GNG) that can dynamically change the topological structure composed of nodes and edges. We have proposed various types of methods based on multi-scale batch-learning GNG called Fast GNG. Next, we show the comparison result of Fast GNG with other methods. Furthermore, we show several experimental results of multiscopic topological twin in the trailer living laboratory. Finally, we discuss the future direction of researches on the multiscopic topological twin.},

  abstract={We propose an ensemble learning framework with Poisson sub-sampling to effectively train a collection of teacher models to issue some differential privacy (DP) guarantee for training data. Through boosting under DP, a student model derived from the training data suffers little model degradation from the models trained with no privacy protection. Our proposed solution leverages upon two mechanisms, namely: (i) a privacy budget amplification via Poisson sub-sampling to train a target prediction model that requires less noise to achieve a same level of privacy budget, and (ii) a combination of the sub-sampling technique and an ensemble teacher-student learning framework that introduces DP-preserving noise at the output of the teacher models and transfers DP-preserving properties via noisy labels. Privacy-preserving student models are then trained with the noisy labels to learn the knowledge with DP-protection from the teacher model ensemble. Experimental evidences on spoken command recognition and continuous speech recognition of Mandarin speech show that our proposed framework greatly outperforms existing state-of-the-art DP-preserving algorithms in both ASR tasks.},

  abstract={Thereis a paucity of studies on the consumption of digital content by elderly people utilising smart devices as well as strategies to get elderly people acquainted with smart gadgets. Usability and familiarity with smart devices for senior persons to utilise and get the most out of smart devices and digital content must be prioritised. A cognitive reaction-based intelligent UI suited for senior persons is proposed in this paper, which is based on the user's cognitive performance and demographics. A cognitive response feedback and demography dataset was built by interviewing a group of elderly in Malaysia. The context of the interview is associated with the unique cognitive keywords that may be anticipated by contextual semantic search. In this paper, two classifiers are used, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naïve Bayes (NB), and they are compared in terms of classification performances. The classifiers are validated using k-fold cross-validation (to-folds) using unigram TF-IDF and bigram TF-IDF, and the results were presented using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. Thus, user interface (UI) pre-sets lists will be matched to the user model based on the dataset classification result and be visualized using a mobile app interface builder.},

  pages={837-842},
  abstract={Converting wearable sensor data to actionable health insights has witnessed large interest in recent years. Deep learning methods have been utilized in and have achieved a lot of successes in various applications involving wearables fields. However, wearable sensor data has unique issues related to sensitivity and variability between subjects, and dependency on sampling-rate for analysis. To mitigate these issues, a different type of analysis using topological data analysis has shown promise as well. Topological data analysis (TDA) captures robust features, such as persistence images (PI), in complex data through the persistent homology algorithm, which holds the promise of boosting machine learning performance. However, because of the computational load required by TDA methods for large-scale data, integration and implementation has lagged behind. Further, many applications involving wearables require models to be compact enough to allow deployment on edge-devices. In this context, knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely applied to generate a small model (student model), using a pre-trained high-capacity network (teacher model). In this paper, we propose a new KD strategy using two teacher models - one that uses the raw time-series and another that uses persistence images from the time-series. These two teachers then train a student using KD. In essence, the student learns from heterogeneous teachers providing different knowledge. To consider different properties in features from teachers, we apply an annealing strategy and adaptive temperature in KD. Finally, a robust student model is distilled, which utilizes the time series data only. We find that incorporation of persistence features via second teacher leads to significantly improved performance. This approach provides a unique way of fusing deep-learning with topological features to develop effective models.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose an offline Deep Adaptive Dynamic Programming (DADP) algorithm to improve the real-time performance of trajectory tracking control. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an effective method for solving nonlinear optimal control problems of trajectory tracking, while as an online solution, the processing speed of MPC is too slow to meet the high real-time requirements of automatic driving motion control, especially under long predictive step length. DADP consists of two parts, policy evaluation and policy improvement, where both the policy function and the evaluation function are approximated by neural networks mapping the state of agent to control outputs and value evaluation of the state respectively. Besides, multi-agent parallel training is adopted to speed up the neural network training. The optimal policy function is obtained after the iterations of policy evaluation and policy improvement reach the final equilibrium. Finally, double lane change tracking is performed on the CarSim digital twin platform verifying the high real-time performance of DADP.},

  abstract={The meta universe includes a complete mapping of the real world. The immersive feeling of the meta universe can be seen as the expansion of the real world simulation. It is of great significance to complete the expansion and optimization of the real world in the virtual environment. So it is inevitable for the meta universe to simulate various real world scenes. It has a wide application prospect to establish virtual images and virtual objects in the simulation scenes of the meta universe, and to drive, interact and optimize them in an intelligent way. The scope of the meta universe is huge, there are many scenes, and the implementation methods are also different. Firstly, this paper gives a basic implementation framework of the mapping of the meta universe to the real scene. On this framework, it takes the meta universe to the industrial scene as the starting point, and simulates the industrial robot as the basic virtual image of the robot in this environment. In the meta universe scene of virtual reality fusion, the motion route of the simulated industrial robot realized by the framework proposed in this paper is optimized by reinforcement learning. This digital twin scene is also of great significance to the path optimization of robots in the world. This framework can be extended to various field scenes of each meta universe to complete the construction of the virtual environment of the meta universe.},

  abstract={Aerial drones come in handy in a variety of science and research applications, sometimes even cause privacy harms during aerial surveillance. In many anti-drone situations, detection, tracking, and classification of drones are of great significance to secure the airspace. Drones are small in size, different in appearance, and have different flight attitudes for various flight environments, which makes the drone data sets too expensive to annotate and the foreground-background imbalance occurs in drone detection. Previous works on drone detection have focused on supervised learning, which depends on large labeled data set. To alleviate the problem of scarce labeled data sets, Semi-Supervised Learning can be employed to leverage unlabeled samples. In this paper, we propose a Semi-Supervised Object Detection method Decoupled Teacher to use unlabeled data and address the foreground-background imbalance issue. Specifically, Decoupled Teacher decouples the Exponential Moving Average mechanism in the general SSOD paradigm, and applies a fusion method of weak/strong data augmentation. We have bench-marked our method and the state-of-the-art SSOD methods using two publicly available drone data sets. The experiment results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

We introduce an attention mechanism to transfer the attention map of the middle layer of the teacher model to the student model as knowledge, hoping that the student model will focus on the region that the teacher model focuses on, thereby distinguishing the difference between normal regions and abnormal regions, and improving the accuracy of detecting anomalies.

  abstract={Deep Neural Network (DNN) models have brought significant performance gains to machine learning tasks. Nevertheless, the huge storage and computational costs of high-performance models severely limit their deployment on resource-limited embedded devices. Knowledge distillation (KD) is the mainstream approach for models compression, but the existing KD framework has some limitations. First, the student model underperforms when there is a considerable capacity gap between the student and teacher models, which reduces the model compression rate in knowledge distillation. Second, compared with training from scratch, the billions of additional forward propagation of the complex teacher model is time-consuming, resulting longer train time in the distillation process. This paper proposes AKD, an efficient difference-adaptive knowledge distillation framework. AKD consists of two modules. The distillation module uses a modified auxiliary teaching architecture as the backbone, and the adaptive module introduces a difference-adaptive method, which can adjust the teacher model adaptively according to the continuously improving representation ability of the student model. Experimental results on different kinds of datasets and models indicate that AKD not only improves the efficiency of distillation, but also enhances the performance of the compact student model and raise the compression rate.},

  abstract={Personalized news headline generation aims to sum-marize a news article as a news headline, according to the preference of a specific user. It can help users filter their interested news quickly and increase the news click rates for news providers. However, in this field, when learning user interests from their historically clicked news, existing research only learned user interests on word and news level, ignoring sentence level informativeness. This paper proposes a user model, adding sentence-level informativeness to learn user interests, and further guide the news headline generation. To be more detailed, based on attention layers, sentence and news are represented as the weighted sum of word and sentence representations, respectively. To further explore the correlation between different news contents (news title, body, and topic information), the query vectors in the attention layers are replaced by news content. Experiments on the dataset PENS show that the performance of these two models is better than the baseline model on the evaluation metrics ROUGE. Finally, some future directions are discussed, including interactions across informativeness levels and contents.},

  abstract={Building a new-type power system with renewable energy is the key to achieving the target of carbon peak and carbon neutrality, which has been the consensus of the clean, low-carbon, and safe energy transition. The construction of a new-type power system at the industrial park level is the first demonstration of the coordinated optimization and intelligent control of power sources, grid, load, and energy storage to make overall planning to achieve diversified development. To sustain the ‘balance, security, diversity, and low cost’ construction goals of the new-type power system at the park level, the power grid dispatching and control system is transformed to the direction of intelligence and automation, which is reflected in the rapid emergence and construction of complex systems such as digital twin, simulation, reinforcement learning, model training and prediction, and intelligent decision-making of the EMS (Energy Manage System). This brings more complex data sharing, interaction, construction, and other technical requirements than ever before. At the same time, along with the simultaneous construction of new power systems such as micro-grids, virtual power plants, and distributed photovoltaic systems, it has exacerbated the problems of data divergence from business, low data utilization, and centralized architecture brought by the data lakes and data warehouses under the previous monolithic architecture, leading to the data model hard to deploy to meet the demand for efficient collection, interaction, and sharing of scattered and heterogeneous data under the new generation energy structure and greatly increases the work pressure of the data team, making the data team a bottleneck for business applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel design scheme of data processing framework with the data mesh concept, supports the federal computing and analysis engine by building a distributed metadata center, changes the previous centralized data modeling method through data service and productization, realizes data sharing and interaction between complex multi-systems by defining service invocation and encapsulation technology means, improves data utilization, and better supports the automation, rationalization, and balanced construction of the intelligent dispatch system to meet the challenges and requirements brought by the new-type park-level power system.},

  abstract={Although the recent advances in pre-training language models have achieved great success and migrated annotation bottleneck for many tasks, the task-specific fine-tuning for text classification still requires thousands of labeled samples or even more. When few human annotations are available, active self-training is one of the efficient approaches for reducing human annotation costs which integrates pseudo labels of self-training into the procedure of active learning. The traditional active self-training approaches mix manual labels and pseudo labels indistinguishably without considering the impact of active learning and self-training on each other. There are two problems for active self-training in few-shot text classification: (1) The noise in a large number of pseudo-labels may mislead the model training. (2) The confusing samples in overlap boundaries between classes are especially difficult to identify correctly with a few labels. To solve these problems, we propose UCL-AST, an active self-training framework that boosts the performance of the active teacher model to provide superior pseudo labels for the self-training student model and facilitates the active teacher model to learn more clear class boundaries with uncertainty-aware clouded logits in few-shot. The extensive experiments and visualization analysis have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework on four datasets compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Over the last decade, the rapid growth of wind power is driving an increase of efforts in defining the frameworks and rules for the connection of wind power plants (WPPs) through the grid codes and standards, making testing/validation more demanding and complex for wind turbine (WT) manufacturers and WPP developers. Traditionally, WT manufacturers carry out grid compliance tests at full-scale prototype turbines whereas WPP developers and Transmission System Operators (TSOs) mainly perform studies for new WPPs based on offline RMS and EMT simulations. Until now, these strategies have been sufficient for ensuring grid compliance of WTs and WPPs, however moving forward the wind sector needs new testing methods to meet the increasing WT capacity, WPP complexity, and deployment pace to achieve society's desired sustainability targets. In this paper, the emerging strategies that target these challenges are presented as: a) subsystems and component testing of WTs specified in IEC 61400- 21-4; b) - hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) real time simulation for WT/WPP control and protection appraisals (future 61400-21-5). Finally, a future outlook is given on the importance of addressing model validation and how these strategies can be complemented with other modern analytical tools such as artificial intelligence/machine learning, data-driven dynamic modelling, digital twin technology, and software-in-the-loop (SiL) real time simulation.},

To examine the efficiency of the proposed model, we compare its simulation accuracy to a physical based DT, i.e., Single Diode Model (SDM), and data driven DTs, i.e., Support Vector Machines (SVM), Feed Foreword Neural Networks (FFNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Additionally, in terms of data-driven DTs, two different scenarios have been implemented for the selected inputs (solar irradiance and panels' temperature). The results highlight that the proposed model has the highest simulation accuracy, since it leads to lower MAE compared to SDM, while at the same time its accuracy is comparable to the simple LSTM model.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Control valves are integral to the piping infrastructure in most process industries including nuclear, oil and gas, and chemical. They serve as pressure, temperature, and flow rate regulators. Hence detailed information about these parameters within the complex valve shape is particularly useful for design, optimisation, and efficient operation of control valves. For better reliability and operation under safety-critical installations, extensive research is being carried out to develop multi-layer and knowledge-intensive digital twins for such valves. This paper reports a computational investigation to determine the local valve flow coefficient (Cv) at various valve opening positions (VOP)/flow rate conditions and develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the local Cv distribution within the valve-pipe system. This is expected to provide sufficient information to embed extensive knowledge base in the valve’s digital twin. Ten internal locations (at L/D=1 to 10) were chosen for data extraction to give a detailed Cv profile from the pipe inlet through the valve to the pipe outlet. Three VOPs (20, 60, and 100%) were considered and for each, three inlet velocities of 1, 2 and 3 m/s were simulated. This combination resulted in a database of 90 data-points which were used to train the ANN using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. MATLAB’s Neural Network Toolbox was used with 70%, 15%, and 15% of the data used for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Model performance was measured using the mean-square-error and square-of-residuals (R2) metrics. Sensitivity analysis of hidden layer neuron number was conducted, and the results show that 10 neurons produced a robust prediction of the CV profile. An overall average R2 of 0.92 was obtained. Hence, it may be efficiently used for the valve’s internal (rather than global) CV prediction for design and other purposes – including implementation within digital twin architectures for remote/condition monitoring in difficult to reach areas such as offshore and within complex industrial sites.},

  abstract={Open Social Learner Model (OSLM) is a kind of learning models in the field of personalized learning systems. While in traditional personalization systems, student models representing the students’ current states of knowledge are hidden from students and used solely to personalize the educational process, OSLM gives students an opportunity to view, explore, compare peers, and even correct their own knowledge states. In this paper, we propose SmartMe, which is an online learning system for university-level programming algorithm courses, where students can practice exercises to improve their algorithm skills. The questions are presented in the form of multiple-choice questions, which each question links one or more targeted skills. There are two main modules in SmartMe, which are OSLM and case example recommender. The recommender aimed to find case examples based on their similarities with questions and student models. For this study, we applied a cosine similarity algorithm and webbing matrix. To measure the usability of the OSLM and case example recommender, both modules were evaluated by experts and students. The results show that 80.58% of participants found that the combination of OSLM and the case example recommender is useful. Furthermore, the suitability between the recommended case examples and the exercises was 85.86%, based on the expert review.},

  abstract={Coke-oven is not a closed, stable and continuous reaction device in the actual production process. It has periodic operation procedures and the transformation of production rhythm. These factors lead to the strong nonlinear and uncertain characteristics of coke-oven production process. It is difficult to accurately model the gas generation process from the reaction mechanism. In this paper, a digital twin model for forecast of coke-oven gas generationcoke-oven in metallurgical industry based on long short term memory network (LSTM) is proposed. The forecasting models of coke-oven gas based on neural network does not need to study the mechanism of complex chemical reaction. It only needs to determine the correlation characteristics of parameters, and then conduct model training through sufficient historical data, so as to obtain accurate predictive results, which can provide data support for advanced applications such as abnormal working condition early warning and integrated energy management system.},

  abstract={Improving the interactivity and interconnectivity between people is one of the highlights of the Metaverse. The Metaverse relies on a core approach, digital twinning, which is a means to replicate physical world objects, people, actions and scenes onto the virtual world. Being able to access scenes and information associated with the physical world, in the Metaverse in real-time and under mobility, is essential in developing a highly accessible, interactive and interconnective experience for all users. This development allows users from other locations to access high-quality real-world and up-to-date information about events happening in another location, and socialize with others hyper-interactively. Nevertheless, receiving continual, smooth updates generated by others from the Metaverse is a challenging task due to the large data size of the virtual world graphics and the need for low latency transmission. With the development of Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR), users can interact via the Metaverse in a highly interactive manner, even under mobility. Hence in our work, we considered an environment with users in moving Internet of Vehicles (IoV), downloading real-time virtual world updates from Metaverse Service Provider Cell Stations (MSPCSs) via wireless communications. We design an environment with multiple cell stations, where there will be a handover of users' virtual world graphic download tasks between cell stations. As transmission latency is the primary concern in receiving virtual world updates under mobility, our work aims to allocate system resources to minimize the total time taken for users in vehicles to download their virtual world scenes from the cell stations. We utilize a deep reinforcement learning approach and evaluate the performance of the algorithms under different environmental configurations. Our work provides a use case of the Metaverse over AI-enabled 6G wireless communications.},

  abstract={Deep learning-based detection of marine microalgae in natural waters can meet the need for rapid monitoring, facilitating researchers in marine and environmental sciences, while also paving the way for downstream cellular analysis tasks. We use a new training scheme for marine microalgae detection that consists of two phases: a teacher benchmark model phase and a student model learning phase. Using teacher model supervision to get better student model training results. Through a simple and fast image fusion method, we can obtain more realistic algae-generated images to extend the training set and eventually improve the convergence speed and performance of the model. Based on the algorithms of YOLOv5 and YOLOv6, we use the DHLC backbone network fusion method to fuse features from different levels of C3 modules and BepC3 modules together as the input of the PANet middle layer. We also use the module in BoTNet network to obtain stronger feature extraction capability by introducing self-attention mechanism in the yolo model. Since there are many small targets in marine microalgae images, we also extend the YOLOv6l model to the more powerful YOLOv6l-P6 model, which can get better detection results in the input image size of 1280. In addition, we also use time-test augmentation (TTA), weighted boxes fusion (WBF) and Single-class wighted boxes fusion (SinWBF) techniques to optimize the performance of each class. These strategies greatly improve the model detection performance and robustness under the conditions of small amount of marine microalgae microscopic image data. Finally our solution won the first place on the “Vision Meets Algae” Object Detection Challenge, and got 58.25 MAP.},

  abstract={Network Digital Twin is a model that emulates the behavior of a real communication network and is commonly used for prototyping, testing, and network optimization. Utilizing the inherent graph structure in the communication network, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling digital twins of small-scale network. However, they face the challenge of scaling up the GNN model to make predictions on large-scale networks. In this paper, we build a scalable network digital twin capable of predicting the per-path mean delay from traffic and routing configuration on larger topology networks. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of our proposed solutions when modeled using different neural network architectures and combined through various ensemble methods. We explore the performance of GNN models implemented using traditional Artificial Neural Networks and the novel Spiking Neural Network (SNN) techniques. We study the performance of different ensemble weighing techniques such as Averaging, Grid Search, and a Reinforcement Learning(RL)-based weighing technique.

  abstract={The emergence of digital twins provides a new technical means for enabling cyber-physical manufacturing systems. When digital twins are applied in workshops, a major problem is how to use virtual-real mapping to connect the cyber and the physical world to improve decision-making and management in the workshop, to enable the self-adaptive scheduling automation of flexible workshops in multi-disturbance and uncertain production environments. This paper studies the adaptive scheduling of flexible workshops and combines the digital twin technology to establish a digitaltwin-based prototype system of self-adaptive scheduling of flexible workshop. Targeting the real-time and adaptability requirements of workshop scheduling in dynamic production environments, and based on the digital twin environment of workshops, this paper selects the average delivery time of workpieces as the optimization target, and proposes a Deep Q-network (DQN) method driven by the perception-cognitive dual system. The perception system generates workshop states using digital twins and knowledge graphs; the cognitive system abstracts the scheduling process into a process sequencing agent to optimize the completion time, and uses a workshop state matrix to describe the constraints of the problem, introducing order selection and workpiece selection actions step by step into the scheduling decision-making process; then a reward function is designed to evaluate the decision. The superiority of the proposed method is verified by the example verification and algorithm comparison analysis in the sewing workshop of a garment factory.},

  abstract={The IoT devices are widely used in Industrial environment, but usually suffers the resource and energy bottlenecks which may affect the task processing efficiency. Computation offloading is a mechanism to utilize resources well by moving resource-intensive applications from terminal devices to network edge or cloud servers. However, there are still some challenges in applying computation offloading to the Industrial Internet environment due to the complexity and uncertainty of the actual industrial environment. Emerging Digital Twin (DT) is capable of predicting, estimating, and analyzing the real-time state of physical entities and monitoring system environments by creating virtual models of physical entities. Therefore, in this paper, we design a Digital Twin-assisted End-Edge-Cloud collaboration architecture for Industrial Internet (DT-EEC) and propose a computation offloading method based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to minimize the average delay and energy consumption of task processing under this architecture. In addition, we find the extra delay and energy consumption caused by the unreliability of computing nodes are often ignored in previous studies, so the reliability of IoT terminal devices and edge servers are also considered in our computation offloading. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in different scenarios.},

  abstract={UAV-assisted vehicle-edge-computing (VEC) has become a viable solution for a new generation of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and has attracted widespread attention from academia and industry. Compared with fixed ground devices, UAV can provide line-of-sight (LoS) link and has good mobility, which better matches the needs of individual wireless connectivity and high mobility of vehicle. However, the mobility of UAVs leads to dynamic changes in the network topology environment and brings new challenges in the rational path planning of UAVs, which brings new problems for network autonomous decision-making to achieve network resource allocation and load balancing. Therefore, in order to solve above problems, we introduce digital twins-based multi-agent deep Q-network (DT-based MADQN). Digital twin (DT) collects network data and reconstructs the network environment and provides the basis for Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model training. DRL model provides a network decision-making solution based on real-time network status and empirical data. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Compared to the baseline algorithm, it reduces the average task delay by 16.4% and improves the task completion rate by 97.6%.},

  abstract={E-learning proves its importance in the diverse educational levels over traditional education. An adaptive e-learning system needs to deduce the learner model for adding personalization to instructional websites. The learner model is the perception repository about the e-content user, which can be inferred implicitly by employing meaningful semantic analysis of the text. In this research, a novel methodology is proposed to conceptually deduce the semantic learner model for personalized e-learning recommendations. Firstly, Conceptual Learner Model (CLM) is developed based on the learner's behavior and context-based text semantic representation by exploiting concepts from the ConceptNet knowledge base, with a significant association of patterns and rules. Then, Expanded Contextual Learner Model (ECLM) is developed by exploring the latent semantics in graphs to add concepts with the common-sense meanings that exceeded the named entities. The learner's knowledge graph is defined based on contextually associated concepts. Semantic relations in ConceptNet are exploited to extend learner models. The Normalized Particle Swarm Optimization (NPSO) algorithm is used to learn the importance of the relation types between the concepts. Thus, CLM and ECLM each are represented as a vector of weighted concepts in which updating is obtained automatically. The proposed recommendation system incorporates dynamic learner models to predict an appropriate e-content with the highest ranking, matching the true needs of a particular learner. Our simulation results show that the performance of ECLM is better Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) value 0.780 than other existing methods.},

  abstract={Enhancing virtual learning platforms need to adapt new intelligent mechanisms so that long-term learner experience can be improved. Sentiment Analysis gives us perception on how a specific scientific material is suitable to be recommended to the learner. It depends on the feedback of a similar learner taking many factors under consideration such as preference, knowledge level, and learning pattern. In this work, a hybrid e-learning recommendation system is proposed based on individualization and Sentiment Analysis. A new approach is provided for modelling the semantic user model based on the generated semantic matrix to capture the learner's preferences based on their selections of interest. The extracted semantic matrix is used for text representation by utilizing ConceptNet knowledge base which relies on contextual graph and expanded terms to represent the correlation among terms and materials. On the extracted terms from semantic user model, Word Embeddings-Based-Sentiment Analysis (WEBSA) must recommend the learning materials with highest rating to the learners properly. Variant models of (WEBSA) are proposed relying on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate effective vocabulary representations along with the use of qualitative customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for sentiment multi-classification tasks. To validate the language model, two datasets are used, a tailored dataset that has been created by scraping reviews of different e-learning resources, and a public dataset. From the experimental results, it has been found that the lowest error rate is achieved with our customized dataset, where the model named CNN-Specific-Task-CBOWBSA outperforms than others with 89.26% accuracy.},

  abstract={Federated distillation (FD) is a popular novel algorithmic paradigm for Federated learning (FL), which achieves training performance competitive to prior parameter averaging-based methods, while additionally allowing the clients to train different model architectures, by distilling the client predictions on an unlabeled auxiliary set of data into a student model. In this work, we propose FedAUX, an extension to FD, which, under the same set of assumptions, drastically improves the performance by deriving maximum utility from the unlabeled auxiliary data. FedAUX modifies the FD training procedure in two ways: First, unsupervised pre-training on the auxiliary data is performed to find a suitable model initialization for the distributed training. Second,  $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ -differentially private certainty scoring is used to weight the ensemble predictions on the auxiliary data according to the certainty of each client model. Experiments on large-scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer models demonstrate that our proposed method achieves remarkable performance improvements over state-of-the-art FL methods, without adding appreciable computation, communication, or privacy cost. For instance, when training ResNet8 on non-independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) subsets of CIFAR10, FedAUX raises the maximum achieved validation accuracy from 30.4% to 78.1%, further closing the gap to centralized training performance.

  pages={785-795},
  abstract={Nuclei segmentation is an essential step in DNA ploidy analysis by image-based cytometry (DNA-ICM) which is widely used in cytopathology and allows an objective measurement of DNA content (ploidy). The routine fully supervised learning-based method requires often tedious and expensive pixel-wise labels. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised nuclei segmentation framework which exploits only sparsely annotated bounding boxes, without any segmentation labels. The key is to integrate the traditional image segmentation and self-training into fully supervised instance segmentation. We first leverage the traditional segmentation to generate coarse masks for each box-annotated nucleus to supervise the training of a teacher model, which is then responsible for both the refinement of these coarse masks and pseudo labels generation of unlabeled nuclei. These pseudo labels and refined masks along with the original manually annotated bounding boxes jointly supervise the training of student model. Both teacher and student share the same architecture and especially the student is initialized by the teacher. We have extensively evaluated our method with both our DNA-ICM dataset and public cytopathological dataset. Without bells and whistles, our method outperforms all existing weakly supervised entries on both datasets. Code and our DNA-ICM dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/CVIU-CSU/Weakly-Supervised-Nuclei-Segmentation.},

  abstract={Transfer learning is prevalent as a technique to efficiently generate new models (Student models) based on the knowledge transferred from a pre-trained model (Teacher model). However, Teacher models are often publicly available for sharing and reuse, which inevitably introduces vulnerability to trigger severe attacks against transfer learning systems. In this article, we take a first step towards mitigating one of the most advanced misclassification attacks in transfer learning. We design a distilled differentiator via activation-based network pruning to enervate the attack transferability while retaining accuracy. We adopt an ensemble structure from variant differentiators to improve the defence robustness. To avoid the bloated ensemble size during inference, we propose a two-phase defence, in which inference from the Student model is first performed to narrow down the candidate differentiators to be assembled, and later only a small, fixed number of them can be chosen to validate clean or reject adversarial inputs effectively. Our comprehensive evaluations on both large and small image recognition tasks confirm that the Student models with our defence of only 5 differentiators are immune to over 90% of the adversarial inputs with an accuracy loss of less than 10%. Our comparison also demonstrates that our design outperforms prior problematic defences.},

The traditional architecture cannot process vast amounts of data exchanges and provide entities with trust. The future IIoT is expected to be a decentralized architecture in which blockchain and digital twin-driven IIoT can enable trusted data exchanges. However, this architecture cannot obtain huge amounts of external real-time data and isolated data. Moreover, it cannot handle complex industrial computing tasks. Therefore, we combine oracle with decentralized learning to propose a novel IIoT-oriented digital twin architecture. We also propose an effective decentralized collaboration mechanism to support external data and resources exchanges. Moreover, we propose a novel computing collaboration mechanism to expand the learning capabilities of the industrial ecology. Experiments show that our proposed paradigm has less processing time, a more stable process, and better learning ability compared to other paradigms.},

  pages={8743-8752},
  abstract={Existing online knowledge distillation approaches either adopt the student with the best performance or construct an ensemble model for better holistic performance. However, the former strategy ignores other students’ information, while the latter increases the computational complexity during deployment. In this article, we propose a novel method for online knowledge distillation, termed feature fusion and self-distillation (FFSD), which comprises two key components: FFSD, toward solving the above problems in a unified framework. Different from previous works, where all students are treated equally, the proposed FFSD splits them into a leader student set and a common student set. Then, the feature fusion module converts the concatenation of feature maps from all common students into a fused feature map. The fused representation is used to assist the learning of the leader student. To enable the leader student to absorb more diverse information, we design an enhancement strategy to increase the diversity among students. Besides, a self-distillation module is adopted to convert the feature map of deeper layers into a shallower one. Then, the shallower layers are encouraged to mimic the transformed feature maps of the deeper layers, which helps the students to generalize better. After training, we simply adopt the leader student, which achieves superior performance, over the common students, without increasing the storage or inference cost. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of our FFSD over existing works. The code is available at https://github.com/SJLeo/FFSD.},

  abstract={Nowadays, emerging sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile-edge computing (MEC) technologies have played significant roles in developing a sustainable computing network. In sustainable computing networks, with the increasing scale of data-driven applications, massive privacy-sensitive data are generated. How to effectively process such data on resource-limited IoT devices is challenging. Although edge intelligence (EI) is designed to maintain an appropriate level of ultradelay reliability, low-latency communication (URLLC), real-time data processing, and security and privacy are concerning. In this article, we propose a novel blockchain-supported hierarchical digital twin IoT (HDTIoT) framework, which combines the digital twin to edge network and adopts blockchain technology to achieve secure and reliable real-time computation. We first propose a data and knowledge dual-driven learning solution to ensure real-time interaction and efficient optimization between the physical and the digital worlds. To improve communication and computation efficiency with data and knowledge dual-driven learning, the optimization goal is to minimize the system delay and energy consumption and ensure system reliability and the learning accuracy of IoT devices. Moreover, we propose a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm to solve the resource allocation (RA) problem. Experimental results show that the proposed RA scheme can improve the efficiency of the HDTIoT system, guarantee learning accuracy, reliability, and security, and make a balance between system delay and energy consumption.},

  abstract={In this paper, a novel self-adaptive control method based on a digital twin is developed and investigated for a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear system, which is a heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system. For this purpose, hardware-in-loop (HIL) and software-in-loop (SIL) are integrated to develop the digital twin control concept in a straightforward manner. A nonlinear integral backstepping (NIB) model-free control technique is integrated with the HIL (implemented as a physical controller) and SIL (implemented as a virtual controller) controllers to control the HVAC system without the need for dynamic feature identification. The main goal is to design the virtual controller to minimize the distinction between system outputs in the SIL and HIL setups. For this purpose, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is applied to update the NIB controller coefficients of the virtual controller based on the measured data of the physical controller. Since the temperature and humidity of HVAC systems should be regulated, the NIB controllers in the HIL and SIL are designed by the DRL algorithm in a multi-objective scheme (MO). In particular, the simulations of the HIL and SIL environments are coupled by a new advanced tool: function mockup interface (FMI) standard. The Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) is adopted into the FMI interface for data exchange. The extensive research of HIL and SIL controllers shows that the system outputs of the virtual controller are controlled exactly according to the physical controller.},

  volume={22},

  pages={5231-5247},
  abstract={Software-Defined Vehicular Network (SDVN) is a networking architecture that can provide centralized control for vehicular networks. However, the design for routing policies in SDVNs is generally influenced by several limitations, such as frequent topological changes, complex service requests, and long model training time. Intelligent Digital Twin-based Software-Defined Vehicular Networks (IDT-SDVN) can overcome these weaknesses and maximize the advantages of the conventional SDVN architecture by enabling the controller to construct virtual network spaces and provide virtual instances of corresponding physical objects within the Digital Twin (DT). In this paper, we propose a junction-based hierarchical routing scheme in IDT-SDVN, namely, intelligent digital twin hierarchical (ELITE) routing. The proposed scheme is conducted in four phases: policy training and generation in the virtual network, and deployment and relay selection in physical networks. First, the policy learning phase employs several parallel agents in DT networks and derives multiple single-target policies. Second, the generation phase combines the learned policies and generates new policies based on complex communication requirements. Third, the deployment phase selects the most suitable generated policy according to the real-time network status and message types. A road path is calculated by the controller based on the selected policy and then sent to the requester vehicle. Finally, the relay selection phase is utilized to determine relay vehicles in a hop-by-hop process along the selected path. Simulation results demonstrate that ELITE achieves substantial improvements in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and communication overhead compared with its counterparts.},

  abstract={Recent advances in electronic devices and communication infrastructure have revolutionized the traditional healthcare system into a smart healthcare system by using internet of medical things (IoMT) devices. However, due to the centralized training approach of artificial intelligence (AI), mobile and wearable IoMT devices raise privacy issues concerning the information communicated between hospitals and end-users. The information conveyed by the IoMT devices is highly confidential and can be exposed to adversaries. In this regard, federated learning (FL), a distributive AI paradigm, has opened up new opportunities for privacy preservation in IoMT without accessing the confidential data of the participants. Further, FL provides privacy to end-users as only gradients are shared during training. For these specific properties of FL, in this paper, we present privacy-related issues in IoMT. Afterwards, we present the role of FL in IoMT networks for privacy preservation and introduce some advanced FL architectures by incorporating deep reinforcement learning (DRL), digital twin, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for detecting privacy threats. Moreover, we present some practical opportunities for FL in IoMT. In the end, we conclude this survey by discussing open research issues and challenges while using FL in future smart healthcare systems.},

  pages={2450-2465},
  abstract={Smart home systems are both technologically and economically advancing rapidly. As people become gradually inalienable to smart home infrastructures, their security conditions are getting more and more closely tied to everyone's privacy and safety. In this paper, we consider smart apps, either malicious ones with evil intentions or benign ones with logic errors, that can cause property loss or even physical sufferings to the user when being executed in a smart home environment and interacting with human activities and environmental changes. Unfortunately, current preventive measures rely on permission-based access control, failing to provide ideal protections against such threats due to the nature of their rigid designs. In this paper, we propose CommandFence, a novel digital-twin-based security framework that adopts a fundamentally new concept of protecting the smart home system by letting any sequence of app commands to be executed in a virtual smart home system, in which a deep-q network (DQN) is used to predict if the sequence could lead to a risky consequence. CommandFence is composed of an Interposition Layer to interpose app commands and an Emulation Layer to figure out whether they can cause any risky smart home state if correlating with possible human activities and environmental changes. We fully implemented our CommandFence implementation and tested against 553 official SmartApps on the Samsung SmartThings platform and successfully identified 34 potentially dangerous ones, with 31 of them reported to be problematic Author: Please provide index terms/keywords for your article. To download the IEEE Taxonomy go to http://www.ieee.org/documents/taxonomy_v101.pdf ?> the first time to our best knowledge. Moreover, We tested our CommandFence on the 10 malicious SmartApps created by Jia et al. 2017, and successfully identified 7 of them as risky, with the missed ones actually only causing smartphone information leak (not harmful to the smart home system). We also tested CommandFence against the 17 benign SmartApps with logic errors developed by Celik et al. 2017, and achieved a 100% accuracy. Our experimental studies indicate that adopting CommandFence incurs a neglectable overhead of 0.1675 seconds.},

  abstract={The rapid expansion of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) necessitates the digitization of industrial processes in order to increase network efficiency. The integration of Digital Twin (DT) with IIoT digitizes physical objects into virtual representations to improve data analytics performance. Nevertheless, DT empowered IIoT generates a massive amount of data that is mostly sent to the cloud or edge servers for real-time analysis. However, unreliable public communication channels and lack of trust among participating entities causes various types of threats and attacks on the ongoing communication. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, we present a blockchain and Deep Learning (DL) integrated framework for delivering decentralized data processing and learning in IIoT network. The framework first present a new DT model that facilitates construction of a virtual environment to simulate and replicate security-critical processes of IIoT. Second, we propose a blockchain-based data transmission scheme that uses smart contracts to ensure integrity and authenticity of data. Finally, the DL scheme is designed to apply the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) against valid data retrieved from blockchain. In DL scheme, a Long Short Term Memory-Sparse AutoEncoder (LSTMSAE) technique is proposed to learn the spatial-temporal representation. The extracted characteristics are further used by the proposed Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) algorithm to learn long-distance features and accurately detect attacks. The practical implementation of our proposed framework proves considerable enhancement of communication security and data privacy in DT empowered IIoT network.},

  abstract={For a complex electromechanical product that is a cyber–physical system (CPS), its dynamic behaviors are embodied in the closed-loop control between the logic process in its cyber component and actual actuators/sensors in its physical component, and thus, a well-defined model of the control is important to create a digital twin that acts as much like the real machine as possible. This article proposes a Petri nets (PNs)-based modeling solution that employs hybrid PNs (HPNs) for physics and system of sequential systems with shared resources (S4R) nets for logic in building a hierarchical control model. We also present PNs technologies for implementing a smooth transition and bidirectional mapping from the virtual prototype to the real machine. These technologies involve a PNs integration of a reinforcement learning (RL) method for generating a workflow scheduling agent in design, an extension of PNs definitions that is compatible with the microcontroller for easy deployment in manufacturing, and an architecture of PNs execution recording for data-driven monitoring in service. A software kit is provided for the solution that includes an integrated development environment of PNs, tools for quickly building a virtual prototype, and a monitor server for remote data-driven monitoring. This solution is successfully applied in the development of a typical cyber–physical product case, namely, the chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) analyzer.},

  abstract={The real-time electrical equipment management, such as renewable energy, controllable loads, and storage units, plays a key role in low-carbon operation of smart industrial park. Digital twin (DT), which explores cloud-edge-device collaboration and artificial intelligence to establish accurate digital representation of physical equipment, is a cutting-edge technology to realize intelligent optimization of electrical equipment management. However, the practical implementation still faces reliability and communication efficiency problems, such as adverse impact of electromagnetic interference on DT reliability, high communication cost of DT model training, and uncoordinated resource allocation among cloud, edge, and device layers. We propose a Cloud-edge-device Collaborative reliable and Communication-efficient DT for lOW-carbon electrical equipment management named $\text{C}^{3}$-FLOW. It minimizes the long-term global loss function and time-average communication cost by jointly optimizing device scheduling, channel allocation, and computational resource allocation. Simulation results verify that $\text{C}^{3}$-FLOW performs superior in loss function, communication efficiency, and carbon emission reduction.},

  title={Ubiquitous Control Over Heterogeneous Vehicles: A Digital Twin Empowered Edge AI Approach}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={30},

  pages={166-173},
  abstract={The forthcoming of automated driving has led to vehicular heterogeneity, where vehicles with different automation levels, including connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and human-driven vehicles (HVs), coexist in the road traffic. However, the design of current traffic control systems fail to account for the vehicular traffic heterogeneity. In addition, the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) based traffic control strategies require large quantities of computation resources and generate high delay, which cannot meet the fault-intolerance requirement of the traffic control system. Therefore, there is an urgent need for constructing a new traffic control framework to jointly satisfy the fault-intolerance requirement and realize ubiquitous control over the heterogeneous vehicles. Inspired by this, a digital twin (DT) empowered edge AI framework is proposed in this article. The DT's virtualization capability is utilized to enable virtual risk assessment and performance analysis under the fault-intolerant traffic control system. In addition, the DT's offline learning capability helps the edge AI understand the road traffic data more intelligently to perform enforced optimizations and decisions. Then, a three-layer vehicle control paradigm is discussed under the proposed framework. In the first layer, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is utilized to intelligently control the CAV acceleration and lane-changing. In the second layer, indirect CV/HV control can be performed by adjusting the target speed and penetration rate of the DRL-controlled CAVs which are mixed in the traffic flow. In the third layer, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications and variable message signs are utilized to realize the direct control of CVs and HVs. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed control paradigm.},

  abstract={Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) means to identify fine-grained aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities. Recent ABSA research focuses on utilizing multi-task learning (MTL) to achieve less computational costs and better performance. However, there are certain limits in MTL-based ABSA. For example, unbalanced labels and sub-task learning difficulties may result in the biases that some labels and sub-tasks are overfitting, while the others are underfitting. To address these issues, inspired by neuro-symbolic learning systems, we propose a meta-based self-training method with a meta-weighter (MSM). We believe that a generalizable model can be achieved by appropriate symbolic representation selection (in-domain knowledge) and effective learning control (regulation) in a neural system. Thus, MSM trains a teacher model to generate in-domain knowledge (e.g., unlabeled data selection and pseudo-label generation), where the generated pseudo-labels are used by a student model for supervised learning. Then, the meta-weighter of MSM is jointly trained with the student model to provide each instance with sub-task-specific weights to coordinate their convergence rates, balancing class labels, and alleviating noise impacts introduced from self-training. The following experiments indicate that MSM can utilize 50% labeled data to achieve comparable results to state-of-arts models in ABSA and outperform them with all labeled data.},

  abstract={With the continuous integration of information technology and operation technology, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is gradually changing from closed to open. Operators can configure, monitor, or control the industrial production process remotely via Internet, which brings security threats to IIoTs. Since the IIoT focuses on the availability of industrial production, it is unfeasible to study security issues directly on the industrial field. Thus, constructing an IIoT cyber range to reproduce industrial scenarios for offensive and defensive confrontation research is necessary. However, the traditional IIoT cyber range relies on physical industrial field devices that are not reproducible and hard to recover from cyber-attacks. To solve these problems, in this article, we propose a framework for a digital twin-based cyber range and a digital twin construction method with multiple models. Cyber ranges with digital twins are more flexible and convenient. Based on the proposed method, an industrial scenario is reproduced using machine learning algorithms to predict temperature changes from different perspectives. The experimental result shows the ability of digital twins to construct an IIoT cyber range to reproduce production processes and replace field devices.},

  abstract={Rapid growth of diversity, uncertainty, and coupling effect of units in modern energy systems jointly challenges the traditional model-based situation awareness (SA) in Energy Internet of Things (EIoT). This work explores the digital twin of EIoT (EIoT-DT) and then provides a novel data-driven SA paradigm, named DT-SA, as a promising alternative. Based on the combination of the latest data technologies and machine learning algorithms, DT-SA transfers those stubborn SA challenges to digital space, and then addresses them by building a domain-specific and data-friendly digital twin (DT) model upon massive data. The established model can be quantitatively tested via iterative virtual–real interaction and, thus, be evaluated and updated through closed-loop feedback to improve its performance in the physical world. To this end, some engineering and scientific problems are raised: 1) virtual–real interaction mechanism relevant to resource flow and data flow; 2) unified modeling and analysis of heterogeneous spatial–temporal data; 3) DT configuration and evolution; and 4) domain-specific DT-SA characterization. To solve these problems, cloud-edge-terminal configuration, big data analytics (BDA), DT, and SA indicator systems are studied, respectively. Then, the random matrix theory (RMT) and overarching DT-SA framework are designed as a roadmap. Besides, some potential applications and undergoing projects on the terminal, edge, or cloud are discussed, e.g., condition assessment of equipment, digital monitoring and diagnosis of the power grid network, and EIoT construction in the smart city. Finally, some perspectives and recommendations are proposed in conclusion for future research. This research can be regarded as an efficient handbook for both energy engineering and data science, which may benefit enterprise digitization, smart city, etc.},

  abstract={Federated learning (FL) allows user devices (UDs) to upload local model parameters to participate in a global model training, which protects UDs' data privacy. Nevertheless, FL still faces challenges such as core network congestion, UDs' limited resources and less efficient mapping between devices and cyber systems. Therefore, in this article, we integrate the digital twin (DT) and the mobile edge computing (MEC) technologies into a hierarchical FL framework in the heterogeneous cellular network scenario. When the UDs are not in the service range of the small base stations (SBSs), the framework allows macro base stations to assist UDs' local computation, thus reducing the transmission delay. It also protects the user privacy and allows more users to join in the training in order to improve the FL accuracy. In addition, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based scheme to solve the joint optimization problem of dynamic UDs-stations association and resource allocation, thereby minimizing the energy consumption within a limited time delay. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme not only effectively reduces the task transmission failure rate and energy consumption compared with the baseline scheme, but also saves the communication cost through the DT network.},

  year={2023},
  volume={72},

  pages={1224-1239},
  abstract={Base stations (BSs) are the most energy-consuming segment of mobile networks. To reduce the energy consumption of BSs, inactive components of BSs, with a certain activation/deactivation time, can sleep. In this study, we model the problem of BS energy saving utilizing multiple sleep modes as a sequential MDP and propose an online traffic-aware deep Q-learning approach to maximize the long-term energy saving. However, there is a risk that BS is not sleeping at the right time and incurs delays to the users. To tackle this issue, we propose to use a digital twin model to encapsulate the dynamics underlying the investigated system and estimate the risk of decision-making (RDM) in advance. We define a novel metric to quantify RDM and predict the performance degradation. Mobile operators can compare the RDM with a tolerable threshold to decide on deactivating SMs, re-training, or activating SMs. We trained an agent using real traffic, obtained from an operator's BS in Stockholm. The data-set contains data rate information with very coarse-grained time granularity. Thus, we propose a scheme to generate a new data-set using the real network data-set which 1) has finer-grained time granularity and 2) considers the bursty behavior of traffic data. Simulation results show that using proposed methods, considerable energy saving is obtained at cost of negligible number of delayed users. Moreover, the proposed digital twin model can predict the performance of the DQN proactively in terms of RDM hence preventing the performance degradation in the network in anomalous situations.},

  volume={33},

  pages={793-803},
  abstract={A common challenge posed to robust semantic segmentation is the expensive data annotation cost. Existing semi-supervised solutions show great potential for solving this problem. Their key idea is constructing consistency regularization with unsupervised data augmentation from unlabeled data for model training. The perturbations for unlabeled data enable the consistency training loss, which benefits semi-supervised semantic segmentation. However, these perturbations destroy image context and introduce unnatural boundaries, which is harmful for semantic segmentation. Besides, the widely adopted semi-supervised learning framework, i.e. mean-teacher, suffers performance limitation since the student model finally converges to the teacher model. In this paper, first of all, we propose a context friendly differentiable geometric warping to conduct unsupervised data augmentation; secondly, a novel adversarial dual-student framework is proposed to improve the Mean-Teacher from the following two aspects: (1) dual student models are learned independently except for a stabilization constraint to encourage exploiting model diversities; (2) adversarial training scheme is applied to both students and the discriminators are resorted to distinguish reliable pseudo-label of unlabeled data for self-training. Effectiveness is validated via extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2012 and Cityscapes. Our solution significantly improves the performance and state-of-the-art results are achieved on both datasets. Remarkably, compared with fully supervision, our solution achieves comparable mIoU of 73.4% using only 12.5% annotated data on PASCAL VOC2012.

  abstract={The sixth-generation (6G) wireless network is conceptualized to provide ubiquitous and reliable network access through effective inter-networking among space, air, and terrestrial networks, while posing considerable pressure on dynamic network orchestration. Digital twin (DT) provides an alternative approach to proactively make real-time resource allocation by mapping and learning the complex network topology. However, the dual challenges of limited energy capacity and insufficient computing power of unmanned aerial vehicles make it difficult to establish digital twin on aerial networks. In light of this, in this paper, we propose a lightweight DT empowered air-ground network architecture, where the DT modelling task is distributed to diverse ground devices based on federated learning. To improve the efficiency of DT modelling, we design a distributed incentive mechanism that incentivizes high-performance ground devices to take part in federated learning. Considering the computing burden and possible private disclosure caused by the incentive, we further solve the incentive scheme with a new distributed algorithm. The optimal solution, such as the local training rounds and required accuracy of terminal devices, could be calculated in parallel on ground devices.

  abstract={Advances in modeling and computation have resulted in high-fidelity digital twins capable of simulating the dynamics of a wide range of industrial systems. These simulation models often require calibration, or the estimation of an optimal set of parameters in some goodness-of-fit sense, to reflect a system’s observed behavior. While searching over the parameter space is an inevitable part of the calibration process, simulation models are rarely designed to be valid for arbitrarily large parameter spaces. The application of existing calibration methods, therefore, often results in repeated model evaluations using parameters that can cause the simulations to be impractically slow or even result in catastrophic failure. In general, the shape of subregions in the parameter space that could result in simulation failure is unknown. In this article, we propose a novel failure-robust Bayesian optimization (FR-BO) algorithm that learns these failure regions (FRs) from online simulations and informs a Bayesian optimization algorithm to avoid FRs while optimizing model parameters. This results in acceleration of the optimizer’s convergence and prevents wastage of time trying to simulate parameters with high failure probabilities. The effectiveness of the proposed FR-BO algorithm is demonstrated via a well-known benchmark example where we compare against state-of-the-art gradient matching techniques, and a practical example related to parameter estimation for digital twins of buildings.},

  year={2023},
  volume={33},
  number={5},
  pages={2176-2189},
  abstract={Recently, much attention has been paid to segmenting subtle unknown defect regions by knowledge distillation in an unsupervised setting. Most previous studies concentrated on guiding the student network to learn the same representations on the normality, neglecting the different behaviors of the abnormality. This leads to a high probability of false detection of subtle defects. To address such an issue, we propose to push representations on abnormal areas of the teacher and student network as far as possible while pulling representations on normal areas as close as possible. Based on this idea, we design an efficient teacher-student model for anomaly detection and localization, which maximizes pixel-wise discrepancies for anomalous regions approximated by data augmentation and simultaneously minimizes discrepancies for pixel-wise normal regions between these two networks. The explicit differential knowledge distillation enlarges the margin between normal representations and abnormal ones in favour of discriminating them. Then, the appropriate small student network is not only efficient, but more importantly, helps inhibit the generalization ability of anomalous patterns when learning normal patterns, facilitating the precise decision boundary. The experimental results on the MVTec AD, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better performance than current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Especially, For the MVTec AD dataset with high resolution images, we achieve 98.1 AUROC% and 93.6 AUPRO% in anomaly localization, outperforming knowledge distillation based SOTA methods by 1.1 AUROC% and 1.5 AUPRO% with a lightweight model.},

  abstract={Social media sentiment analysis, which aims to evaluate the attitudes of online users based on their posts, has attracted significant research attention due to its successful application in the field of social media monitoring. It is a beneficial way to utilize multimodal information uploaded by users in order to improve sentiment classification ability. However, existing multimodal fusion-based approaches continue to face difficulties due to the issues of between-modality semantic inconsistency and missing modality. To address these issues, we propose a cross-modal consistency modeling-based knowledge distillation framework for image–text sentiment classification of social media data. Specifically, we design a hybrid curriculum learning strategy to measure the semantic consistency of multimodal data, then gradually train all image–text pairs from easy to hard, which can effectively handle the massive amounts of noise caused by inconsistencies between image and text data on social media. Moreover, in order to alleviate the problem of missing images in unimodal posts, we propose a privileged feature distillation method, in which the teacher model additionally considers images as privileged features, to transfer the visual knowledge to the student model, thereby enhancing the accuracy for text sentiment classification. Extensive experiments conducted over three real-world social media datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed multimodal sentiment analysis model.},

  abstract={The sixth generation (6G) wireless communication aims to enable ubiquitous intelligent connectivity in future space–air–ground–ocean-integrated networks, with extremely low latency and enhanced global coverage. However, the explosive growth in Internet of Things devices poses new challenges for smart devices to process the generated tremendous data with limited resources. In 6G networks, conventional mobile edge computing (MEC) systems encounter serious problems to satisfy the requirements of ubiquitous computing and intelligence, with extremely high mobility, resource limitation, and time variability. In this article, we propose the model of wireless computing power networks (WCPNs), by jointly unifying the computing resources from both end devices and MEC servers. Furthermore, we formulate the new problem of task transfer, to optimize the allocation of computation and communication resources in WCPN. The main objective of task transfer is to minimize the execution latency and energy consumption with respect to resource limitations and task requirements. To solve the formulated problem, we propose a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to find the optimal task transfer and resource allocation strategies. The DRL agents collaborate with others to train a global strategy model through the proposed asynchronous federated aggregation scheme. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can improve computation efficiency, speed up convergence rate, and enhance utility performance.},

  abstract={Virtual reality-embedded digital twin (VR-DT) service integrates digital twin with virtual reality to visualize the digital representation of real-world production, boosting the digital transformation of manufacturing industry in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Balanced against the advantages of the VR-DT service, its data-driven, computing-intensive, and security-sensitive features bring challenges to the current IIoT. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based distributed resource allocation scheme to improve the average Quality of Service (QoS) of the VR-DT services with regard to service delay and transaction throughput. We formulate the joint optimization of channel assignment, subframe configuration, computing capacity allocation, and block size adjustment as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. A fully decentralized multiagent compound-action actor–critic algorithm is developed to solve the QoS optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can efficiently improve the average QoS of the VR-DT services in a realizable way as compared to existing schemes.},

  abstract={For prognostics and health management of industrial systems, machine remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is an essential task. While deep learning-based methods have achieved great successes in RUL prediction tasks, large-scale neural networks are still difficult to deploy on edge devices owing to the constraints of memory capacity and computing power. In this article, we propose a lightweight and adaptive knowledge distillation (KD) framework to alleviate this problem. First, multiple teacher models are compressed into a student model through KD to improve the industrial prediction accuracy. Second, a dynamic exiting method is studied to enable an adaptive inference on the distilled student model. Finally, we develop a reparameterization scheme to further lessen the student network. Experiments on two turbofan engine degradation datasets and a bearing degradation dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods and enables the distilled model with an adaptive inference ability.},

  abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the key technology of Industry 4.0. The combination of machine learning and IIoT has spawned a thriving smart industry. Machine learning models are trained and predicted based on raw data that contains sensitive information, and data sharing leads to information leakage. Data security and privacy protection in IIoT face serious challenges. Therefore, we propose a federated learning-based privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme (FLPDA) for IIoT. Data aggregation to protect individual user model changes in federated learning against reverse analysis attacks from industry administration centers. Each round of data aggregation uses the PBFT consensus algorithm to select an IIoT device from the aggregation area as the initialization and aggregation node. Paillier cryptosystem and secret sharing are combined to realize data fault tolerance and secure sharing. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that the scheme can effectively protect data privacy and resist various attacks. It has lower communication, computational, and storage overhead than existing schemes.},

  volume={32},
  number={},
  pages={116-127},
  abstract={While deep models have proved successful in learning rich knowledge from massive well-annotated data, they may pose a privacy leakage risk in practical deployment. It is necessary to find an effective trade-off between high utility and strong privacy. In this work, we propose a discriminative-generative distillation approach to learn privacy-preserving deep models. Our key idea is taking models as bridge to distill knowledge from private data and then transfer it to learn a student network via two streams. First, discriminative stream trains a baseline classifier on private data and an ensemble of teachers on multiple disjoint private subsets, respectively. Then, generative stream takes the classifier as a fixed discriminator and trains a generator in a data-free manner. After that, the generator is used to generate massive synthetic data which are further applied to train a variational autoencoder (VAE). Among these synthetic data, a few of them are fed into the teacher ensemble to query labels via differentially private aggregation, while most of them are embedded to the trained VAE for reconstructing synthetic data. Finally, a semi-supervised student learning is performed to simultaneously handle two tasks: knowledge transfer from the teachers with distillation on few privately labeled synthetic data, and knowledge enhancement with tangent-normal adversarial regularization on many triples of reconstructed synthetic data. In this way, our approach can control query cost over private data and mitigate accuracy degradation in a unified manner, leading to a privacy-preserving student model. Extensive experiments and analysis clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={The sixth generation (6G) is conceived to address the expected high level of requirements (such as ultra-high-data-transmission rate, support for the highest moving speed and seamless connection, etc.) in the next decade and beyond. In the context of 6G, a large number of Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) (IIoT) devices may access the network, and thanks to the rapid development of artificial intelligence make smart manufacturing has the opportunity to be realized. However, a large number of IoT devices, the tremendous volume of data, the heterogeneous nature of devices, and the increasing concerns of privacy challenge the efficient management and quality of services in IIoT. To address these problems, in this article, a device-to-device (D2D) communication-aided digital twin edge network is proposed, where edge computing is introduced to bring computing and storage resources near to the end devices, and digital twin is utilized to fill the gap between physical and virtual space and D2D communication is applied to assist resource limited IoT devices to achieve normal communication. Moreover, digital twin-empowered federated reinforcement learning is leveraged to provide privacy awareness and decentralized resource allocation strategy training on D2D communication links to further improve network performance.

Situation awareness (SA) has been proposed to ensure the stable operation for IoE and making full use of the relationships between components has become the key point for designing an efficient SA model. In this article, graph digital twin (GDT) is proposed by combining digital twin technology with graph theory, to describe the logical relationships between physical entities more accurately in digital space, and then a novel SA model for IoE based on GDT is proposed. In order to make full use of the relationship between nodes, two classifiers based on graph convolution network are designed for fault location and stability prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed SA model can localize the multiple fault components with high accuracy, and can accurately predict the stability of the system.},

  abstract={Digital twinning and edge computing are attractive solutions to support computing-intensive and service-sensitive Internet of Vehicles applications. Most of the existing Internet of Vehicles service offloading solutions only consider edge-cloud collaboration, but the collaboration between small cell eNodeB (SCeNB) should not be ignored. Service delays far lower than offloading tasks to the cloud can be obtained through reasonable collaborative computing between nodes. The proposed framework realizes and maintains the simulation of collaboration between SCeNB nodes by constructing a digital twin that maintains SCeNB nodes in the central controller, thereby realizing user task offloading positions, sub-channel allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then an algorithm named AUC-AC is proposed, based on the dominant actor-critic network and the auction mechanism. In order to obtain a better command of global information, the convolutional block attention mechanism (CBAM) is used in the digital twin of each SCeNB node to observe its environment and learn strategies. Numerical results show that our experimental scheme is better than several baseline algorithms in terms of service delay.},

More specifically, a real-time general machine-learning-based architecture for sensor validation is proposed, built upon a series of neural-network estimators and a classifier. Estimators correspond to virtual sensors of all unreliable sensors (to reconstruct normal behavior and replace the isolated faulty sensor within the system), whereas the classifier is used for detection and isolation tasks.

  abstract={With the development of IoT, virtual reality, cloud computing, and digital twin technologies, the advent of metaverse has attracted increasing world attention. Metaverse integrates and applies multiple emerging technologies to cloud education, smart health, digital government, and emergency evacuation. Evacuation systems are of great importance to ensure life safety. Due to panic, people in a building may not be able to make the right judgment to choose an optimal path to leave the building in case of an emergency event such as a fire. As a branch of machine learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can model an evacuation scene, collect real-time information, such as crowd distribution and disaster location, find the optimal escape path with a path-planning algorithm, induce the movement state of the crowd through dynamic guidance signs, and improve the evacuation efficiency. In this article, we apply DRL technology to solve the efficient emergency evacuation problem with the help of metaverse and show a training system built upon metaverse that would enable evacuees to choose the most efficient route and leave the building in the least amount of time. The information collected by various sensors, such as video cameras and smoke detectors, can give a whole picture of the status of the building in a real-time manner. The collected data are processed by cloud servers in which a DRL model is trained to dynamically guide evacuees. Experiments in different simulation scenes demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the traditional static guidance method in saving evacuation time. It can effectively avoid major crowding along the evacuation route and improve evacuation efficiency.},

  abstract={Data centres are becoming an increasingly important part of our society’s infrastructure. The number of data centres is growing constantly, making growing the gross level of electrical energy consumption.

But for this, new advanced technologies must be applied to solve the problems of complexity and heterogeneity in various types of data centre design. A new concept, which is based on the automated generation of a digital twin (DT) system, directly from its schematic representation is presented in this paper. A DT is a virtual version of an object or system, designed to aid decision-making and virtual commissioning through simulation, machine learning, and reasoning. In the scope of current work, the IEC 61850 standard is chosen as a starting point for a multi-step generation of the DT combining simulation model and decentralized control logic. As a result, the designed DT “clone” of an electrical system consists of the SIMULINK model of the electrical system plus the automatically generated control application (based on the IEC 61499 standard).},

  abstract={Natural language BERTs are trained with language corpus in a self-supervised manner.

We propose a self-training approach that allows training VL-BERTs from unlabeled image data. The proposed method starts with our unified conditional model– a vision language BERT model that can perform zero-shot conditional generation. Given different conditions, the unified conditional model can generate captions, dense captions, and even questions. We use the labeled image data to train a teacher model and use the trained model to generate pseudo captions on unlabeled image data. We then combine the labeled data and pseudo labeled data to train a student model. The process is iterated by putting the student model as a new teacher. By using the proposed self-training approach and only 300k unlabeled extra data, we are able to get competitive or even better performances compared to the models of similar model size trained with 3 million extra image data.},

  abstract={Accurate and robust 6-DOF (6D) pose estimation from a single RGB image and depth map (RGB-D) image is an essential task of intelligent manufacturing, such as robot assembly and digital twin. However, incomplete and noisy 3-D data acquired from depth sensors make the task challenging, especially for various industrial parts without sufficient textures, where the occlusion further exacerbates the problem. To tackle this issue, this article proposes a geometry-enhanced network with incomplete shape recovery (GER-Net) to estimate the 6D pose of industrial parts. First, an incomplete 3-D shape recovery (ISR) module with a learnable shape protection (SP) layer is introduced to recover the complete 3-D geometry shapes of raw point clouds obtained from depth measurements. Subsequently, the multimodal features extracted from raw RGB-D data are enhanced with the geometry information from the recovered point cloud via multiscale concatenation and recurrent forward fusion in the point cloud space. In this way, the enhanced RGB-D representations contribute to the regression of accurate 6D pose. Experiments on two popular benchmark datasets (LineMOD and Occlusion-LineMOD) show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, a real-world low-texture industrial part dataset industrial texture-less machined and 3-D-printed parts (ITM3D) is presented to fully validate the effectiveness of our method, where it also achieves the best performance with remarkable accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract={An efficient serving of predictive management and what-if-analysis of smart cities is the only way to achieve a net-zero waste target. With the aid of the enhanced learning capabilities of digital twin, net-zero aims of smart cities can be obtained with highly accurate results in the prediction of waste-to-energy and candidate truck paths. However, there is no unified communication model yet for a digital twin to maintain complete data and control flow in a fully synchronized way. Without having a clear communication model for the digital twin, the interaction between the physical and digital replica cannot be sustained. To handle this, we propose a digital twin networking framework called T6CONF, based on an IPv6 infrastructure, to solve the end-to-end two-way communication and synchronization problem of the resource-constrained Internet of Things networks. Besides, T6CONF serves two specific net-zero waste services, waste-to-energy and planned-truck-routing prediction services, for the net-zero goal. We evaluate the proposed digital twin communication model with changing fidelity levels over the twinning rate and round-trip time. Additionally, we prove that the proposed T6CONF model increases the accuracy of service layer operations.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) has emerged as an enabling technology for the sixth generation (6G) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. However, there are two crucial issues on leveraging DT for 6G V2X communications. First, what kind of DT capabilities can be combined with the 6G V2X networks? Second, how to transform the DT capabilities into the practical V2X network performance gain? Motivated to solve these problems, this article investigates the DT capabilities under a DT and mobile edge computing empowered 6G V2X network architecture. Specifically, three DT capabilities are presented: (1) Strengthening the human-machine interaction via driving behavior analysis; (2) Improving the traffic safety via knowledge-based vehicle fault diagnosis; (3) Analyzing the spatial-temporal traffic characteristics via data aggregation. Furthermore, we investigate two case studies for illustrating how the DT capabilities can be utilized to perform the task-efficiency oriented V2X network scheduling. In the first case study, the driver behavior analysis result is combined with the V2X channel scheduling strategy. In the second case study, a deep reinforcement learning based vehicle merging decision is devised in the DT domain. Then, a coalition based V2X channel scheduling strategy is proposed to help accomplish the vehicle merging decision task. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed task-efficiency oriented V2X channel scheduling schemes and highlight the future research directions.},

  year={2023},
  volume={19},

  pages={7247-7257},
  abstract={To meet the fairly high safety and reliability requirements in practice, the state of health (SOH) estimation of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which has a close relationship with the degradation performance, has been extensively studied with the widespread applications of various electronics. The conventional SOH estimation approaches with digital twin are end-of-cycle estimation that require the completion of a full charge/discharge cycle to observe the maximum available capacity. However, under dynamic operating conditions with partially discharged data, it is impossible to sense accurate real-time SOH estimation for LIBs. To bridge this research gap, we put forward a digital twin framework to gain the capability of sensing the battery's SOH on the fly, updating the physical battery model. The proposed digital twin solution consists of three core components to enable real-time SOH estimation without requiring a complete discharge. First, to handle the variable training cycling data, the energy discrepancy-aware cycling synchronization is proposed to align cycling data with guaranteeing the same data structure. Second, to explore the temporal importance of different training sampling times, a time-attention SOH estimation model is developed with data encoding to capture the degradation behavior over cycles, excluding adverse influences of unimportant samples. Finally, for online implementation, a similarity analysis-based data reconstruction has been put forward to provide real-time SOH estimation without requiring a full discharge cycle. Through a series of results conducted on a widely used benchmark, the proposed method yields the real-time SOH estimation with errors less than 1$\%$ for most sampling times in ongoing cycles.},

  abstract={Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs), as the crucial support of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), have received great attention in recent years. With the rapid development of VANETs, various services have generated a great deal of data that can be used for transportation planning and safe driving. Especially, with the advent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the transportation system has been impacted, thus novel modes of transportation planning and intelligent applications are necessary. Digital twins can provide powerful support for artificial intelligence applications in Transportation Big Data (TBD). The features of VANETs are varying, which arises the main challenge of digital twins applying in TBD. Network traffic prediction, as part of digital twins, is useful for network management and security in VANETs, such as network planning and anomaly detection. This paper proposes a network traffic prediction algorithm aiming at time-varying traffic flows with a large number of fluctuations. This algorithm combines Deep Q-Learning (DQN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for network traffic feature extraction. DQN is leveraged to carry out network traffic prediction, in which GAN is involved to represent Q-network. Meanwhile, the generative network can increase the number of samples to improve the prediction error. We evaluate the performance of our method by implementing it on three real network traffic data sets. Finally, we compare the two state-of-the-art competing methods with our method.},

  abstract={With the high flexibility of supporting resource-intensive and time-sensitive applications, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) is proposed as an innovational paradigm to support the mobile users (MUs). As a promising technology, digital twin (DT) is capable of timely mapping the physical entities to virtual models, and reflecting the MEC network state in real-time. In this paper, we first propose an MEC network with multiple movable UAVs and one DT-empowered ground base station to enhance the MEC service for MUs. Considering the limited energy resource of both MUs and UAVs, we formulate an online problem of resource scheduling to minimize the weighted energy consumption of them. To tackle the difficulty of the combinational problem, we formulate it as a Markov decision process (MDP) with multiple types of agents. Since the proposed MDP has huge state space and action space, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) with Beta distribution and attention mechanism to pursue the optimal computation offloading policy. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme is able to efficiently reduce the energy consumption and outperforms the benchmarks in performance, convergence speed and utilization of resources.},

A Transformer-based modeling method for radio over fiber (RoF) link is developed and experimentally demonstrated, in which the Transformer is a kind of deep learning network. The modeling performance of the constructed model by using the proposed method is evaluated, which is better than the ones based on fully connected neural network (FCNN), convolution neural network (CNN), and generative adversarial network (GAN). In addition, the modeling consistency with different laser launch power, fiber length, carrier frequency, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is also investigated. Experimental results show that the fitting waveforms predicted by the proposed method agree well with the actual waveforms at the receiver end.

  abstract={Practical applications ask for object detection models that achieve high performance at low overhead. Knowledge distillation demonstrates favorable potential in this case by transferring knowledge from a cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight student model. However, previous distillation methods are plagued with massive misleading background information in remote sensing images and ignore investigating the relationships between different instances. In this article, we propose an instance-aware distillation (InsDist for short) method to derive efficient remote sensing object detectors. Our InsDist combines feature-based and relation-based knowledge distillation to make the most of instance-related information in the knowledge transfer from the teacher to the student. On one hand, we propose a parameter-free masking module to decouple instance-related foreground from instance-irrelevant background in multiscale features. On the other hand, we construct the relationships between different instances to enhance the learning of intraclass compactness and interclass dispersion. The student comprehensively imitates both features and relationships from the teacher, yielding considerable effectiveness in dealing with complex remote sensing images. In addition, our InsDist can be easily built on mainstream object detectors with negligible extra cost. Extensive experiments on two large-scale remote sensing object detection datasets, namely DIOR and DOTA, show that our InsDist obtains noticeable gains over other distillation methods for both one-stage and two-stage, as well as both anchor-based and anchor-free detectors. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/swift1988/InsDist.},

  abstract={This paper describes a method for distilling a recurrent-based sequence-to-sequence (S2S) voice conversion (VC) model. Although the performance of recent VCs is becoming higher quality, streaming conversion is still a challenge when considering practical applications. To achieve streaming VC, the conversion model needs a streamable structure, a causal layer rather than a non-causal layer. Motivated by this constraint and recent advances in S2S learning, we apply the teacher-student framework to recurrent-based S2S- VC models. A major challenge is how to minimize degradation due to the use of causal layers which masks future input information. Experimental evaluations show that except for male-to-female speaker conversion, our approach is able to maintain the teacher model's performance in terms of subjective evaluations despite the streamable student model structure.

  abstract={Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) have the potential to become providers of frequency regulation services in future energy systems. In this case, the reliable operation of BESS has a significant impact on system stability. One of the tools that ensures the secure BESS operation is applying a digital twin to forecast the BESS state of charge (SOC). It allows to predict BESS behavior and identify potential failures or cyberattacks in BESS. In this article, we compare multiple data-driven approaches to forecast the SOC of a BESS based on realistic dataset and real battery operation. Recurrent neural networks, e.g., feedforward neural network, gated recurrent unit, long short-term memory, support vector regression, random forest, and AdaBoost methods are applied to evaluate each method's performance. We compare the methods based on the maximum and average forecast errors, the required computational capacity, as well as expected training speed. To validate the results, in addition to the data gathered from simulations, we used experimental setup with a BESS of 79 kWh providing containment reserve for normal operation, which is a BESS service with a high economical potential in Nordic Region. Furthermore, we provide recommendations for the methods that are suitable to be applied for modeling the digital twin of a utility-scale battery digital twin.},

  abstract={With recent advances in information and communication technology (ICT), the bleeding edge concept of digital twin (DT) has enticed the attention of many researchers to revolutionize the entire modern industries. DT concept refers to a digital representation of a physical entity that is able to reflect its physical behavior by applying platforms and bidirectional interaction of data in real-time. The remarkable deployment of the internet of things in the power grid has led to reliable access to information that improves its performance and equips it with a powerful tool for real-time data management and analysis. This paper aims to trace the continuous investigation and propose practical ideas in originating and developing DT technology, according to various application domains of power systems, and also describes the proposed solutions to deal with the challenges associated with DT. Indeed, with the development of modern cities, different energy layers such as transportation systems, smart grids, and microgrids have emerged facing various issues that challenge the multi-dimensional energy management system. For example, in transportation systems, traffic is a major problem that requires real-time management, planning, and analysis. In power grids, remote data transfer within the grid and also various analyzes needing real data are just some of the current challenges in the field. These problems can be cracked by providing and analyzing a real twin framework in each section. All in all, this paper aims to survey different applications of DT in the development of the various aspects of energy management within a city including transportation systems, power grids, and microgrids. Besides, the security of DT technology based on ML is discussed. It also provides a complete view for the readers to be able to develop and deploy a DT technology for various power system applications.},

  abstract={The industrial visual sensing-actuation system is an implementation approach to construct the loop between the digital twin and physical systems, which is facing the following challenges. First, the cross-digital-physical information exchanges bring a high end-to-end delay that threatens the functional safety of industrial systems. Second, industrial scenarios are diverse, such as manufacturing, chemical engineering, etc., which makes the intelligent sensing strategies for one scenario inapplicable to others, especially for few-shot cases. Third, intelligent actuation strategies cannot allocate resources across digital and physical domains. We propose the delay-minimization-based intelligent digital twin approach to address the above challenges. The digital twin framework incorporates samples from the physical domain to train the learning models in the digital domain. The proposed scheme tailors and adapts transferable and reinforced learning models with end-to-end delay analysis to optimize the training process. The feasibility and efficiency of the scheme are validated by simulations.},

  abstract={We consider a new problem of few-shot learning of com-pact models. Meta-learning is a popular approach for few-shot learning. Previous work in meta-learning typically assumes that the model architecture during meta-training is the same as the model architecture used for final deployment. In this paper, we challenge this basic assumption. For final deployment, we often need the model to be small. But small models usually do not have enough capacity to effectively adapt to new tasks. In the mean time, we often have access to the large dataset and extensive computing power during meta-training since meta-training is typically per-formed on a server. In this paper, we propose task-specific meta distillation that simultaneously learns two models in meta-learning: a large teacher model and a small student model. These two models are jointly learned during meta-training. Given a new task during meta-testing, the teacher model is first adapted to this task, then the adapted teacher model is used to guide the adaptation of the student model. The adapted student model is used for final deployment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in few-shot image classification using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). Our proposed method outperforms other alternatives on several benchmark datasets.},

  abstract={Rapid dissemination of misinformation is a major societal problem receiving increasing attention. Unlike Deep-fake, Out-of-Context misinformation, in which the unaltered unimode contents (e.g. image, text) of a multi-modal news sample are combined in an out-of-context manner to generate deception, requires limited technical expertise to create. Therefore, it is more prevalent a means to confuse readers. Most existing approaches extract features from its uni-mode counterparts to concatenate and train a model for the misinformation classification task. In this paper, we design a self-supervised feature representation learning strategy that aims to attain the multi-task objectives: (1) task-agnostic, which evaluates the intra- and inter-mode representational consistencies for improved alignments across related models; (2) task-specific, which estimates the category-specific multi-modal knowledge to enable the classifier to derive more discriminative predictive distributions. To compensate for the dearth of annotated data representing varied types of misinformation, the proposed Self-Supervised Distilled Learner (SSDL) utilizes a Teacher network to weakly guide a Student network to mimic a similar decision pattern as the teacher. The two-phased learning of SSDL can be summarized as: initial pretraining of the Student model using a combination of contrastive self-supervised task-agnostic objective and supervised task-specific adjustment in parallel; finetuning the Student model via self-supervised knowledge distillation blended with the supervised objective of decision alignment. In addition to the consistent out-performances over the existing baselines that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, the explainability capacity of the proposed SSDL also helps users visualize the reasoning behind a specific prediction made by the model.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation which learns a lightweight student model by distilling knowledge from a cumbersome teacher model is an attractive approach for learning compact deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent works further improve student network performance by leveraging multiple teacher networks. However, most of the existing knowledge distillation-based multi-teacher methods use separately pretrained teachers. This limits the collaborative learning between teachers and the mutual learning between teachers and student. Network quantization is another attractive approach for learning compact DNNs. However, most existing network quantization methods are developed and evaluated without considering multi-teacher support to enhance the performance of quantized student model. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages both multi-teacher knowledge distillation and network quantization for learning low bit-width DNNs. The proposed method encourages both collaborative learning between quantized teachers and mutual learning between quantized teachers and quantized student. During learning process, at corresponding layers, knowledge from teachers will form an importance-aware shared knowledge which will be used as input for teachers at subsequent layers and also be used to guide student. Our experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets show that the compact quantized student models trained with our method achieve competitive results compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and in some cases, surpass the full precision models.},

The proposed AttTrack framework has three key components: 1) cross-model feature learning to align intermediate representations from the teacher and student models, 2) interleaving the execution of the two models at inference time, and 3) incorporating the updated predictions from the teacher model as prior knowledge to assist the student model. Experiments on pedestrian tracking tasks are conducted on the MOT17 and MOT15 datasets using two different object detection backbones YOLOv5 and DLA34 show that AttTrack can significantly improve student model tracking performance while sacrificing only minor degradation of tracking speed.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation is a process of distilling information from a large model with significant knowledge capacity (teacher) to enhance a smaller model (student). Therefore, exploring the properties of the teacher is the key to improving student performance (e.g., teacher decision boundaries). One decision boundary exploring technique is to leverage adversarial attack methods, which add crafted perturbations within a ball constraint to clean inputs to create attack examples of the teacher called adversarial examples. These adversarial examples are informative examples because they are near decision boundaries. In this paper, we formulate a teacher adversarial local distribution, a set of all adversarial examples within the ball constraint given an input. This distribution is used to sufficiently explore the decision boundaries of the teacher by covering the full spectrum of possible teacher model perturbations. The student model is then regularized by matching the loss between teacher and student using these adversarial example inputs. We conducted a number of experiments on CIFAR-100 and Imagenet datasets to illustrate this teacher adversarial local distribution regularization (TALD) can be applied to improve performance of many existing knowledge distillation methods (e.g., KD, FitNet, CRD, VID, FT, etc.).},

  abstract={Network slicing (NS) provides customized services to users of the Internet of Things (IoT) by creating logical virtual networks, and NS combined with multiaccess edge computing (MEC) can significantly minimize the latency for delay-sensitive service. Therefore, it is important to research how to employ NS to achieve low latency for delay-sensitive service in MEC-enabled IoT. In this article, we propose a paradigm of dynamic cooperative slicing based on the digital twin network (DTN) to achieve low latency for delay-sensitive service. Specifically, we first build a DTN for the MEC-enabled IoT, and build basic models and function models, including prediction and decision making in DTN. Then, we realize dynamic cooperative slicing through the built basic models and function models. Second, with the assistance of the ubiquitous computing resources in MEC-enabled IoT based on DTN, we construct joint optimization problem of communication resources, computing resources, and collaboration proportion with the objective of ensuring low delay of delay-sensitive service while maximizing the long-term utility of operators. Third, considering that the different MEC servers participating in the cooperation in each time slot lead to different action spaces in different time slots, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm with variable action space, called VADDPG, which draws on the idea of action masking and introduces the action adjustor to realize the hard control of action space. Finally, a large number of simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithms in terms of both the long-term utility of operators and the delay obtained by slicing.},

  abstract={Current deep learning-assisted brain tumor classification models sustain inductive bias and parameter dependency problems for extracting texture-based image information. Thereby concerning these problems, the recent development of the vision transformer model has substituted the DL model for classification tasks. However, the high performance of the vision transformer model depends on a large-scale dataset as well as self-attention calculations between the number of image patches which result in a quadratic computational complexity. To address these problems, the vision transformer must be data-efficient to be well-trained with a limited amount of data, and the computational complexity must be linear with the number of image patches. Consequently, this paper presents a novel linear-complexity data-efficient image transformer called LCDEiT for training with small-size datasets by using a teacher-student strategy and linear computational complexity concerning the number of patches using an external attention mechanism. The teacher model comprised a custom gated-pooled convolutional neural network to provide knowledge to the transformer-based student model for the classification of MRI brain tumors. The average classification accuracy and F1-score for two benchmark datasets including Figshare and BraTS-21 are found 98.11% and 97.86% and 93.69% and 93.68% respectively. The results indicate that the proposed model could have a great impact on medical imaging-based diagnosis where data availability and faster computations are the main concern.},

  abstract={To meet the stringent service requirements of 6G applications such as immersive cloud eXtended Reality (XR), holographic communication, and digital twin, there is no doubt that an increasing number of servers will be deployed on the network edge. Then, the techniques, edge computing, edge caching, and edge intelligence will be more widely utilized for intelligent local data storage and processing generated by 6G applications, while innovative access network architecture based on the cloud-edge servers, such as the Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) will be adopted to improve the flexibility and openness for new service deployment and frequent network changes. On the other hand, new attack surfaces and vectors targeting local infrastructure and users will emerge along with the deployment of novel network architecture and techniques. Massive researchers have studied the potential security and privacy threats on the 6G network edge as well as the countermeasures. The three techniques, edge computing, edge caching, and edge intelligence have become a double-edged sword that can not only be synchronously utilized to develop defense countermeasures, but also become the targets of many new security and privacy threats. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of articles on the three techniques-related security threats and countermeasures on the 6G network edge. We explain how security and privacy can be destroyed by attacking one of the three technologies and how the three services support each other to realize efficient and achievable security protection. Moreover, the researches on the benefits and limitations of Federated Learning (FL) and blockchain for decentralized edge network systems in terms of security and privacy are also investigated. Additionally, we also analyze the existing challenges and future directions towards 6G.},

  year={2023},
  volume={72},
  number={7},
  pages={8354-8368},
  abstract={This paper considers the cooperative search for stationary targets by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited sensing range and communication ability in a dynamic threatening environment. The main purpose is to use multiple UAVs to find more unknown targets as soon as possible, increase the coverage rate of the mission area, and more importantly, guide UAVs away from threats. However, traditional search methods are mostly unscalable and perform poorly in dynamic environments. A new multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) method, DNQMIX, is proposed in this study to solve the multi-UAV cooperative target search (MCTS) problem. The reward function is also newly designed for the MCTS problem to guide UAVs to explore and exploit the environment information more efficiently. Moreover, this paper proposes a digital twin (DT) driven training framework “centralized training, decentralized execution, and continuous evolution” (CTDECE). It can facilitate the continuous evolution of MADRL models and solve the tradeoff between training speed and environment fidelity when MADRL is applied to real-world multi-UAV systems. Simulation results show that DNQMIX outperforms state-of-art methods in terms of search rate and coverage rate.},

  abstract={Wearable data mining on the edge is essential for consumer electronics and providing real-time insights to the users. However, the challenge lies in the high computing complexity and energy consumption of the algorithms, especially the advanced deep neural networks. Focusing on this challenge, we in this research have proposed a deep knowledge distillation learning algorithm to achieve a light-weight edge-deployable deep learning model. We take a special interest in the Electrocardiogram-based cardiac disease detection application. More specifically, we have firstly designed a heavy teacher model for cardiac disease detection. We then have leveraged the soft target distribution of the teacher model to supervise the training of a lightweight student model. In such a way, the student model can learn the knowledge from the teacher model, with an energy-efficient structure that has significantly less parameters. Evaluated on the cardiac disease detection task, our framework has demonstrated promising effectiveness, and this study will therefore greatly advance efficient wearable data mining on the edge in consumer electronics.},

  abstract={A digital twin (DT) is an electronic replica of a real-world item. It is built on top of asset-specific data items and is often enhanced using semantic technologies and simulation environments. The DT lays the way for anything from routine monitoring to hands-off administration of a physical entity. With the development of the metaverse concept of DT gains importance. As it helps to manage the physical entity in the metaverse. Therefore, it is beneficial to use DT for the detection and mitigation of different types of cyber attacks. In this context, we use the concept of DT for the identification and detection of DDoS attacks in the IoT network. Our proposed approach uses the concept of support vector machine (SVM) learning technique for the identification and detection of DDoS attacks. In our proposed approach, the DT of physical routers is stored in the metaverse, which makes it secure against any type of physical attack. Our proposed approach detected the malicious packets with an accuracy of 93.25% accuracy.},

  volume={25},

  pages={9096-9107},
  abstract={Deep hashing has proven to be efficient and effective for large-scale face retrieval. However, existing hashing methods are designed for normal face images only. They fail to consider the fact that face images may be occluded because of wearing masks, hats, glasses, etc. Retrieval performance of existing face retrieval methods is much worse when dealing with occluded face images. In this work, we propose the knowledge distillation hashing (KDH) to deal with occluded face images. The KDH is a two-stage learning approach with teacher-student model distillation. We first train a teacher hashing network using normal face images and then the knowledge from teacher model is used to guide the optimization of the student model using occluded face images as input only. With knowledge distillation, we build a connection between imperfect face information and the optimal hash codes. Experimental results show that the KDH yields significant improvements and better retrieval performance in comparison to existing state-of-the-art deep hashing retrieval methods under six different face occlusion situations.},

  abstract={Intelligent machine fault diagnosis technique has recently exploded interest in digital health, energy power, and industrial maintenance. Collecting machine fault data in engineering practice is usually costly, causing big challenges in the intelligent diagnosis of most fresh-from-the-factory machines that are missing fault data. Inspired by the main idea of the digital twin, in this article, we propose a dynamic model-embedded intelligent machine fault diagnosis framework. Specifically, a machine dynamic modeling and parameter identification approach is introduced for building the machine digital model. The digital model is used to predict machine fault data from the measured healthy vibration signals. Furthermore, a parameterized convolutional neural network structure is designed for learning optimization features and recognizing the machine's healthy state. Experimental investigation demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework. The results show that the proposed framework enables intelligent machine fault diagnosis without fault data. The diagnosis effect outperforms supervised, unsupervised, and small-sample learning approaches and can be generalized to another load and speed with acceptable accuracy.},

  abstract={With the recent advances of the Internet of Things (IoT), innovative techniques, and concepts have emerged, such as digital twins and industrial 4.0. As one of the essential parts of a digital twin, IoT-based smart predictive maintenance (IoT-SPM) is a key enabling technology for smart manufacturing. This article introduces digital twins and their relationship to IoT-SPM and proposes a reference IoT-SPM, aiming to provide a comprehensive and systematic outlook for the IoT-SPM field. Thus, it can be used as a guide map for interested readers. To give a complete picture of the IoT-SPM ecosystem in industrial 4.0 systems, this article conducts an analysis from multiview perspectives, starting with the architecture, followed by platforms and component. The key components or requirements of an IoT-SPM ecosystem are identified and outlined, including the IoT and cyber–physical system (CPS) as the cornerstone technologies, IoT monitoring data as the base, big data platforms as the backbone, an upgraded computing paradigm as the catalyst, and machine learning-based data analysis as the main processor. This article also focuses on the issues surrounding IoT data when applying analytic models to a real-world industrial IoT system. Then, the current progresses relating IoT and IoT-SPM are depicted, and a research gap on IoT data quality is identified.

  year={2023},
  volume={42},
  number={8},
  pages={2189-2199},
  abstract={Deep learning based image enhancement models have largely improved the readability of fundus images in order to decrease the uncertainty of clinical observations and the risk of misdiagnosis. However, due to the difficulty of acquiring paired real fundus images at different qualities, most existing methods have to adopt synthetic image pairs as training data. The domain shift between the synthetic and the real images inevitably hinders the generalization of such models on clinical data. In this work, we propose an end-to-end optimized teacher-student framework to simultaneously conduct image enhancement and domain adaptation. The student network uses synthetic pairs for supervised enhancement, and regularizes the enhancement model to reduce domain-shift by enforcing teacher-student prediction consistency on the real fundus images without relying on enhanced ground-truth. Moreover, we also propose a novel multi-stage multi-attention guided enhancement network (MAGE-Net) as the backbones of our teacher and student network. Our MAGE-Net utilizes multi-stage enhancement module and retinal structure preservation module to progressively integrate the multi-scale features and simultaneously preserve the retinal structures for better fundus image quality enhancement. Comprehensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms the baseline approaches. Moreover, our method also benefits the downstream clinical tasks.},

  abstract={This article compares two state-of-the-art text input techniques between non-stationary virtual reality (VR) and video see-through augmented reality (VST AR) use-cases as XR display condition. The developed contact-based mid-air virtual tap and word-gesture (swipe) keyboard provide established support functions for text correction, word suggestions, capitalization, and punctuation. A user evaluation with 64 participants revealed that XR displays and input techniques strongly affect text entry performance, while subjective measures are only influenced by the input techniques. We found significantly higher usability and user experience ratings for tap keyboards compared to swipe keyboards in both VR and VST AR. Task load was also lower for tap keyboards. In terms of performance, both input techniques were significantly faster in VR than in VST AR. Further, the tap keyboard was significantly faster than the swipe keyboard in VR. Participants showed a significant learning effect with only ten sentences typed per condition. Our results are consistent with previous work in VR and optical see-through (OST) AR, but additionally provide novel insights into usability and performance of the selected text input techniques for VST AR. The significant differences in subjective and objective measures emphasize the importance of specific evaluations for each possible combination of input techniques and XR displays to provide reusable, reliable, and high-quality text input solutions. With our work, we form a foundation for future research and XR workspaces. Our reference implementation is publicly available to encourage replicability and reuse in future XR workspaces.},

  title={Digital Twin-Based Cyber-Attack Detection Framework for Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Systems}, 
  year={2023},

  pages={1-18},
  abstract={Smart manufacturing (SM) systems utilize run-time data to improve productivity via intelligent decision-making and analysis mechanisms on both machine and system levels. The increased adoption of cyber-physical systems in SM leads to the comprehensive framework of cyber-physical manufacturing systems (CPMS) where data-enabled decision-making mechanisms are coupled with cyber-physical resources on the plant floor. Due to their cyber-physical nature, CPMS are susceptible to cyber-attacks that may cause harm to the manufacturing system, products, or even the human workers involved in this context. Therefore, detecting cyber-attacks efficiently and timely is a crucial step toward implementing and securing high-performance CPMS in practice. This paper addresses two key challenges to CPMS cyber-attack detection. The first challenge is distinguishing expected anomalies in the system from cyber-attacks. The second challenge is the identification of cyber-attacks during the transient response of CPMS due to closed-loop controllers. Digital twin (DT) technology emerges as a promising solution for providing additional insights into the physical process (twin) by leveraging run-time data, models, and analytics. In this work, we propose a DT framework for detecting cyber-attacks in CPMS during controlled transient behavior as well as expected anomalies of the physical process. We present a DT framework and provide details on structuring the architecture to support cyber-attack detection. Additionally, we present an experimental case study on off-the-shelf 3D printers to detect cyber-attacks utilizing the proposed DT framework to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Note to Practitioners—This work is motivated by developing a general-purpose and extensible digital twin-enabled cyber-attack detection framework for manufacturing systems. Existing works in the field consider specialized attack scenarios and models that may not be extensible in practical manufacturing scenarios. We utilize digital twin (DT) technology as a key enabler to develop a systematic and extensible framework where we identify the abnormality of a resource and detect if the abnormality is due to an attack or an expected anomaly. We provide several remarks on how our proposed framework can extend existing industrial control systems (ICS) and can accommodate further extensions. The presented DTs utilize data-driven machine learning models, physics-based models, and subject matter expert knowledge to perform detection and differentiation tasks in the context of expected anomalies and model-based controllers that control the manufacturing process between multiple setpoints. We utilize a model predictive controller on an off-the-shelf 3D printer to run the process, and stage anomalies and cyber-attacks that are successfully detected by the proposed framework.},

  abstract={We propose a distributed optical fiber sensing event recognition scheme based on Markov Transition Field (MTF) and knowledge distillation. The event recognition algorithm has the advantages of being lightweight, fast, and high accuracy. The event data are converted into images by the MTF algorithm, which keeps the event signals correlated in the time domain while highlighting the visual differences between different events. A two-stage knowledge distillation model compression method is proposed, which effectively compresses the large-scale model into a lightweight model with optimal learning capability, ensuring the lightweight and efficient recognition of events by the compressed model (student model). The experimental results show that the student model improves the recognition rate of six events by 5.2% and achieves 96.6% event recognition accuracy by the two-stage knowledge distillation method. The size of the student model is only 1.4 MB, the number of parameters is only 0.35 M, and the FLOPs are only 0.17 G. The student model recognizes a single event in 0.129s on a low configuration device, which can meet the requirements of deployment and real-time monitoring of resource-limited devices.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={20399-20417},
  abstract={Data mining approaches have proven to be successful in improving learners’ interaction with educational computer games. Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners’ performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners’ final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners’ actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners’ performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners’ action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial in the deep learning model.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach in semi-supervised learning framework to distill large complex teacher model into a fairly lightweight student model which has the ability of acquiring knowledge from different layers of teacher with the usage of  $K$ -way projecting networks. Across four English datasets in text classification benchmarks and one dataset collected from an Chinese online course, our experiment shows that this student model achieves comparable results with the state of the art Transformer-based semi-supervised text classification methods, while using only 0.156MB parameters and having an inference speed 785 times faster than the teacher model.},

The developed method relies solely on existing information in the electric drive enabling its wide applicability. Adding more sensors to a product is a complicated task, thus it is not a desirable solution. For training and validating the thermal digital twin, a test bench has been designed specifically. Several approaches, from traditional linear models to deep neural networks, have been implemented to emanate the best ML model for estimating the case temperature of the module. Numerous evaluation metrics were then used to assess the investigated methods’ performance and implementation in industrial embedded systems. The proposed solution performed satisfactorily while the powertrain underwent various static and dynamic operating profiles. The model identified a blockage in the air outlet of the drive by monitoring the deviation of the measured and estimated temperatures, thus it prevented the power module from experiencing a fatal failure.},

  abstract={In this paper, to deal with the heterogeneity in federated learning (FL) systems, a knowledge distillation (KD) driven training framework for FL is proposed, where each user can select its neural network model on demand and distill knowledge from a big teacher model using its own private dataset. To overcome the challenge of train the big teacher model in resource limited user devices, the digital twin (DT) is exploit in the way that the teacher model can be trained at DT located in the server with enough computing resources. Then, during model distillation, each user can update the parameters of its model at either the physical entity or the digital agent. The joint problem of model selection and training offloading and resource allocation for users is formulated as a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem. To solve the problem, Q-learning and optimization are jointly used, where Q-learning selects models for users and determines whether to train locally or on the server, and optimization is used to allocate resources for users based on the output of Q-learning. Simulation results show the proposed DT-assisted KD framework and joint optimization method can significantly improve the average accuracy of users while reducing the total delay.},

Although a twin-based implementation of vehicular networks can offer performance optimization, modeling a digital twin is a significantly challenging task. Federated learning (FL) is a better privacy-preserving, distributed learning scheme that can be used to model twin models. Although FL can offer performance enhancement, it requires careful design. Therefore, in this article, we present an overview of FL for a twinbased vehicular network. A general architecture for FL-enabled digital twins for a vehicular network is presented. Our proposed architecture consists of two spaces, such as twin space and the physical space. A physical space consists of all the physical entities (e.g., cars and edge servers) required for vehicular networks, whereas, the twin space refers to the logical space that is used for the deployment of twins. A twin space can be implemented either using edge servers and cloud servers. We also outline a few use cases of FL for the twin-based vehicular network. Finally, the paper is concluded and an outlook on open challenges is presented.},

  abstract={Deep learning has revolutionized the field of robotics. To deal with the lack of annotated training samples for learning deep models in robotics, Sim-to-Real transfer has been invented and widely used. However, such deep models trained in simulation environment typically do not transfer very well to the real world due to the challenging problem of “reality gap”. In response, this letter presents a conceptually new Digital Twin (DT)-CycleGAN framework by integrating the advantages of both DT methodology and the CycleGAN model so that the reality gap can be effectively bridged. Our core innovation is that real and virtual DT robots are forced to mimic each other in a way that the gaps or differences between simulated and realistic robotic behaviors are minimized. To effectively realize this innovation, visual grasping is employed as an exemplar robotic task, and the reality gap in zero-shot Sim-to-Real transfer of visual grasping models is defined as grasping action consistency losses and intrinsically penalized during the DT-CycleGAN training process in realistic simulation environments. Specifically, first, cycle consistency losses between real visual images and simulation images are defined and minimized to reduce the reality gaps in visual appearances during visual grasping tasks. Second, the grasping agent's action consistency losses are defined and penalized to minimize the inconsistency of the grasping agent's actions between the virtual states generated by the DT-CycleGAN generator and the real visual states. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our novel DT-CycleGAN framework for zero-shot Sim-to-Real transfer.},

  title={Using Multimodal Contrastive Knowledge Distillation for Video-Text Retrieval}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={33},
  number={10},
  pages={5486-5497},
  abstract={Cross-modal retrieval aims to enable a flexible bi-directional retrieval experience across different modalities (e.g., searching for videos with texts). Many existing efforts tend to learn a common semantic representation embedding space in which items of different modalities can be directly compared, wherein the positive global representations of video-text pairs are pulled close while the negative ones are pushed apart via pair-wise ranking loss. However, such a vanilla loss would unfortunately yield ambiguous feature embeddings for texts of different videos, causing inaccurate cross-modal matching and unreliable retrievals. Toward this end, we propose a multimodal contrastive knowledge distillation method for instance video-text retrieval, called MCKD, by adaptively using the general knowledge of self-supervised model (teacher) to calibrate mixed boundaries. Specifically, the teacher model is tailored for robust (less-ambiguous) visual-text joint semantic space by maximizing mutual information of co-occurred modalities during multimodal contrastive learning. This robust and structural inter-instance knowledge is then distilled, with the help of explicit discrimination loss, to a student model for improved matching performance. Extensive experiments on four public benchmark video-text datasets (MSR-VTT, TGIF, VATEX, and Youtube2Text) demonstrate that our MCKD can achieve at most 8.8%, 6.4%, 5.9%, and 5.3% improvement in text-to-video performance by the  $\text{R}\text{@}1$  metric, compared with 14 SoTA baselines.},

  abstract={A fundamental issue of the vehicular digital twin (DT) is efficiently synchronizing the data between the DT and the vehicular user (VUE). In this paper, we consider the heterogeneous vehicular networks (HetVNets) in which a VUE can connect to the network through different networks. The HetVNets can improve the efficiency of communication by providing seamless connections. However, the uneven distribution of VUEs and the dynamics of HetVNets make the environment more complex. Therefore, we propose the network selection algorithm for data synchronization between VUEs and DTs in the HetVNets, where the behaviour between the VUEs is considered as a competition for wireless resources. A learning-based prediction model residing in the DT is developed where the DT can predict the waiting time of each relay and transmit the predicted results to the VUE for decision-making. We model the network selection problem as a potential game considering both the transmission time and the waiting time obtained from the prediction model and prove the existence of Nash equilibrium (NE). We analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm, and simulation results show that our approach can effectively find the optimal strategy while achieving a fast convergence speed and high-level performance compared to the baselines.},

  abstract={Nowadays, mobile application services face the challenges of high speed, low latency and high reliability. The combination of digital twin (DT) technology and mobile edge computing (MEC) network can effectively solve these challenges. DT technology can help MEC network monitor and predict the network states. In this paper, we propose a DT-aided MEC network scenario with deep neural network (DNN) inference as the computing task of end devices (EDs). ED can offload part of DNN layers to MEC server. To allocate communication resources, we propose an algorithm based on asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C), which manages the transmission power and channel selection of EDs. Since DNN inference is continuous in real scenes, we consider the continuous DNN inference tasks. We convert the DNN optimal partition point solving problem to a min st-cut problem, and propose a graph theory based DNN optimal partition point solving algorithm to minimize the inference latency. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the inference latency. Compared with actor-critic (AC) and deep Q network (DQN), the proposed algorithm has faster convergence speed and better convergence value. Compared with the traditional one-time DNN model partition algorithm, the proposed algorithm is more suitable for DNN continuous task arrival scenario.},

The UAV s perform the data collection for a virtual service provider (VSP) for the synchronization between the physical objects and digital twins (DTs). The UAVs buy energy resources from an energy service provider (ESP). The key issue is to motivate both the ESP and the UAV s to participate in the energy trading market. For this, we design a deep learning (DL)-based auction scheme that maximizes the revenue of the ESP while guaranteeing individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC).

  year={2023},

  abstract={The aircrafts were top of the places that disrupted the seamless connectivity requirement of 5G and beyond. The Aeronautical Ad-hoc Networks (AANETs) take the attention of both industry and academia to satisfy this connectivity requirement with the low cost, easy deployment, and continuous coverage features. On the other hand, the ultra-dynamic characteristics of AANET with unstructured topology make its environment hard-to-follow. Here, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methodologies have an essential role in handling the management complexity of this hard-to-follow environment. However, these methodologies increase the computational complexity of aircraft due to the continuous update, convergence time, and scalability issues. At that point, we propose the utilization of the Digital Twin (DT) technology to handle the management complexity of AANET while solving the main issues of AI-based methodologies on it. The DT can virtually replicate the physical AANET components through closed-loop feedback in real-time. Therefore, this work introduces the utilization of DT technology for the AANET orchestration and, accordingly, proposes a DT-enabled AANET (DT-AANET) topology management framework. This framework consists of the Physical AANET Twin and Controller, including Digital AANET Twin with Operational Module. Here, the Digital AANET Twin virtually represents the physical environment while the operational module executes the AI-based computations on them through unsupervised learning-based training or supervised learning-based prediction. Finally, we present a case study based on Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) to show the usability of the proposed framework and support this through evaluation results.},

  pages={3256-3269},
  abstract={A core issue of safe human-machine cooperative driving lies in dynamic assessment of the rapidly evolving driving risks. Given that, this paper proposes a shared controller for safe and human-friendly cooperative driving based on predictive risk assessment enabled by Digital Twin technologies. In the digital world, we create a fine-grained digital replica of the driving scene comprising historical motions of vehicles, as well as roadway geometries and topologies. On the basis of that, spatial-temporal interactive features are obtained with a deep learning-based model and subsequently decoded to predict future trajectories of each target vehicle in the neighborhood of the ego-vehicle. In the physical world, the predicted trajectories of neighboring vehicles are integrated into the risk distribution to construct predictive risk fields. A novel shared controller in the framework of multi-objective MPC is designed to minimize the driving risk while matching driver's commands, so that safe cooperative driving is achieved in a smooth and minimal-intervention manner. The results of driver-in-the-loop simulation experiments demonstrate the enabling role of the Digital Twin in improving the assessment of risk in highly dynamic scenes through taking the motion trends of dynamic agents into account. The results also show the superiority of the Digital Twin-based shared controller in terms of implementing cooperation in time while honoring the driver's commands whenever possible.},

  pages={2650-2660},
  abstract={Deep learning has been widely used in intelligent vehicle driving perception systems, such as 3D object detection. One promising technique is Cooperative Perception, which leverages Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication to share deep learning-based features among vehicles. However, most cooperative perception algorithms assume ideal communication and do not consider the impact of Lossy Communication (LC), which is very common in the real world, on feature sharing. In this paper, we explore the effects of LC on Cooperative Perception and propose a novel approach to mitigate these effects. Our approach includes an LC-aware Repair Network (LCRN) and a V2V Attention Module (V2VAM) with intra-vehicle attention and uncertainty-aware inter-vehicle attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the public OPV2V dataset (a digital-twin simulated dataset) using point cloud-based 3D object detection. Our results show that our approach improves detection performance under lossy V2V communication. Specifically, our proposed method achieves a significant improvement in Average Precision compared to the state-of-the-art cooperative perception algorithms, which proves the capability of our approach to effectively mitigate the negative impact of LC and enhance the interaction between the ego vehicle and other vehicles.},

  abstract={Cell-free networking enables full cooperation among distributed access points (APs). This paper focuses on reducing the long-term energy consumption of a cell-free network in the downlink integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) for achieving energy sustainability. The resultant design includes both the AP classification on a large time-scale and the beamforming of the APs on a small time-scale in order to simultaneously satisfy the IDET requirements of data users and energy users. For dealing with binary integer actions (AP classification) and continuous actions (beamforming) together, we innovatively propose a stable double parameterized deep-Q-network (DP-DQN), which can be enhanced by a digital twin (DT) running in the intelligent core processor (ICP) so as to achieve faster and more stable convergence. Therefore, the cell-free network may avoid suffering from performance fluctuation during the training process. The simulation results demonstrate that our DP-DQN exceeds in convergence compared to other benchmarks while guaranteeing an optimal solution.},

  abstract={This work introduces a novel architecture of federated learning (FL)-enabled digital twin (DT) for the smart additive manufacturing industry, especially 3D printing. The proposed architecture tackles the previous limitation of the centralized approach that requires a large number of communication costs by efficiently updating the fault detection model on each server with distributed learning methods. A CNN-based model is also proposed to efficiently learn sensory data from a 3D printer for a fast and reliable fault detection model. To provide a robust system in intelligent manufacturing, a DT platform is also designed for seamless monitoring and control purposes. The proposed DT platform is able to initiate, monitor, and terminate the 3D printing process of physical assets via a virtual environment. Based on the simulation results, the FL process demonstrates that the proposed CNN-based model is superior to other DL models with 8% accuracy enlargement while maintaining the low training period. Furthermore, experimental work is conducted to evaluate the proposed architecture with real-world devices. Finally, the findings indicate that the overall latency given by the proposed system is relatively low, with an average of 1026.16 ms from the physical 3D printer to the DT platform.},

  abstract={Machine teaching is an inverse problem of machine learning that aims at steering the student toward its target hypothesis, in which the teacher has already known the student’s learning parameters. Previous studies on machine teaching focused on balancing the teaching risk and cost to find the best teaching examples deriving from the student model. This optimization solver is in general ineffective when the student does not disclose any cue of the learning parameters. To supervise such a teaching scenario, this article presents a distribution matching-based machine teaching strategy via iteratively shrinking the teaching cost in a smooth surrogate, which eliminates boundary perturbations from the version space. Technically, our strategy could be redefined as a cost-controlled optimization process that finds the optimal teaching examples without further exploring the parameter distribution of the student. Then, given any limited teaching cost, the training examples would have a closed-form expression. Theoretical analysis and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy.},

The digital twin of the robot is programmed and debugged through a custom ROS interface to enable motion planning of the real robot, thus enabling virtual-real interaction. It collects and analyzes the robot's working status in real-time while the robot is operating and maps the robot twin to the real robot in real time to achieve remote 3D real-time monitoring of the robot.

  pages={4715-4728},
  abstract={In Industry 5.0 vision, machines are empowered with the interaction capability to autonomously make local decisions and coordinate with each other as well as humans. However, how to form a group consensus on the rapid self-organizing of the manufacturing process is critical for achieving manufacturing resilience under disturbances and disruptions. Based on our formerly developed system ManuChain (Leng et al., 2020), this article proposes a blockchained smart contract system (BSCS), named ManuChain II, as the digital twin of a decentralized autonomous manufacturing system for achieving resilience in Industry 5.0. A blockchain-secured multiagent system architecture together with a product data model is established to form the BSCS. The BSCS could prevent tampering with data and enhance the transparency of the product manufacturing process. In BSCS, two types of blockchained smart contracts (SCs) are established with a bi-level interplay computing architecture. The lower-level contracts perform the predefined and learned patterns of task coordination for achieving resilience under internal disruptions. The upper-level contracts are incorporated with communication-efficient decentralized deep-learning algorithms for the learning, updating, transferring, and sharing of coordination patterns used in the autonomous decision in lower-level SCs, thereby achieving the continuous improvement of the system’s decentralized autonomous intelligence. Via incorporating the decentralized deep learning algorithms into blockchained SCs, this study reveals a new way to realize the self-organizing intelligence of the manufacturing system for enhancing resilience toward Industry 5.0.},

  abstract={A digital twin is a widely used method that uses digitized simulations of the real-world characteristics because it is effective in predicting results at a low cost. In digital twin analysis, the transfer function between the input and output data is an important research subject. In this study, we intend to investigate the application of the digital twin method to dust particle sensing. A high-performance multi-channel reference dust particle sensor provides particle count as well as particulate matter information, whereas a lightweight embedded test device only provides a particle count. The particulate matter acquisition algorithm for a reference device is unknown and complex. Instead of that, we propose a simple method to calculate the transfer function using singular-value decomposition. In the experimental results, using singular-value decomposition, the predicted particulate matter of the test device was similar to that of the reference device. The obtained transfer function shows similar measurement results of the two dust particle sensor devices, confirming that particulate matter environmental information can be digitized even with low-power and lightweight sensor-embedded devices. In addition, the power consumption of the test device was approximately ten times lower than that of the reference device.},

  year={2023},
  volume={10},

  pages={15362-15375},
  abstract={Most existing multiunmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) systems focus on fly path or energy consumption for task assignment, while little attention has been paid to the dynamic feature of the task, resulting in poor task completion ratio. The machine learning (ML) paradigm provides new methodologies for task assignment. However, ML methods are usually of heavy resource-consumption that cannot be directly applied in the UAV. In this article, a digital-twin (DT)-assisted task assignment approach is proposed to improve the resource-intensive utilization and the efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in multi-UAV system. The approach has a three-layer network structure which can dynamically assign tasks based on the task time constraints. Moreover, the approach is divided into two stages of initial task-assignment and task-reassignment. In the first stage, airship divides a task into multiple subtasks according to the shortest distance based on genetic algorithm and assigns them to UAVs. In the second stage, the DT can be leveraged to enable the airships to learn from the features of tasks and to generate the  $Q$ -value of the estimated value network of DRL for UAVs via pretrain of DT. The  $Q$ -value can be directly applied for deep  $Q$ -learning network (DQN) in the UAVs to reduce the training episode. Furthermore, the DQN is adopted to train task-reassignment strategy. Simulation results indicate that the DQN with DT can significantly reduce the training episode, improving 30% of the task completion ratio and 19% of the system energy efficiency compared with that of the baseline methods.},

  abstract={Abnormal gait is a significant noncognitive biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD). Micro-Doppler radar (MDR), a nonwearable technology, can capture human gait movements for potential early ADRD risk assessment. In this article, we propose to design a systematic radar intelligence analysis for ARDR risk evaluation (STRIDE) integrating MDR sensors with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. STRIDE embeds a new deep learning (DL) classification framework. As a proof of concept, we develop a “digital twin” of STRIDE, consisting of a human walking simulation model and an MDR simulation model, to generate a gait signature dataset. Taking established human walking parameters, the walking model simulates individuals with ADRD under various conditions. The radar model based on electromagnetic scattering and the Doppler frequency shift model is employed to generate micro-Doppler signatures from different moving body parts (e.g., foot, limb, joint, torso, and shoulder). A band-dependent DL framework is developed to predict ADRD risks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of STRIDE for evaluating ADRD risk.},

  year={2023},
  volume={20},

  pages={55-68},
  abstract={The connected autonomous vehicle is considered an effective way to improve transport safety and efficiency. To overcome the limited sensing and computing capabilities of individual vehicles, we design a digital twin assisted decision-making framework for Internet of Vehicles, by leveraging the integration of communication, sensing and computing. In this framework, the digital twin entities residing on edge can effectively communicate and cooperate with each other to plan sub-targets for their respective vehicles, while the vehicles only need to achieve the sub-targets by generating a sequence of atomic actions. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical multiagent reinforcement learning approach to implement the framework, which can be trained in an end-to-end way. In the proposed approach, the communication interval of digital twin entities could adapt to time-varying environment. Extensive experiments on driving decision-making have been performed in traffic junction scenarios of different difficulties. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can largely improve collaboration efficiency while reducing communication overhead.},

  abstract={SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONSThis paper presents a Design for Availability approach for repairable health care Systems and Solutions; based on a framework which merges modeling approaches with managing and balancing of Reliability and Maintainability characteristics. The approach is used to prioritize the required Design for Reliability and Maintainability activities during the development phases of health care Systems and Solutions. It is supported by an ‘easy’ and ‘intuitive’ web-based toolset.The presented approach is applicable to product development and continuous improvement of fielded systems. It also serves as an enabler of digital twins for further Availability optimization.The Design for Availability approach starts with modeling of the System and Solution design in the Availability Design Tool, considering existing and new functionalities as well as different maintenance types. This is done in a hierarchal way to manage complexity. Historical data analysis as well as change point analysis are used to predict the Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Life Cycle Cost of the Systems and Solutions under development.Field data on both Reliability as well as Maintainability aspects are obtained via a data pipeline, thereby connecting the web-based Availability Design Tool with the data lake. For non-part related Maintenance activities, work order text analytics with Deep Learning algorithms is used to classify the activities and their impact. This is fed to the Availability model to improve the overall predictive capability of the model.With the Availability model and FMEA as inputs, a qualitative and quantitative analysis is executed to determine the Maintainability and Reliability of critical elements and parts in the proposed design. Easy execution of the FMEA is supported by a web based FMEA tool, allowing clear technical risk identification and prioritization.Based on the criticality analysis, work packages are defined. The work packages contain the Design for Reliability and Maintainability activities required, to ensure that the Systems and Solutions Availability and Life Cycle Cost objectives are met.Upon execution of the Design for Reliability and Maintainability activities, the initial model will require updates because of improved knowledge and understanding of probabilities of failure modes. This is also necessary due to the implemented design changes which mitigate the identified Reliability and Maintainability criticalities; either by preventing failures from occurring, implementation of fault tolerance or fault removal strategies.The approach allows for creating a hierarchical Availability model which includes Hardware as well as Software elements and feeding it with (near real-time) field data. This allows and prepares the model for use as digital twin for further optimization of the Availability of health care Systems and Solutions. The approach can be applied on an individual system as well as on multiple systems; enabled by an easy and free-to-use web-based toolset.},

  abstract={Deep learning has advanced dramatically in recent years, and especially large convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding performance in a wide variety of tasks. However, such large-scale CNNs may not be able to be utilized in practice because they require a lot of computational resources. Therefore, there is a need to realize a CNN in a small model that has high performance similar to the large CNN. One method to solve these problems is Distillation, which uses a model of large scale and high performance as the teacher and a small model as the student model, and performs model compression by transferring the knowledge of the teacher model to the student model. However, in distillation, even when the teacher model incorrectly guesses the training input, the student model learns to mimic the teacher. This can prevent the student model from learning better. In this paper, we propose Meritbased Distillation, in which the accuracy of the teacher model’s output determines the degree to which the student model mimics the teacher model’s output, thereby preventing the student to learn undesired mappings. In the experiment, the effect of the Merit-based Distillation is evaluated. Consequently, the proposed method outperforms the improvements in the generalization by the student models trained by other known methods.},

  pages={35035-35058},
  abstract={A digital twin is a powerful tool that can help monitor and optimize physical assets in real-time. Simply put, it is a virtual representation of a physical asset, enabled through data and simulators, that can be used for a variety of purposes such as prediction, monitoring, and decision-making. However, the concept of digital twin can be vague and difficult to understand, which is why a new concept called “capability level” has been introduced. This concept categorizes digital twins based on their capability and defines a scale from zero to five, with each level indicating an increasing level of functionality. These levels are standalone, descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive, and autonomous. By understanding the capability level of a digital twin, we can better understand its potential and limitations. To demonstrate the concepts, we use a modern house as an example. The house is equipped with a range of sensors that collect data about its internal state, which can then be used to create digital twins of different capability levels. These digital twins can be visualized in virtual reality, allowing users to interact with and manipulate the virtual environment. The current work not only presents a blueprint for developing digital twins but also suggests future research directions to enhance this technology. Digital twins have the potential to transform the way we monitor and optimize physical assets, and by understanding their capabilities, we can unlock their full potential.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of deep learning technology, the size and performance of the network continuously grow, making network compression essential for commercial applications. In this paper, we propose a Feature Self Attention (FSA) module that extracts correlation information between the hidden features of a network and a new method for distilling the correlation features to compress the model. FSA does not require a special module or network to match features between the teacher model and the student model. By removing the multi-head structure and the repeated self-attention blocks in the existing self-attention mechanism, it minimizes the addition of parameters. Based on ResNet-18, 34, the added parameters are only 2.00M and the training speed is also the fastest in comparison to benchmark models. It was demonstrated through experiments that the use of interrelationship loss between features can be beneficial for training student models, indicating the importance of considering correlation information in deep neural network compression. And it was verified through training from scratch on the vanilla without the pre-trained weight of the student model.},

  abstract={Owing to the breakthrough in mobile wireless communication technologies, almost everyone has been immersed into social networks, while fake news and misinformation are also being pushed into people’s minds with astonishing speed and breadth. The rising disparity between limited computing resources and the exploding news size necessitates innovative solutions to handle the challenge posed by booming data volume and make it more likely to differentiate fake news. In response to the aforementioned dilemma, the social-aware computation offloading system is analyzed, where the digital twin (DT) paradigm is used to simulate tasks offloading and assess the associated costs. Next, to obtain the best offloading choice, we fully consider the social relationship constraints and further propose an online task execution method that includes two stages of cluster selection and computing offloading, named TOFDS. Specifically, it exploits the technologies from multiobjective optimization and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and realizes the joint optimization of resource utilization, load balancing, service latency, and energy consumption. Eventually, the comparative experiments demonstrate that TOFDS performs well when dealing with fake news data and can adapt to changes in dataset size and service clusters.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-15},
  abstract={Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) aims to identify the snippets involving anomalous events in long untrimmed videos, with solely video-level binary labels. A typical paradigm among the existing WS-VAD methods is to employ multiple modalities as inputs, e.g., RGB, optical flow, and audio, as they can provide sufficient discriminative clues that are robust to the diverse, complicated real-world scenes. However, such a pipeline has high reliance on the availability of multiple modalities and is computationally expensive and storage demanding in processing long sequences, which limits its use in some applications. To address this dilemma, we propose a privileged knowledge distillation (KD) framework dedicated to the WS-VAD task, which can maintain the benefits of exploiting additional modalities, while avoiding the need for using multimodal data in the inference phase. We argue that the performance of the privileged KD framework mainly depends on two factors: 1) the effectiveness of the multimodal teacher network and 2) the completeness of the useful information transfer. To obtain a reliable teacher network, we propose a cross-modal interactive learning strategy and an anomaly normal discrimination loss, which target learning task-specific cross-modal features and encourage the separability of anomalous and normal representations, respectively. Furthermore, we design both representation-and logits-level distillation loss functions, which force the unimodal student network to distill abundant privileged knowledge from the well-trained multimodal teacher network, in a snippet-to-video fashion. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed privileged KD framework can train a lightweight yet effective detector, for localizing anomaly events under the supervision of video-level annotations.},

  year={2023},
  volume={10},
  number={18},
  pages={15931-15942},
  abstract={The data collected by sensors is streaming data in the Internet of Things (IoT). Although existing deep-learning-based anomaly detection methods generally perform well on static data, they struggle to respond timely to streaming data after distribution changes. However, streaming data suffers from conceptual drift due to the highly dynamic nature of IoT. In network security, concept drift-oriented anomaly detection is a crucial task, because it can adjust the model to adapt to the latest data, and detect attacks in time. Existing streaming anomaly detection methods are confronted with some challenges, including the latency of model updates, the uneven importance of new data, and the self-poisoning due to model self-updates. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a knowledge distillation-based adaptive anomaly detection model toward concept drift, ADTCD. ADTCD transfers the knowledge of the teacher model to the student model and only updates the student model to reduce the delay. We construct an algorithm of dynamically adjusting model parameters, which dynamically adjusts model weights through local inference on new samples, in order to improve the model’s responsiveness to new distribution data, meanwhile solving the problem of uneven importance of new data. In addition, we adopt a one-class support vector-based outlier removal method to tackle the self-poisoning problem. In comprehensive experiments on seven high-dimensional data sets, ADTCD achieves an AUC improvement of 12.46% compared to the state-of-the-art streaming anomaly detection methods. Our future direction will focus on exploring the concept-drift problem using methods beyond autoencoders.},

  year={2023},
  volume={72},
  number={},
  pages={1-13},
  abstract={Billet heating temperature directly affects the quality of the billet, but the existing technology cannot measure the billet surface temperature. Therefore, we accurately predict the temperature of the furnace by a soft sensor to approximate the billet temperature. Limited by the complexity of the heating process and the lack of computing resources in factories, the existing research pays little attention to or even cannot meet the temperature prediction requirements of multiple heating zones in multiple heating furnaces. To address the above problems, we propose a temperature prediction method for multiheating furnaces based on transfer learning and knowledge distillation. The method establishes a multisource domain model of a source domain furnace on a cloud platform. Then, the multisource knowledge is transferred to the target domain heating furnace, and the target domain teacher model is established by fine-tuning the source domain model through the target domain data. Next, to efficiently predict the furnace temperature, a shallow multitask student model is established at the edge server to predict multiple heating zones in the target furnace. Furthermore, a knowledge distillation method for regression prediction is proposed so that the student model can improve the prediction accuracy under the guidance of the cloud teacher model. The effectiveness of the method is verified by experiments on 20 different heating zone datasets in two heating furnaces and two wind turbine datasets. The consistency of multiple experiments shows that this method cannot only improve the accuracy by transferring the source domain knowledge but also reduce the size of model parameters by knowledge distillation on the premise of meeting the requirements of prediction error.},

  number={4},
  pages={4448-4460},
  abstract={Intelligent Virtual Machine (VM) provisioning is central to cost and resource efficient computation in cloud computing environments. As bootstrapping VMs is time-consuming, a key challenge for latency-critical tasks is to predict future workload demands to provision VMs proactively. However, existing AI-based solutions tend to not holistically consider all crucial aspects such as provisioning overheads, heterogeneous VM costs and Quality of Service (QoS) of the cloud system. To address this, we propose a novel method, called CILP, that formulates the VM provisioning problem as two sub-problems of prediction and optimization, where the provisioning plan is optimized based on predicted workload demands. CILP leverages a neural network as a surrogate model to predict future workload demands with a co-simulated digital-twin of the infrastructure to compute QoS scores. We extend the neural network to also act as an imitation learner that dynamically decides the optimal VM provisioning plan. A transformer based neural model reduces training and inference overheads while our novel two-phase decision making loop facilitates in making informed provisioning decisions. Crucially, we address limitations of prior work by including resource utilization, deployment costs and provisioning overheads to inform the provisioning decisions in our imitation learning framework. Experiments with three public benchmarks demonstrate that CILP gives up to 22% higher resource utilization, 14% higher QoS scores and 44% lower execution costs compared to the current online and offline optimization based state-of-the-art methods.},

This paper discusses the application of interactive design based on BP neural network in Museum navigation. In this project, we use BP neural network to predict the user's next destination from the user's current location, and then display it on the map. BP neural network is used to predict the next destination according to the user's current location, and then display it on the map. BP neural network can be used as an intelligent system to identify objects or people by viewing images or videos. It is one of the most popular technologies because it has many advantages over other machine learning technologies (such as supervised and unsupervised learning methods), which cannot process video data. In this paper, the user behavior of visitors is collected by means of on-site research, structured interview, case tracking, online research, etc., and the user model of museum visitors is obtained through analysis and research, which provides the basis of user experience for practical design. By analyzing the cognitive characteristics of indoor geographic space, the principles of indoor map design are summarized, and the guiding principles for indoor navigation products of museums are obtained by considering the special scenes of museums, the needs of visitors and other factors.},

  abstract={Healthcare has always been a very profitable and resource-intensive industry, and it is also one of the only ones that have never reached a digital transformation peak. A network of 3D virtual worlds centered on social interaction is known as a metaverse. As the world becomes more dependent on technology, more consideration must be given to both individual privacy and the solutions offered by cybersecurity companies. In the metaverse, patient data security is a challenge. High-tech wearables including glasses, gloves, sensors, and other wearables that can detect patients' vital signs are needed in order to fully utilize the metaverse in healthcare. Technology is constrained since the hardware is still pricey and cannot be accessed by many members of society. The health Metaverse framework primarily focuses on telemedicine and online health management, multimodal medical information standards, the fusion of medical and social data, and medical artificial intelligence. Additionally, it offers crucial inventive dynamism in surgical procedures, medical education, and the interactions between service providers and clients. Technology improvements, gamification of healthcare, patient privacy protection, and barriers stopping individuals from giving up reality are all obstacles. This technological advancement had a lot to offer the ailing medical infrastructure industry, including telemedicine services, virtual examinations employing VR, AR, and blockchain to assure secure data and financial transmissions, as well as a variety of other as-yet untapped possibilities. Data security, data interoperability, and laws are just a few of the difficulties that the healthcare sector in the metaverse will face. To address these issues, new infrastructure, standards, and procedures will be required. This study looks at a number of issues that affect the healthcare industry and how to address them when the metaverse enters the mainstream of healthcare.},

  abstract={For athletes, coaches, or rehabilitation patients, the systems currently used to perform biomechanical studies and the dependence on technical experts for interpreting analyses and results can limit organizational, logistical, and economic resources. In this project, a Recurrent Neural Network model was created to predict human joint accelerations through the automatic digitalization of human body movement using video and acceleration sensors. The project aimed to prevent injuries and fractures in athletes and the elderly population because there is a lack of tools that predicts the risk of these traumas as a preventive method. Acceleration data was collected using Matlab mobile installed in cell phones attached to the arms and legs of volunteers doing physical tasks (walking, running, jumping). Experiments were video recorded, and machine learning models were trained using acceleration and video using Python libraries. After model evaluation, we observed that the selected model could predict the best on the XY axes and the worst on the Z axis, probably due to predicting a three-dimensional feature with a two-dimensional input. A biomechanical Digital Twin was created by combining the information from wearable devices, computer vision, and machine learning algorithms. This tool was able to estimate human joint accelerations (up to an extent) during movements with more refinement; it can help to evaluate movement performance within exercises or tasks and aid in injury/fracture risk prediction.},

  abstract={Applying semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods, such as pseudo labeling and consistency regularization, to rotating machinery fault diagnosis alleviates the difficulty of obtaining a large amount of labeled data in industrial practice. The low accuracy of teacher models initially trained with limited labeled samples, however, often affects the performance of pseudo-labeling methods. Besides, when the existing consistency regularization methods are applied to vibration signals, there is also the problem that the label information may be damaged due to the difficulty in interpreting the 1-D data augmentation (DA) tool. To address these obstacles, a novel two-stage hybrid SSL method based on grouped pseudo labeling and consistency regularization is developed to generalize mechanical fault diagnosis ability under limited labeled samples. In the first stage, inspired by the label coherence among samples at similar acquisition times, the proposed method fed signal samples with similar acquisition times into the teacher network in groups. Then, the obtained predicted labels are averaged, and a threshold evaluates the validity of the obtained averaged pseudo labels. In the second stage, mixed labeled and remaining grouped unlabeled samples are fed into the student model for supervised and consistency regularization training. In addition, compared with traditional consistency regularization algorithms using mean square error (MSE) metric to estimate label information consistency between the original and related augmented samples, the trace of the covariance matrix is introduced to realize estimating the label information consistency among multiple unlabeled samples in a group. Experiments verify that the proposed hybrid SSL method steadily improves the fault diagnosis accuracy of two gearboxes with fewer labeled samples to nearly 100%.},

  abstract={The efficient target detection approach of UAVs is an attractive way to improve the detection precision without hardware redesign. This paper investigates a semi-supervised target detection approach for UAVs using improved unbiased teacher (IUT). Considering the scarcity of balanced labeled data, a lot of unlabeled data is utilized based on the semi-supervised learning framework. To enhance the target detection accuracy with unlabeled data, an improved unbiased teacher model is proposed, where multi-channel enhanced data is used for teacher model training, and good pseudo-labeling labeled data via fusion non-maximum suppression module is obtained and employed for student model learning. Comparative experiments with supervised-based design, self-training and augmentation driven consistency regularization, and standard unbiased teacher illustrate the effectiveness and higher detection accuracy of the proposed IUT approach.},

  abstract={Arrhythmia classification is crucial for identifying and preventing the potential risks associated with cardiovascular diseases. Currently., using deep learning for arrhythmia classification faces challenges of model complexity and deployment difficulty. To address this., We present a novel approach for classifying arrhythmias using knowledge distillation and 2D ECG images. In this study., the classification of the MIT-BIH dataset is performed according to AAMI criteria. Preprocessing., such as denoising., interception., and 2D grayscale image conversion., is first performed. Then., high-performance 2D-CNN models are pre-trained using 2D ECG images as the teacher model., and a lightweight 1D-CNN is constructed as the student model. Finally., we align raw and 2D ECG data., utilizing knowledge distillation to allow the student model to learn from the teacher model during the training process., thus enabling model compression. The final results show that the method significantly improves the performance of the student model in arrhythmia classification. For overall performance., when using Vgg16 as the teacher model., Acc and P+ improve by 1.62% and 6.64%., and Se is comparable. In addition., the F1-score values have been improved in all categories. The proposed method provides a feasible approach for low computational power device deployment for arrhythmia classification.},

  volume={33},

  pages={6832-6844},
  abstract={Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has promising potential for improving model performance using both labelled and unlabelled data. Since recovering 3D information from 2D images is an ill-posed problem, the current state-of-the-art methods of monocular 3D object detection (Mono3D) have relatively low precision and recall, making semi-supervised learning for Mono3D tasks challenging and understudied. In this work, we propose a unified and effective semi-supervised learning framework called Mix-Teaching that can be applied to most monocular 3D object detectors. Based on the idea of decomposition and recombination, unlabelled samples are firstly decomposed into collections of image patches with high-quality predictions and collections of background images containing no objects. The student model is then trained on the mixed images containing dense instances with high-quality pseudo-labels generated by the recombination operation. In addition, we propose an uncertainty-based filter to distinguish high-quality pseudo-labels from noisy predictions during the decomposition process. As results in KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks, Mix-Teaching consistently improves MonoFlex and GUPNet by significant margins under various labeling ratios. Our method achieves around +6.34%  $AP_{3D}$  improvement against the GUPNet on the validation set when using only 10% labelled data. Using the full training set and the additional 38K raw images from KITTI, it can further improve the MonoFlex by +4.65% absolute improvement on  $AP_{3D}$  for car detection, reaching 18.54%  $AP_{3D}$ , which ranks the 1st place among all monocular based methods on the KITTI test leaderboard.},

  abstract={The digital twin workshop is considered a key technology for the transparency and continuous optimization of the workshop production process, as well as the trend of digital and intelligent development of the workshop. However, the current workshop digital twin model lacks a framework that can correlate the entire physical entity of the workshop and continuously compute and learn to empower the workshop with cognitive capabilities that can adapt to changing production conditions or new production scenarios. In this paper, a workshop digital twin model construction method based on group systems cognition (GS C) is proposed, aiming to realize the overall cognition of workshop production process in multiple layers from low-level physical subsystem to high-level group systems. Combining digital twin technology with the general cognitive principles of human problem solving in cognitive science, a workshop digital twin model framework including physical layer, virtual layer and cognitive layer is established; then, a multi-level cognitive computing model with sustainable learning capability was constructed by using information technology, so that the workshop twin model has cognitive capability. Finally, the application validation of the GSC-based workshop twin was carried out in an aerospace structural component manufacturing workshop as an example, and it was verified that GSC can endow the workshop twin with certain cognitive ability and effectively improve the workshop productivity.},

  abstract={Automated multi-label chest X-rays (CXR) image classification has achieved substantial progress in clinical diagnosis via utilizing sophisticated deep learning approaches. However, most deep models have high computational demands, which makes them less feasible for compact devices with low computational requirements. To overcome this problem, we propose a knowledge distillation (KD) strategy to create the compact deep learning model for the real-time multi-label CXR image classification. We study different alternatives of CNNs and Transforms as the teacher to distill the knowledge to a smaller student. Then, we employed explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to provide the visual explanation for the model decision improved by the KD. Our results on three benchmark CXR datasets show that our KD strategy provides the improved performance on the compact student model, thus being the feasible choice for many limited hardware platforms. For instance, when using DenseNet161 as the teacher network, EEEA-Net-C2 achieved an AUC of 83.7%, 87.1%, and 88.7% on the ChestX-ray14, CheXpert, and PadChest datasets, respectively, with fewer parameters of 4.7 million and computational cost of 0.3 billion FLOPS.},

  abstract={Time series data generated by continuous glucose monitoring sensors offer unparalleled opportunities for developing data-driven approaches, especially deep learning-based models, in diabetes management. Although these approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various fields such as glucose prediction in type 1 diabetes (T1D), challenges remain in the acquisition of large-scale individual data for personalized modeling due to the elevated cost of clinical trials and data privacy regulations. In this work, we introduce GluGAN, a framework specifically designed for generating personalized glucose time series based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Employing recurrent neural network (RNN) modules, the proposed framework uses a combination of unsupervised and supervised training to learn temporal dynamics in latent spaces. Aiming to assess the quality of synthetic data, we apply clinical metrics, distance scores, and discriminative and predictive scores computed by post-hoc RNNs in evaluation. Across three clinical datasets with 47 T1D subjects (including one publicly available and two proprietary datasets), GluGAN achieved better performance for all the considered metrics when compared with four baseline GAN models. The performance of data augmentation is evaluated by three machine learning-based glucose predictors. Using the training sets augmented by GluGAN significantly reduced the root mean square error for the predictors over 30 and 60-minute horizons. The results suggest that GluGAN is an effective method in generating high-quality synthetic glucose time series and has the potential to be used for evaluating the effectiveness of automated insulin delivery algorithms and as a digital twin to substitute for pre-clinical trials.},

  abstract={Multirobot system for manufacturing is an Industry Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm with significant operational cost savings and productivity improvement, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed to control and implement collaborative productions without human intervention. This mission-critical system relies on 3-dimension (3-D) scene recognition to improve operation accuracy in the production line and autonomous piloting. However, implementing 3-D point cloud learning, such as Pointnet, is challenging due to limited sensing and computing resources equipped with UAVs. Therefore, we propose a digital twin (DT) empowered knowledge distillation (KD) method to generate several lightweight learning models and select the optimal model to deploy on UAVs. With a digital replica of the UAVs preserved at the edge server, the DT system controls the model-sharing network topology and learning model structure to improve recognition accuracy further. Moreover, we employ network calculus to formulate and solve the model sharing configuration problem toward minimal resource consumption, as well as convergence. Simulation experiments are conducted over a popular point cloud data set to evaluate the proposed scheme. Experiment results show that the proposed model-sharing scheme outperforms the individual model in terms of computing resource consumption and recognition accuracy.},

In addition, they rely on a large amount of labeled data, which is inconsistent with semi-supervised learning requirements. To solve these limitations, we propose a Neighborhood Correction Weight-Adaptive Multi-teacher Knowledge Distillation (NC-WAMKD) framework, which involves the knowledge distillation strategy WAMKD and the student model with Neighborhood Correction Label Propagation and Feature Transformation (NCLF). Specifically, WAMKD is designed to adaptively assign weights for multiple teachers to avoid misleading student by low-quality teachers. NCLF relies on neighborhood correction label propagation and feature transformation to validly predict unlabeled nodes. Experiments on semi-supervised node classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Code is available: https://github.com/para-99/NC-WAMKD.},

Existing efforts guide the distillation by matching their prediction logits, feature embedding, etc., while leaving how to efficiently utilize them in junction less explored. In this paper, we propose Hint-dynamic Knowledge Distillation, dubbed HKD, which excavates the knowledge from the teacher’s hints in a dynamic scheme. The guidance effect from the knowledge hints usually varies in different instances and learning stages, which motivates us to customize a specific hint-learning manner for each instance adaptively. Specifically, a meta-weight network is introduced to generate the instance-wise weight coefficients about knowledge hints in the perception of the dynamical learning progress of the student model. We further present a weight ensembling strategy to eliminate the potential bias of coefficient estimation by exploiting the historical statics. Experiments on standard benchmarks of CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet manifest that the proposed HKD well boost the effect of knowledge distillation tasks.},

  abstract={Task-oriented dialogue systems have become overwhelmingly popular in recent researches. Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is widely used to extract the semantics frame of user queries and comprehend users’ intent/emotion/dialogue state in task-oriented dialogue systems. Most previous works on such discriminative tasks only model current query or historical conversations. Even if the entire conversation flow is modeled in some work, it is not suitable for real-world task-oriented dialogue systems, where future contexts are not visible until a response is given based on the current dialogue state. In this paper, we propose to jointly model historical and future information using knowledge distillation methods to address the discrepancy between offline and online information in dialogue understanding. More specifically, by modeling the current utterance and past contexts as student, and the entire dialogue flow as teacher, we optimize the "distance" between these two networks to regularize our student model in both online and offline ways. Our experiments on two dialogue datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving superior results compared with all baseline models.},

  abstract={Feature-map based knowledge distillation has exhibited its significance in improving the performance of student model. Existing works mainly focus on the formulation of knowledge, but ignore the number difference of channels due to heterogeneous architectures of teacher-student pair. They generally adopt handcrafted matching or input-independent association matrix, which would lead to the semantic mismatch, thus suboptimal performance. To resolve this problem, we present an input-dependent channel association module. This module automatically generates an allocation matrix in a cross-attention manner, which enables each student channel to be dynamically connected to its semantic-related teacher channel based on its learning state. An alternative training scheme is applied for stable optimization. Extensive experiments on image classification with a variety of settings based on the popular network architectures well demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.},

  abstract={Self-supervised speech pre-training enables deep neural network models to capture meaningful and disentangled factors from raw waveform signals. The learned universal speech representations can then be used across numerous down-stream tasks. These representations, however, are sensitive to distribution shifts caused by environmental factors, such as noise and/or room reverberation. Their large sizes, in turn, make them unfeasible for edge applications. In this work, we propose a knowledge distillation methodology termed RobustDistiller which compresses universal representations while making them more robust against environmental artifacts via a multi-task learning objective. The proposed layer-wise distillation recipe is evaluated on top of three well-established universal representations, as well as with three downstream tasks. Experimental results show the proposed methodology applied on top of the WavLM Base+ teacher model outperforming all other benchmarks across noise types and levels, as well as reverberation times. Oftentimes, the obtained results with the student model (24M parameters) achieved results inline with those of the teacher model (95M).},

  abstract={Prompt-based learning has improved the few-shot learning performance of large-scale Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Yet, it is challenging to deploy large-scale PLMs in resource-constrained environments for online applications. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a promising approach for PLM compression. However, distilling prompt-tuned PLMs in the few-shot learning setting is a non-trivial problem due to the lack of task-specific training data and KD techniques for the new prompting paradigm. We propose Prompt-Distiller, the first few-shot KD algorithm for prompt-tuned PLMs, which forces the student model to learn from both its pre-trained and prompt-tuned teacher models to alleviate the model overfitting problem. We further design a contrastive learning technique to learn higher-order dependencies from intermediate-layer representations of teacher models, considering different knowledge capacities of teacher and student models. Extensive experiments over various datasets show that Prompt-Distiller consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin.},

  abstract={This work studies knowledge distillation (KD) and addresses its constraints for recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) models. In hard distillation, a teacher model transcribes large amounts of unlabelled speech to train a student model. Soft distillation is another popular KD method that distills the output logits of the teacher model. Due to the nature of RNN-T alignments, applying soft distillation between RNNT architectures having different posterior distributions is challenging. In addition, bad teachers having high word-error-rate (WER) reduce the efficacy of KD. We investigate how to effectively distill knowledge from variable quality ASR teachers, which has not been studied before to the best of our knowledge. We show that a sequence-level KD, full-sum distillation, outperforms other distillation methods for RNN-T models, especially for bad teachers. We also propose a variant of full-sum distillation that distills the sequence discriminative knowledge of the teacher leading to further improvement in WER. We conduct experiments on public datasets namely SpeechStew and LibriSpeech, and on in-house production data.},

  abstract={Fall accidents are critical issues in an aging and aged society. Recently, many researchers developed "pre-impact fall detection systems" using deep learning to support wearable-based fall protection systems for preventing severe injuries. However, most works only employed simple neural network models instead of complex models considering the usability in resource-constrained mobile devices and strict latency requirements. In this work, we propose a novel pre-impact fall detection via CNN-ViT knowledge distillation, namely PreFallKD, to strike a balance between detection performance and computational complexity. The proposed PreFallKD transfers the detection knowledge from the pre-trained teacher model (vision transformer) to the student model (lightweight convolutional neural networks). Additionally, we apply data augmentation techniques to tackle issues of data imbalance. We conduct the experiment on the KFall public dataset and compare PreFallKD with other state-of-the-art models. The experiment results show that PreFallKD could boost the student model during the testing phase and achieves reliable F1-score (92.66%) and lead time (551.3 ms).},

In this paper, we focus on knowledge distillation for the RNN-T model, which is widely used in state-of-the-art (SoTA) automatic speech recognition (ASR). Specifically, we compared using soft and hard target distillation to train large-scale RNN-T models on the LibriSpeech/LibriLight public dataset (60k hours) and our in-house data (600k hours). We found that hard targets are more effective when the teacher and student have different architecture, such as large teacher and small streaming student. On the other hand, soft target distillation works better in self-training scenario like iterative large teacher training. For a large model with 0.6B weights, we achieve a new SoTA word error rate (WER) on LibriSpeech (8% relative improvement on dev-other) using Noisy Student Training with soft target distillation. It also allows our production teacher to adapt new data domain continuously.},

  abstract={As an important work in computer vision, some recent representative works such as Two-stream networks, 3D ConvNets, and Transformer-based networks have achieved outstanding performance. However, due to the high computational cost, the explosion of computation time and parameters, they cannot meet the needs of real-time applications. The current work utilizes the keyframes, residual and motion information retained by compressed video for computation, which greatly reduces the computational effort but still cannot satisfy real-time applications. Therefore, we propose a multi-teacher fusion distillation framework for compressed video action recognition (MTFD). Unlike the traditional method of transferring the knowledge of single or multiple teachers directly into the student model, we also perform knowledge transfer between teachers. MTFD achieves better knowledge distillation through mutual guidance and information fusion between teachers. Furthermore, we improve the network’s ability to extract motion information, which ultimately reduces the computational effort while maintaining high accuracy.},

  abstract={The current lyrics transcription approaches heavily rely on supervised learning with labeled data, but such data are scarce and manual labeling of singing is expensive. How to benefit from unlabeled data and alleviate limited data problem have not been explored for lyrics transcription. We propose the first semi-supervised lyrics transcription paradigm, Self-Transcriber, by leveraging on unlabeled data using selftraining with noisy student augmentation. We attempt to demonstrate the possibility of lyrics transcription with a few amount of labeled data. Self-Transcriber generates pseudo labels of the unlabeled singing using teacher model, and augments pseudo-labels to the labeled data for student model update with both self-training and supervised training losses. This work closes the gap between supervised and semi- supervised learning as well as opens doors for few-shot learning of lyrics transcription. Our experiments show that our approach using only 12.7 hours of labeled data achieves competitive performance compared with the supervised approaches trained on 149.1 hours of labeled data for lyrics transcription.},

The traditional KD technique focuses only on distilling dark knowledge using logits of a teacher network while neglecting the information regarding contrastive representation. To this end, we propose a new KD loss function that enables a student network to learn informative contrastive distribution and fine grained information from spectrogram representation of a signal thus enhancing performance of a student network for sound classification task. The experiments are conducted on two benchmark sound classification datasets, viz. ESC-10 and Audio MNIST, which illustrates that the student network trained using the proposed KD loss function outperformed the competitive KD techniques.},

  abstract={The accurate segmentation of the right and left ventricles with limited labeled data is a challenging task in echocardiographic data analysis. To fully leverage the easily accessible unlabeled data, we propose a label-decoupling teacher-student framework (LDTSF) based on semi-supervised learning. Specifically, the decoupled deep network within LDTSF jointly predicts pixel-wise segmentation maps, level set-based edge regression maps, target skeleton maps and target detail maps to focus on edge pixels. Several micro-task-transformable layers are used to map multi-task representations to a unified space in order to supervise the consistency among multiple tasks using massive unlabeled data. In addition, we first train a teacher model based on semi-supervised learning strategy, and then use the pseudo-labels generated by the teacher model together with the original labels to train a student model. Experiments on our self-collected 3D echocardiographic dataset and a publicly available MRI dataset show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods. The code will be available at: https://github.com/SwanKnightZJP/LDTSF.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD) is a machine learning technique widely used in recent years for the task of domain adaptation and complexity reduction. It relies on a Student-Teacher mechanism to transfer the knowledge of a large and complex Teacher network into a smaller Student model. Given the inherent complexity of large Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, and the need for deployment on edge devices with limited resources, complexity reduction techniques have become a hot topic in the Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) community. Recent literature in NILM has devoted increased effort to domain adaptation and architecture reduction via KD. However, the mechanism behind the transfer of knowledge from the Teacher to the Student is not clearly understood. In this work, we aim to address the aforementioned issue by placing the KD NILM approach in a framework of explainable AI (XAI). We identify the main inconsistency in the transfer of explainable knowledge, and exploit this information to propose a method for improvement of KD through explainability guided learning. We evaluate our approach on a variety of appliances and domain adaptation scenarios and demonstrate that solving inconsistencies in the transfer of explainable knowledge can lead to improvement in predictive performance.},

  abstract={Gun violence and misuse pose great threat to the public safety. Real-time monitoring of gun usage and gunshot events are very promising for effective gun control. However, most available monitoring systems are installed in a fixed location instead of the guns, which greatly limits the flexibility and coverage. In this study, we propose a wireless gun monitoring and gunshot recognition system based on a low-cost triaxial acceleration sensor, which can monitor the gun in real time and accurately recognize gunshot events. Addressing the limited resources of the embedded systems, we further propose an efficient gunshot recognition algorithm EfficientNetTime that combines the lightweight neural network and knowledge distillation, so as to enable the deployment on embedded devices. First, a novel lightweight deep learning model is proposed as the basic model, which combines the advantages of 1-D convolution and depthwise separable convolution to effectively characterize the gunshot signal while decreasing the computing cost of convolution. Second, using the knowledge distillation, EfficientNetTime is used as the teacher model to generate a compressed student model that maintains accuracy and greatly reducing model size. Finally, the EfficientNetTime student model can be deployed on resource-limited embedded systems. The proposed method can automatically extract features for end-to-end recognition and is robust to temporal transformations of input signals. Using a publicly available gunshot data set, the proposed EfficientNetTime model is verified and compared against the state-of-the-art models. Experimental results demonstrate that the EfficientNetTime model surpasses other gunshot recognition methods in terms of the accuracy and model size.},

Methods and procedures: Our framework replicates the elderly home in digital space which can provide an unobtrusive way to monitor the resident&ahat;s daily life activities. The learning challenges posed by different performed activities at home are solved by introducing the deep meta-class sequence model. The notion is to group the set of activities into a single meta-class according to the nature of the activities. It helps the learning process, which is based on long short-term memory (LSTM) to learn feature space abstraction. Each meta-class abstraction is further decomposed to an individual activity performed by the elderly at home. Results: The experiments are carried out over the Center for Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems dataset and proposed model outperforms as compared to baseline models. Clinical impact: Our findings demonstrate a robust framework to digitally monitor the elderly behavior, which is beneficial for healthcare practitioners to understand the level of support the elderly needed to perform the daily tasks or potential risk of an emergency in their own homes.},

  volume={27},
  number={8},
  pages={3912-3923},
  abstract={Semi-supervised learning is becoming an effective solution in medical image segmentation because annotations are costly and tedious to acquire. Methods based on the teacher-student model use consistency regularization and uncertainty estimation and have shown good potential in dealing with limited annotated data. Nevertheless, the existing teacher-student model is seriously limited by the exponential moving average algorithm, which leads to the optimization trap. Moreover, the classic uncertainty estimation method calculates the global uncertainty for images but does not consider local region-level uncertainty, which is unsuitable for medical images with blurry regions. In this article, the Voxel Stability and Reliability Constraint (VSRC) model is proposed to address these issues. Specifically, the Voxel Stability Constraint (VSC) strategy is introduced to optimize parameters and exchange effective knowledge between two independent initialized models, which can break through the performance bottleneck and avoid model collapse. Moreover, a new uncertainty estimation strategy, the Voxel Reliability Constraint (VRC), is proposed for use in our semi-supervised model to consider the uncertainty at the local region level. We further extend our model to auxiliary tasks and propose a task-level consistency regularization with uncertainty estimation. Extensive experiments on two 3D medical image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods under limited supervision.},

  abstract={Personalization is one of the primary emerging trends in Industry 4.0 and Beyond. Highly personalized services will present a significant challenge to the existing algorithms for network slicing (NS) and resource allocation, leading to issues, such as nonequilibratory resource allocation, in which some services are sacrificed for the maximum total reward of the algorithm, excessive cost, and slow algorithm convergence. A digital twin network (DTN) is offered as a novel solution to the challenges listed above. By integrating the DTN and IIoT NS, we propose a DTN-assisted industry Internet of Things NS (DTN-IIoT NS) architecture for personalized IIoT services in Industry 4.0 and Beyond. The DTN-IIoT NS architecture consists of three layers, three modules, and two closed loops. On the basis of the aforementioned architecture, we focus on the resource allocation process in DTN-IIoT NS, model the DT-assisted resource allocation for highly personalized IIoT services, propose the service equilibrium rate, and formulate the optimization problem aiming at maximizing the equilibrium rate weighted net profit of network providers. Then, we propose a dual-channel weighted (DCW) Critic network for service equilibrium in DTN-IIoT NS resource allocation and the matching Improved prioritized experience replay (PER) to enhance convergent speed. In addition, we present a distributed DT-assisted DCW-PER multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (PER-DCW MADDPG) algorithm for the resource allocation process in DTN-IIoT NS. Simulation results indicate that the PER-DCW MADDPG algorithm can produce a better service equilibrium and accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm.},

  abstract={In this Internet of Things (IoT) era, the number of devices capable of sensing their surroundings is increasing day by day. Based on the data from these devices, numerous services and systems are now offered where critical decisions depend on the data collected by sensors. Therefore, error-free data are most desirable, but due to extreme operating environments, the possibility of faults occurring in sensors is high. So, detecting faults in data obtained by sensors is important. In this article, a digital twin (DT)-inspired detection approach is proposed, and its ability to detect a single type of fault in several sensors is analyzed. The digital equivalent of the sensor is developed using a generative adversarial network (GAN). As GANs inherently perform well with images, Gramian angular field (GAF) encoding is used to convert time series data to images. The GAF encoding preserves the temporal relations of the time series data. The GAN is trained with the GAF images. The trained GAN model acts as the virtual representation of the sensor, and the discriminator network of the GAN model, once it has learned the pattern of normal data, is used as the fault detector. The performance of the virtual sensor is promising because it successfully generates data for normal conditions. The best fault detection accuracy achieved by the proposed model is 98.7%, which makes this GAN-based DT-inspired approach a promising candidate for sensor fault detection.},

  abstract={Many applications involving physical systems, such as system control or fault detection, call for a behavioral, black-box, or digital twin of the real system. By observing input-output pairs, a nonlinear system’s black-box twinning model can be built, thus enabling real-time accurate estimation of the system’s health and status. We propose a modeling approach that can be implemented with little hardware resources and predicts system output with acceptable accuracy for a wide range of applications in the IoT and Industry 4.0 application domains, such as cloud and distributed predictive control, maintenance, fault detection, and model drift avoidance. This approach consists of building a compact numerical model, based on the concept of sum-decomposability, with reduced computational complexity and memory requirements, well suited for microcontroller-based IoT applications. The black-box modeling theory, the sizing process, and the learning method are reported. The outputs of two examples of non-linear systems are replicated in real-time using a pioneer experimental setup built around a microcontroller. According to experimental results, online learning and prediction are performed at 1 kS/s with a prediction error comparable to the resolution of the digitalized input-output data. The reduced size of the obtained model calls for real-time sharing and update with cloud and edge-based simulation ecosystems enabling a near real-time digital twinning of field systems.},

By manipulating its own dataset and training machine learning models locally, federated learning (FL) has been regarded as a promising technology to establish DT models for IIoT. Nevertheless, the vast amount of model parameters, limited computation and communication resources, and the dynamic industrial environments pose great challenges for FL. In this paper, we present a novel FL framework integrating with DTs in the resource-constrained and dynamic IIoT environment. The clustering algorithm is exploited to design an efficient client selection approach. Furthermore, we propose an efficient model aggregation approach to improve the training efficiency. A resource allocation problem is then formulated and solved based on deep reinforcement learning. Numerical results show that the proposed client selection and resource allocation approach reduces the time cost compared with the baseline schemes.},

  abstract={Monocular depth estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision. Due to the costly acquisition of depth ground truth, self-supervised methods that leverage adjacent frames to establish a supervision signal have emerged as the most promising paradigms. In this work, we propose two novel ideas to improve self-supervised monocular depth estimation: 1) self-reference distillation and 2) disparity offset refinement. Specifically, we use a parameter-optimized model as the teacher updated as the training epochs to provide additional supervision during the training process. The teacher model has the same structure as the student model, with weights inherited from the historical student model. In addition, a multiview check is introduced to filter out the outliers produced by the teacher model. Furthermore, we leverage the contextual consistency between high-level and low-level features to obtain multiscale disparity offsets, which are used to refine the disparity output incrementally by aligning disparity information at different scales. The experimental results on the KITTI and Make3D datasets show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art competitors.},

Sharing road data among vehicles effectively can greatly improve their driving efficiency and road experience. This, however, is hindered by security concerns, bandwidth limitations, and mobility and communication distance between vehicles. In this article, we propose a citywide data sharing platform among vehicles based on the digital twin. Specifically, we propose a digital twin based vehicular platform on the cloud to facilitate the effective data sharing of vehicles. A digital twin is a digital representation of a vehicle on the cloud that synchronises data with the vehicle in real time. Therefore, data sharing among vehicles can be accomplished by their digital twins on the cloud without any physical limitations. Considering the data privacy of vehicles, a framework that combines federated learning and transfer learning is applied which can realise personalised data sharing among vehicles without disclosing their data privacy. An incentive mechanism based on the game-theoretic approach is devised to combat the mutual distrust between vehicles and encourage their contribution to data sharing. By sewing the above mechanisms, the proposed digital twin enabled data sharing platform can effectively address privacy, bandwidth limitation and incentive issues. Using extensive trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system.},

  abstract={Owing to its inherently dynamic nature and economical training cost, offline reinforcement learning (RL) is typically employed to implement an interactive recommender system (IRS). A crucial challenge in offline RL-based IRSs is the data sparsity issue, i.e., it is hard to mine user preferences well from the limited number of user-item interactions. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-enhanced causal reinforcement learning model (KCRL) to mitigate data sparsity in IRSs. We make technical extensions to the offline RL framework in terms of the reward function and state representation. Specifically, we first propose a group preference-injected causal user model (GCUM) to learn user satisfaction (i.e., reward) estimation. We introduce beneficial group preference information, namely, the group effect, via causal inference to compensate for incomplete user interests extracted from sparse data. Then, we learn the RL recommendation policy with the reward given by the GCUM. We propose a knowledge-enhanced state encoder (KSE) to generate knowledge-enriched user state representations at each time step, which is assisted by a self-constructed user-item knowledge graph. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the baselines.},

  abstract={Digital twins capable of quality of transmission (QoT) estimation and prediction are powerful tools for efficient design and operation of optical networks. In this paper, we employ machine learning techniques to enhance both the QoT estimation and prediction capabilities of an optical network digital twin. By leveraging a method to infer or refine the unknown lumped loss distributions and amplifier gain spectra for accurate characterization of the current optical network state, the accuracy of estimation and prediction is substantially improved. For QoT prediction, we further develop a novel neural-network architecture for erbium-doped fiber amplifiers that, after factory training on a single device and with fully loaded configurations only, generalizes to partially loaded configurations seen after deployment and to different gain and tilt settings and other physical devices of the same type. We combine refined parameters and a novel method that predicts the difference in per-channel power when individual services are added or removed or multiple services are lost due to a fiber cut. The impact of error amplification due to cascading of individual components’ models is shown to be reduced, yielding predictions that are substantially more accurate than simply cascaded predictions. As the network ages, the digital twin can be updated by retraining while using only information available in the current network state.},

  abstract={In industry, accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is critical in improving system reliability and reducing downtime and accident risk. Numerous data-driven RUL prediction approaches have been proposed and achieved impressive performance in RUL prediction. However, most of them are still faced with the dilemma of limited samples, and most of popular transfer learning and domain adaptive methods adopt single-source domain adaptation (DA), ignoring the domain-shift within source domain and failing to fully utilize the multi-condition data. This article proposes a model-data fusion life prediction method based on digital twin (DT) and multi-source regression adversarial domain adaptation (MRADA) to address the aforementioned issues. For data-driven life prediction model, the model-based DT technology among them offers a significant amount of multi-condition training data. The proposed MRADA fully utilizes the benefits of DT simulation data by using intra-group alignment strategy, inter-group alignment strategy, adversarial learning, and regressor alignment strategy to learn domain-invariant features and supervision from multiple sources. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed fusion life prediction method can successfully address the issue of small samples and improve the accuracy of rolling bearing life prediction results.},

  abstract={Ultra-high Voltage Direct Current system (UHVDC) can realize long distance transmission, and its loss measurement has great significance for loss reduction and fault diagnosis. Currently, loss measurements can be performed by model-driven and data-driven approaches. However, poor operating conditions can lead to system sensing errors, which can significantly reduce the accuracy and speed of measurement. To deal with this problem, we propose a digital twin architecture and constructs a data-driven learning model. The model, DTformer, is embedded in the digital twin architecture. And it has three remarkable processes: encoder-decoder based random feature extraction, loss measurement transfer learning and knowledge distillation. These processes extract parameter information and topology features from the data of UHVDC. The model has good accuracy, response time and resistance to the missing data. The comparison experiment shows that DTformer outperforms popular feature extraction models with an average decrease of 38.80% in RMSE and 42.82% in MAE, and the best R2 value is closest to 1. The analyses of lightweight and missingness show that the DTformer also has significant response time improvement and missing resistance. Finally, we also implement the visualization of digital twin to enable operators to perform monitoring, computation, analysis and management of UHVDC.},

In this article, we propose an incentive-based federated learning scheme for digital twin (DT)-driven industrial mobile crowdsensing. Specifically, we first design a DT-driven industrial mobile crowdsensing architecture to achieve dynamic perception of the complex IIoT environment, among heterogeneous and resource-constrained mobile clients. Second, we develop a novel incentive-based federated learning framework incorporated with a contract-based reputation mechanism and a Stackelberg-based interclient incentive mechanism, to optimize the model accuracy. Third, we devise a knowledge distillation algorithm for the federated learning framework, to address the heterogeneity of nonindependent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. Extensive experiments on both MNIST/FEMNIST and CIFAR10/100 data sets demonstrate the outperformance of our proposed scheme, in terms of model accuracy, incentive fairness, and data compatibility, compared to state-of-the-art studies.},

  abstract={In order to facilitate rapid prototyping and testing in the advanced motorsport industry, we consider the problem of imitating and outperforming professional race car drivers based on demonstrations collected on a high-fidelity Driver-in-the-Loop (DiL) hardware simulator. We formulate a contextual reinforcement learning problem to learn a human-like and stochastic policy with domain-informed choices for states, actions, and reward functions. To leverage very limited training data and build human-like diverse behavior, we fit a probabilistic model to the expert demonstrations called the reference distribution, draw samples out of it, and use them as context for the reinforcement learning agent with context-specific states and rewards. In contrast to the non-human-like stochasticity introduced by Gaussian noise, our method contributes to a more effective exploration, better performance and a policy with human-like variance in evaluation metrics. Compared to previous work using a behavioral cloning agent, which is unable to complete competitive laps robustly, our agent outperforms the professional driver used to collect the demonstrations by around 0.4 seconds per lap on average, which is the first time known to the authors that an autonomous agent has outperformed a top-class professional race driver in a state-of-the-art, high-fidelity simulation. Being robust and sensitive to vehicle setup changes, our agent is able to predict plausible lap time and other performance metrics. Furthermore, unlike traditional lap time calculation methods, our agent indicates not only the gain in performance but also the driveability when faced with modified car balance, facilitating the digital twin of the DiL simulation.},

  year={2023},
  volume={42},
  number={11},
  pages={3269-3282},
  abstract={Semi-supervised learning via teacher-student network can train a model effectively on a few labeled samples. It enables a student model to distill knowledge from the teacher’s predictions of extra unlabeled data. However, such knowledge flow is typically unidirectional, having the accuracy vulnerable to the quality of teacher model. In this paper, we seek to robust 3D reconstruction of stereo endoscopic images by proposing a novel fashion of bidirectional learning between two learners, each of which can play both roles of teacher and student concurrently. Specifically, we introduce two self-supervisions, i.e., Adaptive Cross Supervision (ACS) and Adaptive Parallel Supervision (APS), to learn a dual-branch convolutional neural network. The two branches predict two different disparity probability distributions for the same position, and output their expectations as disparity values. The learned knowledge flows across branches along two directions: a cross direction (disparity guides distribution in ACS) and a parallel direction (disparity guides disparity in APS). Moreover, each branch also learns confidences to dynamically refine its provided supervisions. In ACS, the predicted disparity is softened into a unimodal distribution, and the lower the confidence, the smoother the distribution. In APS, the incorrect predictions are suppressed by lowering the weights of those with low confidence. With the adaptive bidirectional learning, the two branches enjoy well-tuned mutual supervisions, and eventually converge on a consistent and more accurate disparity estimation. The experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate our superior accuracy over other state-of-the-arts with a relative decrease of averaged disparity error by at least 9.76%.},

  pages={51229-51240},
  abstract={Multimodal transfer learning aims to transform pretrained representations of diverse modalities into a common domain space for effective multimodal fusion. However, conventional systems are typically built on the assumption that all modalities exist, and the lack of modalities always leads to poor inference performance. Furthermore, extracting pretrained embeddings for all modalities is computationally inefficient for inference. In this work, to achieve high efficiency-performance multimodal transfer learning, we propose VideoAdviser, a video knowledge distillation method to transfer multimodal knowledge of video-enhanced prompts from a multimodal fundamental model (teacher) to a specific modal fundamental model (student). With an intuition that the best learning performance comes with professional advisers and smart students, we use a CLIP-based teacher model to provide expressive multimodal knowledge supervision signals to a RoBERTa-based student model via optimizing a step-distillation objective loss—first step: the teacher distills multimodal knowledge of video-enhanced prompts from classification logits to a regression logit—second step: the multimodal knowledge is distilled from the regression logit of the teacher to the student. We evaluate our method in two challenging multimodal tasks: video-level sentiment analysis (MOSI and MOSEI datasets) and audio-visual retrieval (VEGAS dataset). The student (requiring only the text modality as input) achieves an MAE score improvement of up to 12.3% for MOSI and MOSEI. Our method further enhances the state-of-the-art method by 3.4% mAP score for VEGAS without additional computations for inference. These results suggest the strengths of our method for achieving high efficiency-performance multimodal transfer learning.},

  abstract={The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is a precision mechatronic system for nanoscale imaging of surfaces. Due to limited instrument access and lack of visualization techniques, understanding its principles can be challenging. Digital twin technology allows the creation of virtual representations of physical systems, which can be particularly useful to address challenges in AFM education. To realistically simulate nanoscale physics, we first developed new efficient algorithms for four virtual scale models, including cantilever mechanics, probe transducers, controller tuning, and contact mechanics. Second, three simulated experiment interactive learning modules are developed for instrument operation, including virtual imaging, system overview, and imaging modalities. In the end, three hardware systems are integrated for an extended reality experience, including a macroscopic AFM scale model, a haptic device for probe-sample interaction force feedback, and an upgraded low-cost educational AFM for nanoscale imaging and instrumentation. This completes the eight total modules for the AFM SMILER: A scale model interactive learning extended reality toolkit. Preliminary studies show the toolkit being helpful for AFM education. In addition to mechatronics and nanotechnology education, techniques developed in this work can be generally applied to computationally efficient realistic digital twin creation.},

  pages={3338-3353},
  abstract={Unsupervised person re-identification is a challenging and promising task in computer vision. Nowadays unsupervised person re-identification methods have achieved great progress by training with pseudo labels. However, how to purify feature and label noise is less explicitly studied in the unsupervised manner. To purify the feature, we take into account two types of additional features from different local views to enrich the feature representation. The proposed multi-view features are carefully integrated into our cluster contrast learning to leverage more discriminative cues that the global feature easily ignored and biased. To purify the label noise, we propose to take advantage of the knowledge of teacher model in an offline scheme. Specifically, we first train a teacher model from noisy pseudo labels, and then use the teacher model to guide the learning of our student model. In our setting, the student model could converge fast with the supervision of the teacher model thus reduce the interference of noisy labels as the teacher model greatly suffered. After carefully handling the noise and bias in the feature learning, our purification modules are proven to be very effective for unsupervised person re-identification. Extensive experiments on two popular person re-identification datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Especially, our approach achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy 85.8% @mAP and 94.5% @Rank-1 on the challenging Market-1501 benchmark with ResNet-50 under the fully unsupervised setting.

However, the fidelity and reliability of DT software are essential to represent the physical world. This paper shows an automated and systematic test architecture for DT that correlates DT states with real-time sensor data from a production line in the forging industry. Our evaluation shows that the architecture can significantly accelerate the automatic DT testing process and improve its reliability. A systematic online DT testing method can significantly detect the performance shift and continuously improve the DT’s fidelity.

Two portable hybrid unified models of the scaled demonstration system were developed with incorporated machine learning techniques to show improved autonomous control.

  abstract={Packet loss inferring can enable a transceiver to distinguish between channel impairment and collision for transmission failures, and thus can improve the network performance by exclusively performing rate adaptation or adjusting the medium access parameter. Machine learning methods from literature have shown great potential in producing models that can detect the loss causes over various network trace, however haven't considered accurate data-driven loss inferring on resource-constrained devices that cannot accommodate deep models. In this paper, we propose a novel packet loss inferring framework that can train lightweight models to distinguish between channel losses and collisions by learning the data trace from both simulation and real devices. Specifically, we first train a sophisticated teacher model based on extensive simulation datasets, whose knowledge is then transferred to a small student model that can be deployed on tiny device. The simulation-reality distillation is conducted via personalized trace from each client correspondingly, whose performance bound is analytically guaranteed. We have implemented our method on real testbed and show that the network access performance can be significantly improved, especially for sudden network variations.},

Tracking of machine health, maintenance through prediction, and scheduling of production are the three main issues facing any industrial sector. Smart manufacturing can address the aforementioned issues by using data-driven deep learning techniques. The model to effectively address the aforementioned difficulties is developed using the deep convolutional LSTM encoder-decoder architecture. LSTM auto-encoder, a feed-forward neural network whose input signal is equal to its output signal, can be used to predict the machine's speed. To put it another way, an auto encoder is an individual research algorithm that uses input data without a labeled target dataset to extract features.

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) enables intelligent services varying with the complex and realtime environment to achieve network benefits, where network function virtualization (NFV) can dynamically provide virtualized network functions (VNFs) for IoT devices. In the NFV-enabled IoT architecture, a service function chain (SFC) consists of an ordered set of VNFs. However, the energy consumption of the VNF migration and SFC reconfiguration is one major issue owing to the dynamic characteristic of the IoT network. In this article, we propose a new paradigm digital twin (DT) to create the virtual twin of physical objects in the IoT network, then, we formalize the problem as a mathematical model, which aims to minimize the energy consumption. To this end, we prove this problem is NP-hard and propose an algorithm bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) based on federated learning to predict the resource requirement. Further more, according to the prediction result, which utilizing the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for decision making of the VNF migration. Simulation results show that our proposed method can effectively reduce the number of VNFs to be migrated and economize the energy consumption of the DT IoT network.},

  abstract={Traffic classification, which deduces task-relevant traffic types, is required for network management, security, and quality of service (QoS). In recent studies, deep learning has been used to distinguish encrypted traffic without using handcraft features. However, higher-performance deep learning models often come with a significant computational overhead and parameter count. In this article, we present a novel cross-modal fusion model, CMFTC, which achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model DISTILLER, but with only 18% of its parameters and half the floating-point operations (FLOPs). The CMFTC model is designed to carefully capture the relationship between different modalities and employs a lightweight design for efficient computation. Our model achieves better performance by fusing packet, context, and flow-level modalities. Additionally, we propose a pair of homogeneous student and teacher models with similar architectures, and we adjust the distillation algorithm to improve the student model's inference speed without compromising performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the current SOTA on several benchmark datasets, including Ton_IoT, IoT-23, ISCX-Tor-2016, ISCX-VPN-2016, and USTC-TFC, with significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs. Furthermore, our model has a better inference speed on real IoT devices, as demonstrated by our experiments.},

  abstract={The edge of the Internet of Things (IoT), which consists of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), is vulnerable to network intrusion because software and wireless connections are used extensively in the IoT. Designing an efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) model is imperative. However, when creating IDS models with distributed data collected by UAVs, it is necessary to take precautions to protect the data’s security and privacy. Furthermore, most of the IDS models are focused on one-time learning but not on continuous learning. To this end, we propose a federated continuous learning framework with a stacked broad learning system (FCL-SBLS) based on the digital twin network (DTN), which can learn and train the IDS model on new data quickly and continuously. In order to improve the efficiency and quality of the IDS model when training and aggregation, we employ an asynchronous federated learning (FL) architecture, and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based UAV selection scheme assisted by DTN is proposed to help the global IDS model aggregation. The presented algorithm is validated using the CIC-IDS2017 data set, and the simulation results reveal that our algorithm achieves higher efficiency and accuracy than the existing FL scheme.},

  abstract={Maritime industries desire high speed and reliability, low lifespan cost, and environmental impact shipping for transportation. Compared to highly congested land shipments and high-cost air freight, all-electric ship (AES) can reduce the lifespan energy consumption and transport a considerable freight volume at a lower rate. Recently, the medium voltage dc (MVDC) topology, recommended by IEEE standard, pushes the AES to the next stage in considering space and weight constraints with the reduction of bulky transformers and simplified parallel connections. However, device-level modeling of this massive parallel MVDC-based ship-board microgrid (SBM) is challenging to both the state-of-the-art general-purpose compute unit and traditional electromagnetic transient (EMT)-based emulation. With the rapid development of machine learning (ML) algorithm and its dedicated execution unit, accelerated parallel emulation becomes achievable in different levels of this paralleled connected SBM. Applying the ML-aided technique can help to improve the emulation execution efficiency and reduce the consumption of hardware resource on the field-programmable gate arrays. This work proposes a real-time hybrid ML-EMT-based digital twin of the complete SBM at the subsystem-level and equipment-level with validated results from PSCAD/EMTDC, and device-level with validated results from SaberRD.},

  year={2023},
  volume={24},

  pages={11157-11170},
  abstract={Point cloud semantic segmentation for railway infrastructures is an essential step towards establishing railway digital twins. Deep learning-based methods have shown great potential in this field compared to traditional methods that rely on hand-crafted features. However, deep learning-based methods for railway point clouds still face typical challenges that need to be addressed. In this regard, we propose a novel learning framework named SALAProNet, which consists of a set of effective and concise modular solutions. The first challenge addressed is the massive data scale of railway point clouds, which makes it difficult to directly process large-scale point clouds due to memory limitations. To solve this problem, we adapt efficient random sampling in the network and propose the Self-Attentive Aggregation (SAA) module based on an attention mechanism to greatly expand the receptive field, which covers the unsampled points and successfully retains information in a high-dimensional feature space. The second challenge is fine-grained segmentation, where we propose the Local Geometry Embedding (LGE) module to embed local geometry. With the help of context information provided by SAA, the network can perform fine-grained segmentation for railway infrastructures. The third challenge is the insufficient generalization ability of the network, where we propose a Prototype Guided Regularization (PGR) method to guide the network to segment the point cloud among railways with different construction standards. This method enhances the network’s interpretability and improves its generalization ability. We have validated our proposed framework through experiments on different datasets, and it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract={Satellite orbit prediction has important applications in the field of space situation awareness, such as space collision warning and observation scheduling. The expansion of space information network challenges the low delay, high-accuracy transmission and real-time response of satellite orbit prediction tasks. The traditional orbit prediction process is affected by the measurement error, the estimation error, the unmodeled orbit perturbation and other factors, resulting in low accuracy orbit prediction results. In order to meet the requirements of high accuracy requirements, we built a satellite digital twin system based on the Docker container to predict, optimize and control the satellite orbit status in low consumption. The proposed digital twin system uses the container technology to build each module, which makes the updating of the orbit prediction model more convenient. In addition, in the designed digital twin system, we present an orbit error prediction model based on machine learning. Compared with the traditional physical dynamic model, the proposed machine learning model can effectively correct the error value of orbit prediction and improve the accuracy of orbit prediction. Finally, the validity of the corresponding model is verified in the simulation environment.},

  abstract={Widespread applications based on the Internet of Things (IoT) are driving the adoption of digital twins (DTs) to optimize operations and increase efficiency. However, the development of DT-empowered IoT systems has put forward a series of new requirements for the in-depth mining of comprehensive data. The first is how to ensure that the fusion results of data from a large number of connected physical and virtual entities scattered in heterogeneous networks are always better than data from the physical or virtual world alone. The second is how to effectively coordinate the interaction between physical entities and virtual entities to optimize the operation and management of IoT services. This article proposes a novel DT architecture to build various feature-rich virtual entities, and introduces a new concept of DT data liquidity to orchestrate physical-to-physical, physical-to-virtual, and virtual-to-virtual interactions of intelligent IoT functions. A federated learning method based on a two-phase optimization scheme is also developed to optimize the data liquidity of the DT system through orchestrated cloud-edge-device DT collaboration to provide high fault tolerance and reliability IoT services. Performance evaluation results on the CIRFAR10-LT benchmark and two real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence, accuracy and generalization ability.},

  abstract={The combination of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Digital Twin (DT) is anticipated to enhance the quality of mobile application services in the 6G era. However, current research often overlooks service caching and task dependency, which may deteriorate system performance. Moreover, Edge Servers (ESs) have limited computing resources and caching capacities, which require collaboration to meet user demands. To address these challenges, we propose a DT-empowered MEC architecture that supports Mobile Users (MUs) offloading dependency-aware tasks, while considering service caching and edge collaboration. The objective is to jointly optimize computation offloading and resource allocation to minimize the system’s energy consumption. Hence, this problem can be formulated as a Mixed Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) problem and addressed by utilizing the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)-based method. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other benchmark algorithms under various scenarios, significantly reducing energy consumption.},

  abstract={Digital Twin is the seamless data integration between a physical and virtual machine in either direction. Emotion recognition in healthcare is becoming increasingly important due to recent developments in Machine Learning methods. However, it may face technical problems such as limited datasets, occlusion and lighting issues, identifying key features, incorrect emotion classification, high implementation costs, head posture, and a person’s cultural background. This paper proposes a novel approach based on facial expression and body movement recognition for emotion recognition. It uses three devices (Kinect 1, Kinect 2, and RGB HD camera) to construct a new bi-modal database containing 17 participants’ performances of six emotional states. Two mono-modal classifiers have been developed to obtain sufficient state information based on facial expression and body motion analysis. The system’s performance is assessed using three algorithms: Bagged Trees,  $k$ -Nearest Neighbors ( $k$ -NN), and Support Vector Machine (Linear and Cubic). The acquired findings demonstrate the excellent performance of the suggested method and the effectiveness of the proposed features, particularly the combination of 3D distance and 3D angle, in characterising and identifying emotions. Results obtained using Kinect 2 marginally surpass those with Kinect 1. Comparing 2D RGB and RGB-D data reveals that the depth information significantly raises the recognition rate. RGB-D features can be used to represent emotions, but there are discrepancies between RGB and RG-D data.},

  year={2023},
  volume={61},
  number={},
  pages={1-15},
  abstract={Recently, remote sensing image (RSI) semantic segmentation technology has advanced greatly, with the fully supervised process achieving particularly strong performance. However, the technology depends heavily on dataset labels, leading to high annotation costs. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel efficient end-to-end hybrid consistency regularization algorithm (EI-HCR) for the semisupervised semantic segmentation of RSI, wherein only a few labeled images and a large number of unlabeled images are effectively used. First, we devise data perturbation (DP) consistency regularization (CR), which includes a data mix-up method to combine unlabeled and labeled images. Then, we employ teacher and student networks to conduct model perturbation (MP) CR. Both segmentation results are regarded as pseudo-labels for each other. In the end, the semisupervised loss is composed of DP and MP consistency loss and supervises network training along with the fully supervised loss. More importantly, we first combine the characteristics of knowledge distillation to make the student network more lightweight, efficiently reducing the model inference time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EI-HCR on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Massachusetts Buildings datasets. With only 5% of the labeled images, EI-HCR can achieve the same accuracy as the fully supervised training with 50% of the labeled images, and the number of student model parameters is only 9.64 M, indicating the method’s great advantages over other algorithms.},

  abstract={A detailed methodology to develop a digital twin has many useful applications in the era of technology 4.0. This study provides a framework to develop a digital twin for vibration prediction and fatigue life prognosis of a vertical oil well drillstring. The nature and the severity of the down-hole vibrations are identified and estimated based on the vibrational and operational parameter measurements made at the surface level. Because of the difficulty in accessing full-scale industrial drilling data, a reduced-scale drillstring was constructed that could exhibit bit bounce, stick-slip and whirl. A bond graph simulation model was tuned to match the apparatus, and then used to generate synthetic training data. The trained machine learning algorithm can classify the incoming surface monitoring data from the physical twin into different types and severities of vibration states which are not otherwise observable. Moreover, the classified vibration condition is used to re-configure the bond graph model with appropriate complexity to generate a loading history for fatigue life prognosis. The fatigue life estimation uses a novel combination of a low-complexity model of the entire drillstring and a high fidelity finite element model of components where stress concentrations are most severe. The digital twin detected the vibration type and its severity and estimated the remaining fatigue life of the physical system using only measurements of the motor current, rig floor axial vibration, and rotary speed.},

  pages={2461-2475},
  abstract={Most of the voice spoofing detection methods are designed for specific kinds of spoofing attacks, synthetic or replay. In practice, however, there is no prior information about these two kinds of spoofing attacks. To this end, this paper proposes a generalized voice spoofing detection method based on integral knowledge amalgamation to detect jointly synthetic attacks and replay attacks. Two amalgamation mechanisms, feature amalgamation and structure amalgamation, are designed from different perspectives, so that the model can generalize better and run fast. Specifically, the feature amalgamation transfers the high-level sematic knowledge from two teacher models to the compact model. The structure amalgamation employs the adversarial learning to ensure the global structure consistency of two teacher models and a student model. In addition, the feature matching loss is introduced to capture the distinctive features of synthetic attacks and replay attacks. We conduct extensive experiments on logical access (LA) scenario and physical access (PA) scenario of ASVspoof 2019 dataset to verify the validity of the proposed method. The experimental results show that compared with the most advanced generalized voice spoofing detection methods, the proposed method achieves a comparable or even better performance. In particular, our method gains the state-of-the-art detection capability on LA scenario. Moreover, our method achieves similar or even outstanding detectability when compared with specialized anti-spoofing methods.},

The study begins by investigating the key factors that affect the cycle time, including robot movement, tool selection, part handling, and machine setup. Through in-depth analysis and empirical data collection, the paper identifies the critical bottlenecks and inefficiencies that contribute to prolonged cycle times. Based on the identified issues, a systematic optimization approach is proposed to streamline the robot loading process. This approach encompasses various strategies, such as optimizing robot trajectories, implementing intelligent part recognition systems, improving gripper designs, and leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms for real-time decision- making. The paper explores the benefits and implementation challenges associated with each strategy. Furthermore, the study discusses the integration of simulation models and digital twin technologies to predict and optimize the cycle time in a virtual environment. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization approach, experimental evaluations are conducted using a real-world industrial setup same as the one implemented in the manufacturing. The results demonstrate significant cycle time reductions while maintaining high product quality and ensuring worker safety.},

  abstract={The training of 3D medical image segmentation model requires a large amount of labeled data, but the availability of labeled data is difficult, and the scarcity of labeled data makes the prediction quality of unlabeled data cannot be effectively guaranteed. To solve the above problems, the 3D medical image segmentation model UT-MT proposed in this paper combines ViT and CNN, and consists of a student model and a teacher model, and the student model learns the teacher model by minimizing the segmentation loss and consistency loss. By combining the feature learning advantages of CNN and ViT, this method enables the model to enhance the learning ability of taking into account both local and global aspects in feature extraction, and further improves the model accuracy and performance. The evaluation was performed on a public left atrial benchmark dataset, and the results at 10% of the labeled images show that the proposed method improves the Dice coefficient by 6.69% over the fully supervised method and has better segmentation of the boundaries, while our method outperforms five advanced semi-supervised segmentation methods.},

  abstract={The bridge of job scheduling and production equipment maintenance is usually the main joint scheduling task of a production system. However, the predicament of data acquisition in real systems leads to the difficulty of verifying the effectiveness of scheduling algorithms. In order to make joint scheduling work easier to implement in real production systems, this paper presents a joint scheduling framework for production systems based on digital twin and reinforcement learning. Firstly, the virtual mapping of physical production system, namely digital twin system, is established by using AnyLogic software and multi-agent modeling technology. Then, a joint scheduling agent is trained by Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm and the virtual data generated by the twinning system. And the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed framework in production systems with uncertainties, and it has higher production efficiency and lower machine failure frequency compared with a scheduling scheme based on common-used heuristic rules.},

  abstract={In the digital age, the digital twin eliminates physical barriers and risks, facilitating seamless activities in both real and virtual worlds. In the context of additive manufacturing, testing 3D printers can be resource-intensive and prone to printing issues. This research introduces a digital twin-based system that employs the innovative ensemble 3D-AmplifAI algorithm for fault monitoring in 3D printers. The system continuously monitors real-time temperature values and detects faults to prevent potential damage to the printer. Through an ensemble method, the 3D-AmplifAI algorithm combines multiple machine learning models to enhance fault detection in 3D printers. The digital twin environment, developed using Unity, serves as the bridge connecting the physical printer to the virtual world. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art algorithms, including Ridge Regression, XGBoost, InceptionTime, Time Series Transformer (TST), Rocket Ridge, Logistic Regression, Rocket XGBoost, ResNet, and Rocket Ridge Regression, demonstrate the superior performance of the 3D-AmplifAI algorithm in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.},

  pages={318-323},
  abstract={The structural digital twin is a virtual representation of physical entities that accurately predicts the evolution of structural damage through multidisciplinary and multi-level probabilistic simulations. It provides crucial support for prognostic and health management. Flight parameters are important input data for airframe digital twin to support aerodynamic and structural simulations. However, many small aircraft or UAVs often suffer from insufficient sampling rates of flight parameters due to cost limitation or premature service. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based flight data upsampling method that effvbectively enhances the resolution of flight data. The method constructs an upsampling model using a one-dimensional super-resolution convolutional residual network, defines multiple loss functions associated with the flight data, and uses a highly sampled test aircraft dataset for training. The proposed method is validated using real UAV flight test data and several criteria, achieving good results with different upsampling factors. This approach is expected to facilitate the construction of structural digital twins in the future.},

  abstract={Multi-tier computing (MC) utilizes computing resources from the cloud, fog, edge, and end layers to promote intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Federated learning (FL) in MC offers a prospective distributed and privacy-preserving framework to deploy deep learning applications in different layers. Due to time-varying network topologies, wireless channel states, and computational workloads, MC faces a dynamic and uncertain environment, which poses additional challenges to FL task processing. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive training and aggregation federated learning (ATAFL) framework. Specifically, local model training can be performed at end devices, edge nodes, and fog nodes. The global aggregator can choose from the edge, fog, and cloud layers. A joint optimization problem of training, aggregation node selection, and resource allocation is further formulated to minimize system latency and energy consumption. Moreover, digital twin and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques are integrated into the MC network to design optimal node selection and resource allocation strategies based on captured state information of the MC system. We implement a prototype, and experimental results show that our proposed DRL-based algorithm reduces system latency and energy consumption compared with the benchmark algorithms.},

  pages={230-241},
  abstract={This article proposes a digital twin (DT)-based diagnosis and fault-tolerant control for T-type three-level rectifiers. To develop the DT, a dense deep neural network (DNN) machine learning approach is used. The DT is trained offline using a set of experimental data and updated online to get the maximum possible accuracy. Then, the DT is used for the diagnosis and tolerance of open-switch faults (OSFs) and faults related to voltage and current sensors or for sensorless control. The OSF detection and localization algorithm is implemented based on the dynamic response difference between the physical system and its DT. First, the OSF is detected and localized based on the grid current dynamics, where each switch fault generates a specific pattern in the current dynamics. OSF is tolerated by changing the switching function based on the location of the fault. Second, the voltage and current sensor fault is detected when the DT provides a specific amplitude of currents while the physical sensors do not provide a correct measurement. This case is tolerated by feeding back the grid currents or voltages from the DT as an alternative to the physical sensors. The proposed technique has low overhead, enhances the reliability of the power converter, and is applicable for sensorless mode of control. Experimental investigations are conducted to validate the proposed concept.},

  year={2023},
  volume={32},

  pages={882-895},
  abstract={Research on speech enhancement algorithms in the airborne environment is of great significance to the security of airborne systems. Recently, the research focus of speech enhancement has turned from conventional unsupervised algorithms, like the log minimum mean square error estimator (log-MMSE), to the state-of-the-art masking-based long short-term memory (LSTM) method. However, each method has its characteristics and limitations, so they cannot always handle noise well. Besides, the requirements of clean speech and noise data for training a supervised speech enhancement model are difficult to satisfy in the real-world airborne environment. Therefore, in this work, to fully utilize the advantages of those two different methods without any data restrictions, we propose a novel adaptive gain mask (AGM) based teacher-student training approach for speech enhancement. In our method, the AGM, as a robust learning target for the student model, is devised by incorporating the estimated ideal ratio mask from the teacher model into the procedure of the log-MMSE approach. To get an appropriate tradeoff between the two methods, we adaptively update the AGM using a recursive weighting coefficient. Experiments on the real airborne data show that the proposed AGM-based method outperforms other baselines in terms of all essential objective metrics evaluated in this paper.},

  abstract={Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) are computer-based learning systems that use intelligent technologies to provide adaptive learning paths and contents to learners by considering their characteristics and needs. The learner model, which is a representation of different learner’s characteristics, plays a key role in this adaptation. Research on educational psychology showed that emotion and learning have a hidden mutual relationship. If a learning process involves both cognitive and affective dimensions, then learning is like to be more usable, socially appropriate, acceptable and memorable, ultimately leading to significant improvement in the learner’s performance and the learning experience. However, traditional ITS ignore emotional aspects in learner modelling mostly; instead, they focus on learners’ cognition and motivation to maximise the knowledge to be achieved. The characteristics related to cognition are not well defined and primarily sparse when modelling a learner profile tailored to the learning domains. This study attempts to investigate the most common and relevant personal traits involved in the learning process based on the domains of learning. It also explores the most adopted techniques to identify such traits from log files of learners’ interactions with ITS without using physical and physiological sensors (i.e., camera, EEG) to model characteristics learner profiles for ITS aiming to improve its adaptiveness and leverage personalised learning.},

  abstract={Empowered by the advanced 3D sensing, computer vision and AI algorithm, autonomous robotics provide an unprecedented possibility for close-up infrastructure environment inspection in an efficient and reliable fashion. Deep neural network (DNN) learning algorithms, pretrained on the large database can empower real-time object detection as well as fully autonomous, safe robotic navigation in unstructured environments while avoiding the potential obstacle. However, the development and deployment of the robots, inspection planning and operation procedures are still tedious and segmented with tremendous manual intervention during environmental inspection and anomaly monitoring. The proposed digital twin approach is able to provide a virtual representation model of the target environment either from a build-design or from 3D scanning of the real-world physical assets at high resolution in the Unity simulation environment, a transverse drone robot model and test its Robotics Operating System(ROS) autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance software stack, and the hardware-in-the-loop test can thus be conducted for the flight control algorithm effectiveness and real-time object detection performance evaluation. The preliminary result shows that VGG16-UNet deep learning algorithm was able to use only a small amount of guidance and time from experienced inspection pilots to successfully identify the critical elements and defects and real-time navigate around the unstructured environment. The proposed digital twin framework and methodology is promising to be utilized for developing and testing fully autonomous inspection robots and its path planning and navigation and detection operation with greater cost- and time-efficiency.},

  pages={1-14},
  abstract={Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in remote sensing and has been predominantly performed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the past decade. Recently, transformers with self-attention mechanisms have demonstrated superior performance compared with CNNs. However, due to the locality of CNN and the high computational complexity and massive data resource requirements of transformer, neither of them can be well applied in resource-constrained practical remote sensing scenarios. Motivated by the limitations of using either CNNs or transformers alone in the task of semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, a novel cross-model knowledge distillation (KD) framework, named distilling segmenters from CNNs and transformers (DSCTs), is proposed in this article to harness the complementary advantages of both the models. The framework uses a channel-weighted attention-guided feature distillation (CAFD) module to condense the feature from the teacher model and enhance the student model’s focus on the teacher-focused regions. In addition, a target–nontarget KD (TNKD) module is proposed that decouples logit distillation into target and nontarget KD to guide the student model in learning the underlying representations and decision boundaries from the teacher model. By learning the complementary knowledge from the teacher, our proposed DSCT framework improves the student’s segmentation performance without adding trainable parameters. Experiments on four available remote sensing datasets (ISPRS Potsdam, Vaihingen, GID, and LoveDA) indicate that the proposed DSCT outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods and demonstrates its effectiveness and robustness.},

  abstract={As the proliferation of sophisticated task models in 5G empowered digital twin, it yields significant demands on fast and accurate model training over resource-limited wireless networks. It is vital to investigate how to accelerate the training process based on the salient features of practical systems, including heterogeneous data distributions and system resources both across devices and over time. To study the non-trivial coupling between participating device selection and their appropriate training parameters, we first characterize the dependency of convergence performance bound on system parameters, i.e., statistical structure of local data, mini-batch size and gradient quantization level. Based on the theoretical analysis, a training efficiency optimization problem is formulated subject to heterogeneous communication and computation capabilities among devices. To realize online control of training parameters, we propose an adaptive batch-size assisted device scheduling strategy, which prioritizes the selection of devices that offer good data utility and dynamically adjust their mini-batch sizes and gradient quantization levels adapting to network conditions. Simulation results demonstrate our proposed strategy can effectively speed up the training process as compared with benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract={Ultra-high voltage direct current (UHVDC) transmission systems have multiple inputs and multiple outputs, nonlinearity and strong coupling, making it challenging to accurately measure component and system losses using traditional methods based on system mechanisms and simplified modeling of parameters. In this paper, a digital twin modeling method based on deep learning networks is proposed to solve the above problem. The proposed method extracts sequence features of loss data using LSTM based on improved Res-LSTM network modeling, fuses all features effectively by combining residual structure with convolution kernel, and establishes a digital twin model of the UHVDC transmission system to realize strong coupling and nonlinear mapping from multiple inputs to multiple outputs. The experimental results show that the Res-LSTM model is 37.57% lower than the LSTM model for MSE in the total loss calculation mode, and 11.8% lower than the LSTM model for MSE in the sub-loss sequence calculation mode. It is verified that the Res-LSTM model has high accuracy in constructing the digital twin model to measure the total loss of the UHVDC transmission system. The proposed digital twin model can help analyze and provide some useful suggestions for loss reduction of the UHVDC transmission system.},

  abstract={In the era of big data, the field of deep learning is developing rapidly. Deep learning model algorithms and a large amount of data make deep learning an effective tool to solve practical problems. However, in the current centralized deep learning model of a large number of client-server models, when we upload our data for training on the server side, there is a risk of leaking privacy. Federated Learning is a type of distributed machine learning that allows multiple institutions or individuals to learn collaboratively without exchanging data. Users only upload their model parameters, and the server aggregates the model parameters of each user into a global model and returns it to the client, and the client updates its local model according to the global model to achieve the global optimal solution, avoiding leakage of private data. However, attackers can still restore user data by obtaining uploaded model parameters from users, which leads to the fact that only transmitting model parameters cannot protect user privacy. Therefore, the issue of privacy protection has become the focus of federated learning. In this paper, the CSP (conjugate search problem) fully homomorphic encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the user model parameters. The CSP encrypt algorithm will not cause the loss of model performance, and at the same time has the characteristics of fast encryption speed, which is very suitable for application in the field of machine learning.},

  title={Digital Twin-Driven Reinforcement Learning Method for Marine Equipment Vehicles Scheduling Problem}, 
  year={2023},

  pages={1-11},
  abstract={In the traditional marine equipment construction process, the material transportation vehicle scheduling method dominated by manual experience has shown great limitations, which is inefficient, costly, wasteful of human resources, and unable to cope with complex and changing scheduling scenarios. The existing scheduling system cannot realize the information interaction and collaborative integration between the physical world and the virtual world, while the digital twin (DT) technology can effectively solve the problem of real-time information interaction and the reinforcement learning (RL) method can cope with dynamic scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposed a DT-driven RL method to solve the marine equipment vehicle scheduling problem. Given the dynamic nature of transportation tasks, the diversity of transported goods, and the optimization characteristics of transportation requirements, a framework for scheduling transportation vehicle operations based on DT is constructed, and a RL-based vehicle scheduling method in a dynamic task environment is proposed. A Markov decision process (MDP) model of the vehicle scheduling process is established to realize one-to-one mapping between information and physical elements. An improved RL method based on Q-learning is proposed to solve the MDP model, and the value function approximation and convergence enhancement methods are applied to optimize the solving process. Finally, a case study is used for example verification to prove the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper. Note to Practitioners—The motivation of this paper is to optimize material transportation vehicle scheduling in dynamic task environments and to improve logistics transportation efficiency. Therefore, a DT-based vehicle scheduling method for marine equipment is proposed. Firstly, a framework of vehicle scheduling based on DT is designed to establish a MDP model of the vehicle scheduling process, and the dynamic task characteristics are described by mathematical methods in the design of the elements of the model. A RL-based vehicle scheduling method is proposed. The value function approximation method and the convergence enhancement method of the algorithm are investigated for the characteristics of continuous dynamic action features leading to huge state space and non-convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm performance is verified and analyzed through data validation of actual cases.},

  year={2023},
  volume={61},
  number={10},
  pages={100-106},
  abstract={Slicing-enabled communication networks refer to a network architecture that enables the definition of multiple virtual networks or “slices” over a shared physical network. Each slice operates independently with its own dedicated resources, configuration, and management. However, this poses a major challenge in guaranteeing optimal resource allocation among those slices while preserving the obligatory Quality of Service (QoS) levels for each one. This study presents a federated learning-driven digital twin (DT) framework named FED-DT for creating a digital replica of the physical slicing-supported network to mimic its complicated infrastructure and forecast the network's dynamic performance. In FED-DT, the DT of network slicing is designated as non-Euclidean graph representations. A novel lightweight Graph Lineformer Network (GLN) is introduced to collaboratively learn and estimate QoS metrics from the topological structures of the underlying network slices. The FED-DT is empowered with an intelligent self-supervision method to improve generalizability on a large network, while Gaussian Differential Privacy (DP) is applied to guarantee the preservation of model privacy during training. Proof-of-concept simulations on different network topologies demonstrate the effectiveness of FED-DT in fulfilling rigid QoS requirements and achieving ideal performance.},

  pages={3573-3590},
  abstract={Cloud computing enables Network Function Virtualization to dynamically provide and deploy network functions (NFs) to meet business-specific requirements. This approach streamlines NFs’ lifecycle management and lowers the cost of Operation Administration and Maintenance. However, these advantages cause Service Function Chain (SFC) failure to grow in both scope and dimensionality, making it difficult to establish a model to locate the failure effectively. In this paper, we propose a complete analysis scheme DTFL (Digital Twin (DT) based for SFC failure localization (FL)) through the following two steps: one is classifying and locating failures, and the other is conducting root cause analysis. We propose transGNN based on the Graph Neural Network and improved graph search model to achieve the classification and location for SFC failures. On this basis, the FNSG-RCA algorithm (failure based graph model) is proposed to analyze failures. We build a prototype based on the cloud platform and experimental results show that this scheme can achieve an accuracy rate of over 98% in fine-grained classification of 49 failure types. In addition, DTFL delivers desirable performance in RCA, approximately 13% more accurate than SOTA, the state-of-the-art approach. DTFL improves both RCA accuracy and model deployment efficiency compared with the non-DT approaches.},

  abstract={Multi-access edge computing (MEC) represents an emerging solution to improve the performance of mobile networks by bringing computing resources closer to the edge of the network. However, MEC requires the implementation of virtualization and can be deployed using different hardware platforms, including COTS devices. In this highly heterogeneous scenario, the digital twin (DT), assisted by proper AI/ML solutions, is envisioned to play a crucial role in automated network management, operating as an intermediate and collaborative layer enabling the orchestration layer to better understand network behavior before making changes to the physical network. In this paper, we aim to develop a DT model that captures the behavior of a MEC node supporting services with varying workloads. In pursuit of this objective, we adopt a data-driven methodology that effectively learn a model predicting three critical key performance indicators (KPIs): throughput, computational load, and power consumption. To demonstrate the viability and potential of such approach, a measurement campaign is conducted on MEC nodes deployed with different virtualization environments (bare metal, virtual machine, and containerized), and the results are used to build the DT of each node. Furthermore, machine learning models, including k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), and polynomial fitting (PF), are used to understand the amount of actual measurements required to achieve a suitably low KPI prediction error. The results of this study provide a basis for further research in the field of MEC DT models and carbon footprint-aware orchestration.},

  abstract={The telecommunications sector is devoting an initial interest in the representation of complex networks as Digital Twins. The concept of a Digital Twin Network (DTN) is a research topic, but it promises to be an important step for harmonizing different models of the Edge-Cloud Continuum. The DTN software framework aims at helping network operations by providing updated and complete views on the network or parts of it, and it also introduces the possibility to simulate the network behavior or to learn from network events history (Machine Learning) without jeopardizing the actual operations of resources. In addition, thanks to the representation capabilities of the DT, its usage in the network promises to support different stakeholders’ views on their virtualized and physical infrastructure. This work tries to consolidate a DTN data model representing the elements of the Edge-Cloud Continuum by providing a layered (horizontal) and segmented (vertical) view of the infrastructure to all the involved stakeholders. The DTN model is an ontology where the linked classes represent properties and relations of networked components. This work aims to design a flexible and extensible ontology that describes the Edge-Cloud continuum usable in the telecommunications as well in the Cloud (IT and web) industries creating a bridge between the two.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) is a prominent technology to utilise and deploy within the healthcare sector.

In this paper, we address all the challenges by provisioning adaptive Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) to enforce security policies associated with different data-sharing scenarios. We define a Cloud-Native Network orchestrator on top of a multi-node cluster mesh infrastructure for flexible and dynamic container scheduling. The proposed framework considers the intended data-sharing use case, the policies associated, and infrastructure configurations, then provisions Service Function Chaining (SFC) and provides routing configurations accordingly with little to no human intervention. As a result, we provide an adaptive network orchestration for digital health twin use cases, that is policy-aware, requirements-aware, and resource-aware.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-15},
  abstract={As the cornerstone of human-behavior analysis in video understanding, temporal action proposal generation aims to predict the starting and ending time of human action instances in untrimmed videos. Although large achievements in temporal action proposal generation have been achieved, most previous studies ignore the variability of action frequency in raw videos, leading to unsatisfying performances on high-action-frequency videos. In fact, there exists two main issues which should be well addressed: data imbalance between high and low action-frequency videos, and inferior detection of short actions in high-action-frequency videos. To address the above issues, we propose an effective framework by adapting to the variability of action frequency, namely Action Frequency Adaptive Network (AFAN), which can be flexibly built upon any temporal action proposal generation method. AFAN consists of two modules: Learning From Experts (LFE) and Fine-Grained Processing (FGP). The LFE first trains a series of action proposal generators on different subsets of imbalanced data as experts and then teaches a unified student model via knowledge distillation. To better detect short actions, FGP first finds out high-action-frequency videos and then performs fine-grained detection. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets (ActivityNet-1.3, HACS, THUMOS14 and FineAction) demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed AFAN, especially for high-action-frequency videos.},

  abstract={In the metaverse, the concept of the digital twin has been expanded from modeling industrial manufacturing to the counterpart of physical objects in cyberspace.

Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides computing resources for mobile devices to handle complex tasks, addressing the shortcomings of mobile devices in performance. Cyber digital twins with artificial intelligence (AI) capability have great advantages in addressing complex and changing environments. In this article, we propose a cyber digital twin-based mobile edge computing framework, which integrates artificial intelligence into mobile edge networks to enable intelligent resource management. We address the edge computation offloading task through formulating an optimization problem that minimizes the latency of a mobile user via MEC server selection and power allocation. Our solution employs a reinforcement learning-based algorithm, which we demonstrate to be effective. The experimental results show that the cyber digital twin based framework with artificial intelligence capability can further reduce task processing latency and improve the quality of service provided to users.},

  abstract={In the context of label-efficient learning on video data, the distillation method and the structural design of the teacher-student architecture have a significant impact on knowledge distillation. However, the relationship between these factors has been overlooked in previous research. To address this gap, we propose a new weakly supervised learning framework for knowledge distillation in video classification that is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the student model. Our approach leverages the concept of substage-based learning to distill knowledge based on the combination of student substages and the correlation of corresponding substages. We also employ the progressive cascade training method to address the accuracy loss caused by the large capacity gap between the teacher and the student. Additionally, we propose a pseudo-label optimization strategy to improve the initial data label. To optimize the loss functions of different distillation substages during the training process, we introduce a new loss method based on feature distribution. We conduct extensive experiments on both real and simulated data sets, demonstrating that our proposed approach outperforms existing distillation methods in terms of knowledge distillation for video classification tasks. Our proposed substage-based distillation approach has the potential to inform future research on label-efficient learning for video data.},

  abstract={Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have been developed to enhance driving safety by issuing timely warnings to drivers. However, current ADAS do not take into account the driver's cognitive state when delivering warnings, which can result in false alarms and impact the driver's trust in the system. To address this issue, we propose a Cognitive-digital-twin-based Driving Assistance System (CDAS) that issues warnings tailored to the driver's perception of the driving environment and driving style. In this letter, we present a model of the driver's decision-making process that explicitly captures their perception of the driving environment, their utility evaluation of predicted future environments, and their driving style in terms of minimum acceptable risk. The cognitive digital twin of the driver is then created and updated by minimizing the discrepancy between the predicted and actual behaviors of the driver. With the cognitive digital twin, the CDAS warns the driver when there is a significant discrepancy between the predicted driving strategy based on partial observation and that based on full observation. This approach can more accurately identify risks that the driver is not aware of and provide warnings only when necessary. We conducted human and simulated experiments in a virtual driving environment, and our results demonstrate that our proposed CDAS has a similar perception of risky behaviors compared to humans. Furthermore, the digital twin learning framework can identify the driving styles of human participants and accurately predict their driving strategies. Additionally, our proposed cognitive driving assistance system provides fewer false warnings and avoids more collisions compared to state-of-the-art ADAS algorithms. Our research shows that incorporating the driver's cognitive state and driving style can enhance the effectiveness and safety of driving assistance systems.},

  pages={2629-2642},
  abstract={The goal of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is to determine the sentiment polarity towards an aspect. Because of the expensive and limited amounts of labelled data, the pretraining strategy has become the de facto standard for ABSA. However, there always exists a severe domain shift between the pretraining and downstream ABSA datasets, which hinders effective knowledge transfer when directly fine-tuning, making the downstream task suboptimal. To mitigate this domain shift, we introduce a unified alignment pretraining framework into the vanilla pretrain-finetune pipeline, that has both instance- and knowledge-level alignments. Specifically, we first devise a novel coarse-to-fine retrieval sampling approach to select target domain-related instances from the large-scale pretraining dataset, thus aligning the instances between pretraining and the target domains (First Stage). Then, we introduce a knowledge guidance-based strategy to further bridge the domain gap at the knowledge level. In practice, we formulate the model pretrained on the sampled instances into a knowledge guidance model and a learner model. On the target dataset, we design an on-the-fly teacher-student joint fine-tuning approach to progressively transfer the knowledge from the knowledge guidance model to the learner model (Second Stage). Therefore, the learner model can maintain more domain-invariant knowledge when learning new knowledge from the target dataset. In the Third Stage, the learner model is finetuned to better adapt its learned knowledge to the target dataset. Extensive experiments and analyses on several ABSA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposed pretraining framework.},

  abstract={With the development of deep learning and advances in the hardware industry, deep neural network with large amounts of parameters has ushered in better and more accurate prediction results, but also increases GPU resource costs. In this way, the deployment of models in terminals become a new problem, deduction time also costs a lot. To address these issues, we propose a model-assisted approach on feature-based knowledge distillation by introducing an auxiliary model together with the teacher model to guide the learning of the student model. We use auxiliary model to reducing the gap caused by structural and scale differences between the teacher model and the student model. The result shows that the prediction accuracy improved significantly also maintain a good generation ability. The choice of student models still remains problem in the field of knowledge distillation still, and the differences in the structure of the teacher model student models are still the important factors affecting the results of knowledge distillation. Therefore, this paper focuses on the accuracy and generation ability of student model on the distillation results, based on which a model-assisted boosting method is proposed, in which the knowledge are migrated to the student model by the teacher model together with the auxiliary model.},

  abstract={Identifying the locations of cyber attacks in power distribution systems is critical to take immediate and effective mitigation actions. This article introduces a novel real-time attack localization strategy for power distribution systems utilizing a Digital Twin (DT) as a cyber-physical real-time reference model that mimics the cyber-physical dynamic characteristics of the actual system. The proposed approach takes advantage of the DT-based reference model as well as the physical characteristics of the radial distribution network to compute a new metric, namely Residual Rate of Change (RRC), which allows differentiating False Data Injection (FDI) attacks on load measurements and protective devices. The RRC enables the determination of the attack's location by constructing a directed graph that characterizes the physical dependencies of protective devices. The proposed attack localization method is implemented on a testbed consisting of a digital real-time simulator, feeder protection devices, a real-time automation controller, and advanced communication infrastructure for a power distribution system. The provided experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method to localize cyber attacks in various operation scenarios of the power distribution system.

  abstract={In the age of digitalization, virtually everything around us is on the cloud. The metaverse allows people to perform the things they do in the real and virtual worlds. In the virtual world of the metaverse, everything from work to communication is on demand and connected. One of the advantages of the metaverse is the lack of physical barriers in development. Performing tests on expensive equipment are no longer expensive because companies do not have to purchase physical hardware. In addition, the risks in performing tests are virtually eliminated. Hardware errors may cause damage to a physical system, but in a metaverse, all one needs to do is reboot the virtual machine and have it reloaded with an operating system. In additive manufacturing, testing a 3D printer may take time and resources. Furthermore, miscalculations and unfavorable environmental conditions may lead to printing issues. Developing a simulation tool to test a 3D printer in variable environments is explored to address possible problems with additive manufacturing. The behavior of the digital twin will be diagnosed using various deep learning algorithms implemented in various studies. CNN-BiLSTM has proven to be the most accurate of the deep learning algorithms explored.},

  abstract={This study presents a data-driven dynamics and robust control framework, referred to as UAMDynCon-DT, for the accurate cloning of ground-truth dynamics and the robust control of attitude in a personal aerial vehicle (PAV) known as the KP-1 eVTOL aircraft. The proposed framework utilizes exponentially stabilizing control Lyapunov functions to ensure stability and robustness, and utilizes a nonlinear flight dynamics model of the KP-1 to construct the controller. To evaluate its performance, real-world flight tests were conducted on a scaled model of the KP-1, and results were compared to those obtained from traditional control methods. The tests demonstrated improved resilience to disturbances and uncertainties when utilizing the proposed framework. This research suggests that UAMDynConDT could be a valuable tool for the future development of large-scale urban air mobility vehicles.},

  abstract={The efficiency, return on investment, and output of Solar power plants are all significantly impacted by the development of Digital Twin technology. Digital Twining of the Solar PV system will help to improve the predictability of the power output, gather the necessary information for energy forecasting (predict ahead the power output to balance supply and demand) and power system default detection. The main objective of this study is to develop a Digital Twin Solar PV system. The technical approach used to develop a Solar PV Digital Twin includes: (1) real time data collection of power output from Solar PV system using smart sensors, (2) development, calibration, and validation of a Solar PV system model using MATLAB (3) development and testing the accuracy of LSTM-based forecasting model to predict ahead (15 mins) the Solar PV electrical power output using historical data. The results show that the Solar PV Digital Twin compares well with the targeted data from the real system (data from sensors of the physical Solar PV system). The accuracy of the models was assessed using the coefficient of correlation (R). The results show that the Solar PV Digital Twin simulation and forecasting models have R-values of 0.99893 and 0.99427, respectively. To help an asset owner or operator to visualize the performance of Digital Twin, a dashboard application was developed using MATLAB App Designer. The dashboard shows current, historical, and continuously forecasts future energy consumption and production to balance supply and demand. The development of Digital Twin technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning predictive tools for monitoring, forecasting and maintenance of Solar PV plants are keys to reach the Net Zero Energy Building goals. Additionally, to ensure the reproducibility of the research, the irradiance measurements data was published in a GitHub repository.},

  abstract={Federated learning (FL) allows for the decentralized training of a global model on edge devices without transferring data samples, thus preserving privacy. Due to the ubiquitous wearable devices and mobile devices with health applications, FL has shown promise in the medical field for applications such as medical imaging, disease diagnosis, and electronic health record (EHR) analysis. However, slower edge devices with limited resources can slow down the training process. To address this issue and increase efficiency, we propose the use of Asynchronous Federated Learning with Knowledge Distillation (AsyncFedKD). AsyncFedKD asynchronously trains a lightweight global student model using a pre-trained teacher model, preventing a decrease in training efficiency due to slow edge devices. The knowledge distillation aspect of AsyncFedKD effectively compresses the size of model parameters for efficient communication during training. AsyncFedKD has been tested on a sensitive mammography cancer dataset and achieved an accuracy of 88% on the global model.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in applying electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in lung monitoring due to its advantages of being noninvasive, nonionizing, real time, and functional imaging with no harmful side effects. However, the EIT images reconstructed by traditional algorithms suffer from low spatial resolution. This article proposes a novel EIT-based lung monitoring scheme by using a 3-D digital twin lung model and a deep learning-based image reconstruction algorithm. Unlike the static numerical or experimental simulations used in other data-driven EIT imaging methods, our digital twin lung model incorporates the biomechanical and electrical properties of the lung to generate a more realistic and dynamic dataset. Additionally, the image reconstruction network (IR-Net) is used to learn the prior information in the dataset and accurately reconstruct the conductivity variation within the lungs during respiration. The results indicate that EIT using a guided digital twin and deep learning-based image reconstruction has better accuracy and anti-noise performance compared to traditional EIT. The proposed EIT imaging framework provides a new idea for efficiently creating labeled EIT data and has potential to be used in various data-driven methods for electrical biomedical imaging.},

We first formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the beampattern performance of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radars and the computation offloading energy consumption simultaneously. Then, we explore the prediction capability of DT to provide intelligent offloading decision, where the DT estimation deviation is considered. To track this challenge, we reformulate the original problem as a multi-agent Markov decision process and design a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) framework to achieve a flexible learning policy. Furthermore, the Beta-policy and attention mechanism are used to improve the training performance. Numerical results show that the proposed method is able to balance the performance tradeoff between sensing and computation functions, while reducing the energy consumption compared with the existing studies.},

  abstract={Recent research has demonstrated that the heat induced by high data rate transmission could cause low-temperature burns. As a promising application for future wireless networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is capable of providing high data rate transmission for ground users. Inspired by this progress, this article focuses on the resource allocation for the UAV scenario and proposes a novel framework to consider the newly mentioned phenomenon named by power-consumption outage (PCO). Specifically, we give the analysis of heat transfer model in the smartphone based on which we initially integrate the influence of PCO into the optimization problem of the UAV scenario. Furthermore, to solve the problem with joint optimization of bandwidth allocation and trajectory design, we propose a machine learning model consisting of the position prediction based on echo state network and the joint optimization based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Due to the continuity in action space, DRL optimization is specifically implemented by the normalized advantage function algorithm. Besides, considering the restriction for the implementation of machine learning, we propose a digital twin-enabled architecture to provide a virtual environment for the training. Simulation results show the advantage of the proposed scheme in total throughput and the adaptability for trajectory design in the presence of PCO.},

  volume={9},
  number={6},
  pages={1707-1720},
  abstract={Traditional centralized machine learning uses a large amount of data for model training, which may face some privacy and security problems. On the other hand, federated learning (FL), which focuses on privacy protection, also faces challenges such as core network congestion and limited mobile device (MD) resources. The computation offloading technology of mobile edge computing (MEC) can effectively alleviate these challenges, but it ignores the effect of user mobility and the unpredictable MEC environment. In this paper, we first propose an architecture that combines digital twin (DT) and MEC technologies with the FL framework, where the DT network can virtually imitate the statue of physical entities (PEs) and network topology to be used for real-time data analysis and network resource optimization. The computation offloading technology of MEC is used to alleviate resource constraints of MDs and the core network congestion. We further leverage the FL to construct DT models based on PEs’ running data. Then, we jointly optimize the problem of computation offloading and resource allocation to reduce the straggler effect in FL based on the framework. Since the solution of the objective function is a stochastic programming problem, we model a Markov decision process (MDP), and use the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to solve this objective function. The simulation results prove the feasibility of the proposed scheme, and the scheme can significantly reduce the total cost by about 50% and improve the communication performance compared with baseline schemes.},

  abstract={The fault diagnosis of rolling bearings is of utmost importance in industrial applications to ensure mechanical systems' reliability, safety, and economic viability. However, conventional data-driven fault diagnosis techniques mainly depend on a pre-existing dataset with complete failure modes and knowledge to serve as the training data, which may not be available or accessible in some crucial industrial scenarios. This can limit the practicality of these methodologies in real-world industrial applications. This article addresses this issue by developing a novel digital twin-enabled domain adversarial graph network (DT-DAGN). The main contributions of this article are as follows: 1) the development of a comprehensive and accurate digital twin model for rolling bearings that includes a dynamic simulation of the bearing's operational status using only its structural parameters and failure severity/size to obtain the system's vibration response, and 2) the development of a novel graph convolutional network-based transfer learning framework to transfer knowledge from simulated datasets to measured datasets, enabling effective fault diagnostics of bearings with limited knowledge. A series of experiments are applied to validate the efficacy of the developed methodology.},

Leveraging unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms, namely BiDirectional Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN), affinity propagation and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), we semantically model the complex distributions of ITS data streams and perform anomaly detection utilizing graph representations. Employing DT applications and diverse sensory measurements from the BeIntelli smart mobility platform of TU Berlin, we compare the performance of our approach with traditional and deep learning based methods in terms of detection accuracy and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC).

These predictions are then used by a Predictive Block Assignment module to maximize the BEB fleet utilization. This module computes the optimal BEB daily assignment and charge management strategy. A Depot Parking and Charging Queue Management module is used to autonomously park and charge the vehicles based on their charging demands. The paper discusses the technical approach and benefits of each level in the architecture and concludes with a realistic simulations study.

  abstract={Cooperation of automated vehicles (AVs) can improve safety, efficiency and comfort in traffic. Digital twins of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) play an important role in monitoring, managing and improving traffic. Computing a live digital twin of traffic requires as input live perception data of preferably multiple connected entities such as automated vehicles (AVs). One such type of perception data are evidential occupancy grid maps (OGMs). The computation of a digital twin involves their spatiotemporal alignment and fusion. In this work, we focus on the spatial alignment, also known as registration, and fusion of evidential occupancy grid maps of multiple automated vehicles. While there exists extensive research on the synchronization and fusion of object-based environment representations, the registration and fusion of OGMs originating from multiple connected vehicles has not been investigated much. We propose a methodology that involves training a deep neural network (DNN) to predict a fused evidential OGM from two OGMs computed by different AVs. The output includes an estimate of the first- and second-order uncertainty. We demonstrate that the DNN trained with synthetic data only outperforms a baseline approach based on coordinate transformation and combination rules also on real-world data. Experimental results on synthetic data show that our approach is able to compensate for spatial misalignments of up to 5 meters and 20 degrees.},

  abstract={Digital Twinning of physical world scenes onto the Metaverse is necessary for augmented reality (AR)-assisted driving. In AR-assisted driving, physical environment scenes are first captured by AR vehicles and are uploaded to the Metaverse for the construction of the Metaverse Map. However, the development of AR-assisted driving applications invites adversaries. These attackers may place adversarial patches on physical objects, seeking to contort the Metaverse Map. As real-time, accurate detection of adversarial patches is compute-intensive, these physical world scenes have to be offloaded to the Metaverse Map Base Station (MMBS) for computation. Therefore, we considered a scenario where AR vehicles capture physical world scenes and upload these scenes in real-time to the MMBSs. We formulated an optimization problem where the MMSP’s objective is to maximize adversarial patch detection mean Average Precision (mAP), while minimizing the computed AR scene uplink transmission latency and minimizing the worst-case (largest) AR vehicle’s uplink transmission battery charge consumption, through optimizing the AR vehicle-MMBS allocation, AR vehicle uplink scene resolution selection, and AR vehicle uplink power output selection. We proposed a Heterogeneous Action (HA) algorithm to tackle the proposed problem. Extensive experiments show our HA models outperforms baseline models when compared against key metrics.},

  pages={1-13},
  abstract={At present, the method based on deep learning performs well in public object detection tasks. However, there are still two problems to be solved for industrial defect detection: 1) industrial scenes require real-time and lightweight and 2) lightweight network (LightNet) accuracy is limited. In order to tackle these issues, based on knowledge distillation (KL), this article proposes an effective lightweight defect detection network (KD-LightNet) suitable for edge scenes. First of all, a LightNet is designed based on structure reparameterization, which can sufficiently improve the capability of network feature extraction and reduce the complexity of model inferring. Moreover, a well-prepared self-distillation strategy is proposed, which utilizes the pretrained LightNet network as a teacher model to transfer knowledge in the same structure. Then, in order to fully utilize the logits predicted by the teacher model, an improved KL divergence loss is proposed to enhance the accuracy of the student model. Finally, in the experiments, three industrial datasets (PKU-Market-PCB, NEU-DET, and Magnetic tile defect dataset) were used to validate the proposed model performance. The KD-LightNet detection accuracy (mAP) is improved by an average of 6.87%, while the average detection speed reaches 72 frames/s at 3070Ti (Params 4.7 M), which meets the requirements of industrial defect detection accuracy and real-time.},

  year={2023},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Smart solutions increasingly involve the use of sensor data to represent the physical world in the digital world and apply intelligence to such representation. The main approach is a vertical end-to-end solution from sensors to intelligence and back to actuators. Recently, a new holistic approach, the so-called Digital Twin, has emerged. This goes beyond traditional smart solutions by replicating, with high fidelity cross-domain aspects, a physical object into the digital world. The key differentiation is the inclusion of semantics information in the digital replica in a form of knowledge graph. Further, analytics continuously enrich Digital Twin’s information with predictions and insights. In this article, we adopt the Digital Twin approach for the creation of a digital replica of Espinardo’s campus at the University of Murcia (Spain). The starting point is the existing sensor network deployment and the infrastructure under development of Fog-Edge-Cloud computing based on a 5G private network. The smart campus Digital Twin is formed by the Digital Twins of 23 buildings for which different sets of data features have been thoroughly selected. We implement the concept of Digital Twin by merging sensor data with external open data sources, analytics models implemented and information processed by these analytics. We report our experience showing the issues encountered handling the data and producing various analytics models for predicting energy consumption, building occupancy, room usage, solar energy, and anomaly detection. From our experience, we highlight some lessons learned and directions towards the full operational smart campus Digital Twin.},

  title={Structured Knowledge Distillation for Accurate and Efficient Object Detection}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={45},
  number={12},
  pages={15706-15724},
  abstract={Knowledge distillation, which aims to transfer the knowledge learned by a cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight student model, has become one of the most popular and effective techniques in computer vision. However, many previous knowledge distillation methods are designed for image classification and fail in more challenging tasks such as object detection. In this paper, we first suggest that the failure of knowledge distillation on object detection is mainly caused by two reasons: (1) the imbalance between pixels of foreground and background and (2) lack of knowledge distillation on the relation among different pixels. Then, we propose a structured knowledge distillation scheme, including attention-guided distillation and non-local distillation to address the two issues, respectively. Attention-guided distillation is proposed to find the crucial pixels of foreground objects with an attention mechanism and then make the students take more effort to learn their features. Non-local distillation is proposed to enable students to learn not only the feature of an individual pixel but also the relation between different pixels captured by non-local modules. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method on thirteen kinds of object detection models with twelve comparison methods for both object detection and instance segmentation. For instance, Faster RCNN with our distillation achieves 43.9 mAP on MS COCO2017, which is 4.1 higher than the baseline. Additionally, we show that our method is also beneficial to the robustness and domain generalization ability of detectors. Codes and model weights have been released on GitHub1.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={236-241},
  abstract={This paper considers a use case of flying base station placement enabled by digital twin (DT), and demonstrates how DT can help reduce the impact of a non-stationary environment on reinforcement learning (RL). RL is able to learn the optimal policy via interacting with a specific environment. However, it has been observed that RL is very sensitive to environment change, mainly because the environment variation disturbs RL training/learning. A possible approach is to execute the RL process in the DT using snapshots of the environment (parameters), and update the parameters at a proper frequency. The DT-RL bundled approach takes advantage of computing resources in the DT, speeds up the process and saves battery energy of the flying base station, and more importantly, mitigates the nonstationary impact on RL. Specifically, the use case is about quickly connecting mobile users with an aerial bass station. The base station is autonomously and optimally placed according to a predefined criterion to connect scattered slow-movement users. Q-learning, a common type of RL, is employed as a solution to the optimization of base station placement. Tailored for this application, a two-stage base station placement algorithm is proposed and evaluated. For the configuration considered in this paper, numerical results suggest that 1) the Q-learning algorithm run solely in the physical space does not work due to intolerable time consuming and optimization divergence, and 2) the proposed scheme can catch up with random slow movement of mobile users, and tolerate certain measurement and model errors. With necessary modification and extension, the proposed framework could be applied to other DT-assisted cyber-physical systems.},

  abstract={Comparatively to other fields, the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based medical decisions remains limited. In general, AI-based medical decisions necessitate modeling the conditions being treated, including potential treatment alternatives and trajectories. Due to the heterogeneity of most medical conditions, developing these models requires a vast quantity of data. Although current healthcare systems generate abundant digital data, this data is frequently fragmented, stored in multiple locations, organized according to various structures, and lacks context, posing a challenge for integrating and utilizing these data to model the relevant conditions. Effective AI medical solutions, we argue, necessitate the development of an AI-specific medical vocabulary, which we call information tokens. The proposed vocabulary would enable AI methods to access diverse medical records and provide the context for developing treatment models, instead of only conditions-specific models. Then, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based agent, the human digital twin, which models medical conditions and provides patient-specific treatment recommendations based on the condition vocabulary. Finally, we define a framework for managing and coordinating the utilization and update of the vocabulary, and the treatment models throughout a healthcare system.},

  abstract={AI-based digital twins are at the leading edge of the Industry 4.0 revolution, which are technologically empowered by the Internet of Things and real-time data analysis. Information collected from industrial assets is produced in a continuous fashion, yielding data streams that must be processed under stringent timing constraints. Such data streams are usually subject to non-stationary phenomena, causing that the data distribution of the streams may change, and thus the knowledge captured by models used for data analysis may become obsolete (leading to the so-called concept drift effect). The early detection of the change (drift) is crucial for updating the model’s knowledge, which is challenging especially in scenarios where the ground truth associated to the stream data is not readily available. Among many other techniques, the estimation of the model’s confidence has been timidly suggested in a few studies as a criterion for detecting drifts in unsupervised settings. The goal of this manuscript is to confirm and expose solidly the connection between the model’s confidence in its output and the presence of a concept drift, showcasing it experimentally and advocating for a major consideration of uncertainty estimation in comparative studies to be reported in the future.},

  abstract={In this study, we propose a novel sensor and data-driven marketability model to accompany the digital twin of a strawberry based on the environmental conditions encountered throughout the storage and transportation of commercial perishable goods. Postharvest, the quality of strawberries deteriorates and an accurate representation of the marketability of the digital twin becomes crucial. However, a true data driven model is difficult to build due to lack of sufficient data which can be collected during transportation. With the help of trained food and postharvest scientists, marketability data was collected on a large volume of strawberries exposed to different temperature treatments in environmental chambers. Later, machine learning was used to learn the correlation between the marketability of strawberries and the typical temperatures they are exposed to during transportation. We demonstrated that the proposed data-driven algorithm can achieve a similar marketability assessment as the trained experts in the field with an error percentage as low 4.21% using support vector regression which can enable smart distribution such as First-Expired-First-Out.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation aims to enhance the performance of a lightweight student model by exploiting the knowledge from a pre-trained cumbersome teacher model. However, in the traditional knowledge distillation, teacher predictions are only used to provide the supervisory signal for the last layer of the student model, which may result in those shallow student layers lacking accurate training guidance in the layer-by-layer back propagation and thus hinders effective knowledge transfer. To address this issue, we propose Deeply-Supervised Knowledge Distillation (DSKD), which fully utilizes class predictions and feature maps of the teacher model to supervise the training of shallow student layers. A loss-based weight allocation strategy is developed in DSKD to adaptively balance the learning process of each shallow layer, so as to further improve the student performance. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet with various teacher-student models show significantly performance, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed method.

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is gradually becoming more prevalent through numerous devices and technologies, including sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, cloud-enabled services, and analytics. IoT objects gain intelligence by integrating with wireless sensor networks (WSNs), mobile computing and communication, and others. With sensors, smart things can be enabled by monitoring and identifying environmental changes related to motion, temperature, humidity, pressure, light, vibration, etc. To timely keep track of state changes, researchers are considering developing a cyber replicator, denoted as Digital Twin (DT), of real physical systems as a way to visualize, model, and work with complex cyber-physical systems (CPS). In this paper, we first refine the dataset to a format that can be easily used for deep learning (DL) experiments, IoT data pipeline development, data modeling and simulation, data aggregation, etc. We then demonstrate that DT data can be used to determine space occupancy based on the ambient light sensor, which tends to indicate occupancy in particular spaces because the building has smart lighting that will switch off when rooms are unoccupied after a certain time. Given the apparent developments in machine learning technology, it is clear that machine learning-based prediction has the ability to enhance resource utilization and further forecast future events. Particularly, we use a DT-based dataset and Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture to forecast the campus building’s internal temperature.},

  abstract={The Advanced and radical development of IT technology and artificial intelligence technology have made it possible to develop advanced services Digital Twin, Metaverse, Metatwin-verse, etc using Artificial Intelligence(AI). The results induced from AI present the correct solution when AI performs accurate study and analysis. Specifically, real situations reflecting complex relationships between objects, results from real situations have to be adaptive to convergence situations and then it should be possible to draw conclusions and make decisions that are not limited to specific situations. So, it is essential to conduct AI based study and analysis by considering these real world characteristics to provide digital twin services based on metaverse. Recently, there are many studies on Graph Neural Network(GNN) and services applied to GNN for learning the relationship between objects detected in real situations. Accordingly, this paper proposes a metaverse-based Digital Twin Convergence Service(DTCS) including spatial elements strategy that is possible to draw accurate conclusions in a changing convergence situation. DTCS is able to conduct causal reasoning and association learning between objects considering directions and distances change characteristics between objects and this is possible to make correct solution and decision making in the process of simulation and analysis of digital twin. In that DTCS proceeds by considering distance and changing angle between objects, this overcomes the limitation of existing GNN which only considers the degree of association or assigns the same parameters to connected objects. DTCS would be possible to expand the advanced services of Metatwinverse in that it is possible to have robust learning based conclusions in real-time changing convergence situations.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect novel objects with limited annotated examples. Mainstream methods suffer from the data scarcity of novel classes with insufficient intra-class variations, which makes the trained model biased to base classes. Actually, there are massive unlabeled novel instances in the base dataset and their adequate utilization will enhance the discriminability of model to novel classes. This paper proposes a semi-supervised few-shot object detection method, which utilizes a teacher model and a pre-trained few-shot object detector to guide the learning of a student model through adaptive pseudo labeling. In particular, a class-adaptive threshold filtering (CATF) strategy is designed to deal with the class-imbalance problem of pseudo labels. And for each novel class, the threshold to select valuable pseudo labels is determined by quantile statistics of the confidence score distribution of pseudo labels. Furthermore, the pre-trained detector and the teacher model are associated with the preliminary CATF and in-depth CATF, respectively, and then the pseudo labels from the two-stream CATF are fused to provide supervisions. In this way, the knowledge of these two models is exploited, which improves the quality of pseudo labels. Under these supervisions, the student model is trained and the teacher model is correspondingly updated through parameters sharing, thus forming a positive feedback to improve the performance of both models. Besides, an attention module is integrated to the teacher and student models to enhance the feature representation of novel instances. The validations on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  pages={1247-1251},
  abstract={In recent years, multi-view clustering has gained widespread attention in signal processing because multi-view data contains more information than a single view. However, multi-view data is often incomplete due to missing data in one or more random views. Therefore, several methods have been proposed for incomplete multi-view clustering to learn features that contain consensus information for clustering incomplete multi-view data (IMD). However, there is a part of the IMD that is not missing in any view, and most previous methods have not utilized this part to guide the process of learning consensus information. To address this issue, we design a knowledge distillation framework for incomplete multi-view clustering and propose an incomplete multi-view clustering with complete view guidance (IMC-CVG). We first train a robust teacher model with contrastive learning loss on the complete part of IMD to learn consensus features containing multi-view information. Then, we train a student model on all the IMD, where we mask partial views of the complete data to simulate missing data, and utilize the teacher model to guide the student model to learn consensus features that contain as much multi-view information as possible. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms all the compared state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Tunnel building is a hazardous working environment, where operators mainly deal with two processes: tunnel excavation and ring building. Ring building is a crucial task involving the assembly of concrete segments into a tunnel ring using an erector unit to reinforce the freshly bored tunnel surface. The erector unit is a human-controlled robot with six degrees of freedom movement used to grab and place the individual tunnel segments. The experience of the erector operator is hence decisive for an efficient ring building process, which can be optimized with the assistance of intelligent control systems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a learning approach that provided many control policies for robotic applications. Currently, no simulation environment is publicly available to train and test RL agents on erector units in tunnel ring building. This research aims to address this gap by designing an Experimental Digital Twin (EDT) for the erector unit in ring building. We created our EDT using the simulation tool MuJoCo and Proximal Policy Optimization as RL method. Our findings reveal that the RL agent learned to successfully build tunnel rings with a control policy that can be further optimized for fine adjustments in segment placing, especially the last ring segment. Our future work consists of investigating the RL agent robustness and studying transfer potential to real-world applications under safety constraints. Our EDT is a first step towards learning control policies that optimally execute segment lining, thus helping human operators build tunnel rings efficiently in a challenging work environment prone to accidents and decreasing interest from future talents.},

  abstract={Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging analysis has been a useful tool in screening patients for heart disease. Early, timely and accurate diagnosis of diseases of the heart series is the key to effective treatment. MRI provides important material for the diagnosis of cardiac diseases. The rise of deep learning has transformed computer-aided diagnostic systems, especially in the field of medical imaging. Existing work on cardiac structure segmentation models based on MRI imaging mainly relies on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which lack model diversity and limit the prediction performance. This paper introduces Visual Transformer with Feature Recombination and Feature Distillation(ViT-FRD), a novel learning pipeline that combines a visual transformer (ViT) and a CNN through knowledge refinement. The training procedure allows the student model, i.e., ViT, to learn from the teacher model, i.e., CNN, by optimizing distillation losses. Meanwhile, ViT-FRD provides two performance boosters to increase the efficacy and efficiency of training. The proposed method is validated on two cardiac MRI image datasets. The findings demonstrate that ViT-FRD achieves SOTA and outperforms the widely used baseline model.},

  abstract={The implementation of next generation beyond 5G use cases such as the Digital Twin (DT) requires the transportation of increasingly large amounts of sensor telemetry data. The reduction of the size of these time series shaped data through compression has many benefits, ranging from energy savings in systems where sensors have limited power to transport network bandwidth reduction. Both statistical analysis-based and machine learning (ML)-based approaches have been employed to tackle this task with varying degrees of success. In this paper, we compare two methods for time series data compression: a statistical similarity-based one, and an autoencoder (AE)-based one.},

  abstract={Smart healthcare aims to revolutionize med-ical services by integrating artificial intelligence (AI). The limitations of classical machine learning include privacy concerns that prevent direct data sharing among medical institutions, untimely updates, and long training times. To address these issues, this study proposes a digital twin-assisted quantum federated learning algorithm (DTQFL). By leveraging the 5G mobile network, digital twins (DT) of patients can be created instantly using data from various Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices and simultane-ously reduce communication time in federated learning (FL) at the same time. DTQFL generates DT for patients with specific diseases, allowing for synchronous training and updating of the variational quantum neural network (VQNN) without disrupting the VQNN in the real world. This study utilized DTQFL to train its own personalized VQNN for each hospital, considering privacy security and training speed. Simultaneously, the personalized VQNN of each hospital was obtained through further local iterations of the final global parameters. The results indicate that DTQFL can train a good VQNN without collecting local data while achieving accuracy comparable to that of data-centralized algorithms. In addition, after personalized train-ing, the VQNN can achieve higher accuracy than that with-out personalized training.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging paradigm that enables a virtual model to effectively represent a physical process. In this paper, we present the adoption of the DT scheme by an offset printing company towards industrial optimization. The considered DT model is a virtual representation that serves as the digital copy of the physical printing process within an industrial unit. A virtual model for selecting the optimal machine line was developed to ensure cost-efficient printing. The machine line selection process was modeled as a decision process and then analyzed through simulations in a safe and cost-efficient digital environment, provided by the DT. Moreover, Machine Learning (ML) models were exploited to extract knowledge for the machine selection task, taking full advantage of the DT experiment. Based on real data and selection policies of a printing enterprise, the results revealed an improvement during the selection process, followed by a 5% cost reduction on the examined dataset.},

  abstract={As the digital replica of a physical system (PS), a digital twin (DT) is responsible for providing real-time information of its PS to applications. However, random network conditions result in uncertainty in future age of information (AoI) at the DT, which makes it complicated for a DT to decide when to response an application request in order to maintain the best information freshness at the application. In this work, we consider the effect of random wireless channel condition between the PS and the DT on the AoI changes at the DT, and formulate a Markov decision process that finds the optimum response time for the DT to send the PS information to an application after receiving a request from the application. The objective is to minimize the average AoI at the application. The MDP has delayed reward, and is solved by redistributing the reward with LSTM network and then finding the optimal policies using Dueling Double Deep Q-learning. Numerical results show that the solutions provide close-to-optimum average AoI performance.},

  abstract={In a photovoltaic power plant (PVPP), the DC-AC converter (inverter) is one of the components most prone to faults. Even though they are key equipment in such installations, their fault detection techniques are not as much explored as PV module-related issues, for instance. In that sense, this paper is motivated to find novel tools for detection focused on the inverter, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms trained using a hybrid dataset. The hybrid dataset is composed of real and synthetic data for fault-free and faulty conditions. A dataset is built based on fault-free data from the PVPP and faulty data generated by a digital twin (DT). The combination DT and ML is employed using a Clarke/space vector representation of the inverter electrical variables, thus resulting in a novel feature engineering method to extract the most relevant features that can properly represent the operating condition of the PVPP. The solution that was developed can classify multiple operation conditions of the inverter with high accuracy.},

  year={2023},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={Numerical modeling of ground penetrating radars (GPRs), such as the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, has been extensively used to enhance the interpretation of GPR data and as a key component of full-waveform inversion (FWI). A major drawback of numerical solvers, especially within the context of FWI, is that they are still computationally expensive requiring often unattainable computational resources and access to high-performance computing (HPC). In this work, we present a near real-time deep-learning forward solver for GPR data that can generate entire B-scans, given certain model parameters as inputs. The machine-learning (ML) model is tuned for reinforced concrete slab scenarios, but the same rationale can be applied in a straightforward manner to other applications as well. The training was performed using entirely synthetic data, where a 3-D digital twin based on the 2000-MHz “palm” antenna from Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc. (GSSI) was included in FDTD simulations for the training set. The accuracy of the deep-learning solver is demonstrated with both synthetic and real data from reinforced concrete slabs. The predicted ML responses were in very good agreement with FDTD, showing a high degree of accuracy. The ML solver is then used as part of an FWI algorithm to characterize the concrete slab and estimate the depth and radius of the buried rebars. Coupled FWI with an ML-based forward solver results in significantly less execution times compared to conventional FWI using numerical solvers. The high accuracy of the proposed FWI, combined with the efficiency and speed of the ML-based forward solver, make the proposed scheme an ideal tool for characterizing concrete structures in nondestructive testing.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={60-63},
  abstract={When training convolutional neural networks, noise distribution in data can affect segmentation accuracy. Therefore, many neural networks will strengthen the segmentation ability of the model by artificially adding noise. However, because the noise distribution of the input data is not known, the model training process can only generate random noise, e.g., gaussian noise, but cannot simulate real-world noise. In the medical imaging domain, more attention is paid to the image contours, which can also be used for noising simulation. Meanwhile, considering the existence of rich unlabeled data sets in medical images, this paper proposes a semi-supervised framework for uncertainty estimation by using Monte Carlo Dropout and generates adaptive noise using the uncertainty map. Specifically, the framework consists of three parts, including a noise generation model, a teacher model, and a student model. The noise generation part processes the data input to the other two parts and uses the contour feature identified by the posteriori uncertainty map to simulate priori noise to guide the process of training segmentation model. Meanwhile, the student model updates its parameters based on the teacher model output and the ground truth annotations by minimizing a joint loss. Segmentation experiments on left atrium 3D data show that our method has competitive results with other SOTA semi-supervised methods.},

  abstract={Future smart cities are expected to provide intelligent services such as predictions, detections, and automation through digital twins. However, the creation of digital twins requires the processing of an enormous amount of data, thereby leading to an increase in mobile network traffic. This traffic is produced by applications in user devices and city services, which engage in local consumption at the city scale through sensor and camera devices using mobile networks. Such increased traffic can compromise the communication speed and stability. To alleviate this burden, traffic offloading becomes a crucial consideration in the beyond-5G era. This paper presents a scheme known as Area-Controlled Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking (AMoND). AMoND uses a hierarchical structure of a location layer and an ad-hoc layer to construct area-controlled mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) for mutual support of the digital twin and MANETs. AMoND effectively suppresses mobile network traffic by harnessing the digital twin to assist the MANETs during data collection for the digital twin construction. Importantly, the digital twin used in AMoND focuses on the management of node location information and does not need to reproduce the real space on a computer fully. AMoND is not dependent on a specific MANET protocol and can be used as an add-on. AMoND exhibits the ability to reduce traffic volumes by up to approximately 65%, while maintaining arrival rates that are comparable to existing MANET protocols under certain conditions.},

  abstract={With the emergence of digitalization technology, digital twin bridges the gap between physical and virtual worlds in industrial production with synchronization, reliability, and fidelity. The manufacturing process of complex products needs multiple working procedures, where novel industrial parts occur, causing scenes to be variable for robots to perceive and grasp. Due to the geometric difference among objects in various categories, it is significant to empower robotic systems with the capability of continuous learning for grasp detection in variable scenes. Therefore, a digital twin robotic system is proposed to realize bidirectional real-time data interaction and synchronization in the physical and virtual worlds. In this digital twin robotic system, a synthetic grasp detection dataset composed of industrial parts is built for an industrial grasping task. Besides, a novel deep learning method, adaptive spatial-awareness grasp network with a novel cc, is proposed to realize end-to-end 7-DoF grasp detection for industrial objects. In addition, a continuous learning strategy is proposed for 7-DoF grasp pose detection without catastrophic forgetting in variable scenes. Experiments in both virtual and physical worlds have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method for potential industrial implementation, and the average grasping success rate reaches 91% and 88% for novel objects in the virtual and physical worlds, respectively.},

  abstract={In recent years, online distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for adapting real-time deep neural networks on the fly using a slow, but accurate teacher model. However, a major challenge in online distillation is catastrophic forgetting when the domain shifts, which occurs when the student model is updated with data from the new domain and forgets previously learned knowledge. In this paper, we propose a solution to this issue by leveraging the power of continual learning methods to reduce the impact of domain shifts. Specifically, we integrate several state-of-the-art continual learning methods in the context of online distillation and demonstrate their effectiveness in reducing catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of our proposed solution in the case of cyclic domain shifts. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving the robustness and accuracy of online distillation, with potential applications in domains such as video surveillance or autonomous driving. Overall, our work represents an important step forward in the field of online distillation and continual learning, with the potential to significantly impact real-world applications.},

  pages={1971-1981},
  abstract={Although there are many methods based on deep learning that have superior performance on single image super-resolution (SISR), it is difficult to run in real time on devices with limited computing power. Some recent studies have found that simply relying on reducing parameters or reducing the theoretical FLOPs of the model does not speed up the inference time of the network in a practical sense. Actual speed on the device is probably a better measure than FLOPs. In this work, we propose a new single residual network (SRN). On the one hand, we try to introduce and optimize an attention mechanism module to improve the performance of the network with a relatively small speed loss. On the other hand, we find that residuals in residual blocks do not have a positive impact on networks with adjusted ESA. Therefore, the residual of the network residual block is removed, which not only improves the speed of the network, but also improves the performance of the network. Finally, we reduced the number of channels and the number of residual blocks of the classic model EDSR, and removed the last convolution before the long residual. We set this tuned EDSR as the teacher model and our newly proposed SRN as the student model. Under the joint effect of the original loss and the distillation loss, the performance of the network can be improved without losing the inference time. Combining the above strategies, our proposed model runs much faster than similarly performing models. As an example, we built a Fast and Efficient Network (SRN) and its small version SRN-S, which run 30%-37% faster than the state-of-the-art EISR model: a paper champion RLFN. Furthermore, the shallow version of SRN-S achieves the second-shortest inference time as well as the second-smallest number of activations in the NTIRE2023 challenge. Code will be available at https://github.com/wnxbwyc/SRN.},

  abstract={Along with the advent of COVID-19 epidemic, delivery services have become one of the most common services in our daily life. However, the current services merely assume that the contact for handing over delivery items is denied to avoid facing between carriers and receivers. This extreme concept might lead to the ruin of typical processes for delivery services, such as face-to-face authentication, item checking, and payment in person. So, it may cause insufficiency regarding both sides of the secure item delivery and customers’ personal security. Therefore, this paper comes up with a novel CONTACTFUL delivery service with the digital twin paradigm to resolve contactless problems. The proposed idea establishes two-tier digital twin architecture to arrange digital twins and physical twins of carriers and receivers. Then, inter-digital-twin interaction virtually supports on-site delivery service processes. The inter-twin interaction relies on highly accurate proximity detection for items, carriers, and receivers. So, the proposed scheme considers machine-learning technologies and filtering algorithms to achieve high precision based on mobile-based Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beaconing. This scheme is implemented as a proof-of-concept prototype, and various field data are exploited to build ML-filtering models including their ensemble one. On the steel door, the ensemble model shows an accuracy improvement of 65% compared to SVM, 14% to CNN, and 73% to MLP. On the wood door, the ensemble model shows an accuracy improvement of 21% compared to SVM, 9% to CNN, and 17% to MLP.},

  abstract={Recently, there has been increasing interest in the challenge of how to discriminatively vectorize graphs. To address this, we propose a method called Iterative Graph Self-Distillation (IGSD) which learns graph-level representation in an unsupervised manner through instance discrimination using a self-supervised contrastive learning approach. IGSD involves a teacher-student distillation process that uses graph diffusion augmentations and constructs the teacher model using an exponential moving average of the student model. The intuition behind IGSD is to predict the teacher network representation of the graph pairs under different augmented views. As a natural extension, we also apply IGSD to semi-supervised scenarios by jointly regularizing the network with both supervised and self-supervised contrastive loss. Finally, we show that finetuning the IGSD-trained models with self-training can further improve the graph representation power. Empirically, we achieve significant and consistent performance gain on various graph datasets in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, which well validates the superiority of IGSD.},

  abstract={Current knowledge distillation methods used in object detection often ignore the importance of global information in object detection and the quantity of foreground and background samples is unbalanced in the process of object detection training. Aiming at the above problems, a knowledge distillation method for object detection based on foreground enhancement and spatial frequency is proposed. This method uses the foreground enhancement module to introduce the attention mechanism to enhance the expression ability of the key region in the backbone feature, forcing the student model and the teacher model to focus on the same key region. The spatial frequency module guides the student model to inherit the global information contained in the teacher network by using the property of fast Fourier convolution. The losses of the neck network classifier and the regressor are calculated separately. Finally, all losses are fed into the full connection layer to obtain the final distillation loss. Experiments show that the proposed method can be applied to different object detection frameworks. Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and FCOS with ResNet-50 as the backbone network obtained mAP of 40.8%, 39.9%, and 42.9% on the COCO dataset, respectively, an increase of 2.4%, 2.5%, and 4.4% compared with the benchmark.},

  abstract={Digital twin has been emerging as a promising paradigm that connects physical entities and digital space, and continuously evolves to optimize the physical systems. In this paper, we focus on studying efficient communication and computation scheme when constructing the Marine Internet of Things (M-IoT)’s digital twin with secrecy provisioning. Specifically, the digital twin model is trained based on federated learning, in which all the unmanned surface vehicles deliver the trained models with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to the high altitude platform (HAP) for global model aggregation. Considering the potential eavesdropping on the radio signals of HAP, we utilize the chaotic sequences to spread the model information before the global model broadcasting. In this framework, we aim to minimize the total energy consumption for constructing the digital twin of M-IoT by jointly optimizing the global accuracy, the local accuracy, the HAP’s transmission power and NOMA transmission duration, subject to the secrecy provisioning and latency constraint. An effective low-complexity algorithm is proposed to tackle this joint optimization problem with the use of a layered feature. Finally, numerical results are given to validate the performance gain of the proposed scheme, in comparison with the fixed accuracy scheme, the non-spread spectrum scheme and the time division multiple access transmission scheme.},

  abstract={The main challenge of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) crowd counting is the large domain gap between a synthetic domain with annotations (source) and a real-world domain of interest without annotations (target). Previous mainstream UDA crowd counting methods either employ feature alignment or a semi-supervised learning paradigm via pseudo-labels. We for the first time combine both of their advantages and propose an Adversarial Mean Teacher (AMT) framework. On the one hand, we optimize the student model with domain adversarial learning. On the other hand, we feed perturbed target images to the teacher model to generate pseudo-labels. Furthermore, to improve the quality of the pseudo-labels, we propose an Adaptive Teaching (AT) module, consisting of pseudo-label refinement and credible pseudo-label selection. Concretely, we first generate two candidate pseudo-labels from the prediction of the teacher model and obtain a refined pseudo-label by mixing them at the pixel-level. Moreover, we introduce an auxiliary task of foreground-background classification to assist credible region selection and only activate supervision signals on those regions. Extensive experiments on four real-world crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method namely Cross-Domain Adaptive Teacher (CDAT).

  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD) is a conventional method in the field of deep learning that enables the transfer of dark knowledge from a teacher model to a student model, consequently improving the performance of the student model. In randomized neural networks, due to the simple topology of network architecture and the insignificant relationship between model performance and model size, KD is not able to improve model performance. In this work, we propose a self-distillation pipeline for randomized neural networks: the predictions of the network itself are regarded as the additional target, which are mixed with the weighted original target as a distillation target containing dark knowledge to supervise the training of the model. All the predictions during multi-generation self-distillation process can be integrated by a multi-teacher method. By induction, we have additionally arrived at the methods for infinite self-distillation (ISD) of randomized neural networks. We then provide relevant theoretical analysis about the self-distillation method for randomized neural networks. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in practical applications on several benchmark datasets.},

  title={VulExplainer: A Transformer-Based Hierarchical Distillation for Explaining Vulnerability Types}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={49},
  number={10},
  pages={4550-4565},
  abstract={Deep learning-based vulnerability prediction approaches are proposed to help under-resourced security practitioners to detect vulnerable functions. However, security practitioners still do not know what type of vulnerabilities correspond to a given prediction (aka CWE-ID). Thus, a novel approach to explain the type of vulnerabilities for a given prediction is imperative. In this paper, we propose VulExplainer, an approach to explain the type of vulnerabilities. We represent VulExplainer as a vulnerability classification task. However, vulnerabilities have diverse characteristics (i.e., CWE-IDs) and the number of labeled samples in each CWE-ID is highly imbalanced (known as a highly imbalanced multi-class classification problem), which often lead to inaccurate predictions. Thus, we introduce a Transformer-based hierarchical distillation for software vulnerability classification in order to address the highly imbalanced types of software vulnerabilities. Specifically, we split a complex label distribution into sub-distributions based on CWE abstract types (i.e., categorizations that group similar CWE-IDs). Thus, similar CWE-IDs can be grouped and each group will have a more balanced label distribution. We learn TextCNN teachers on each of the simplified distributions respectively, however, they only perform well in their group. Thus, we build a transformer student model to generalize the performance of TextCNN teachers through our hierarchical knowledge distillation framework. Through an extensive evaluation using the real-world 8,636 vulnerabilities, our approach outperforms all of the baselines by 5%–29%. The results also demonstrate that our approach can be applied to Transformer-based architectures such as CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, and CodeGPT. Moreover, our method maintains compatibility with any Transformer-based model without requiring any architectural modifications but only adds a special distillation token to the input. These results highlight our significant contributions towards the fundamental and practical problem of explaining software vulnerability.},

  pages={1-16},
  abstract={In this article, we investigate an effective energy management scheme in a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular Metaverse synchronization system. UAVs purchase energy resources from an energy service provider (ESP) and collect data for a virtual service provider (VSP) to perform synchronization between physical objects and digital twins (DTs). The key issue is to motivate both ESP and UAVs to participate in the energy trading market. To doing so, we design an incentive mechanism that maximizes the revenue of the ESP while guaranteeing desired economic properties, i.e. individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC). In particular, we first consider a single energy unit market, where a deep learning (DL)-based auction scheme is developed to construct neural networks from the analytical results of Myerson auction. The proposed DL-based auction is guaranteed to fulfill the optimal auction. We then consider a general scenario in which ESP has multiple energy units available to UAVs. A novel DL-based auction with feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) is proposed to jointly optimize the energy unit allocation and payment rules. We provide numerical results to demonstrate the performance improvement of the DL-based auction schemes compared to the classical auctions in terms of revenue, IC and IR. In particular, for the single energy unit market, the proposed DL-based auction scheme significantly improves the revenue compared with the classical auction and more interestingly, is able to avoid prevent UAVs from submitting their false values.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={The deployment of automated deep-learning classifiers in clinical practice has the potential to streamline the diagnosis process and improve the diagnosis accuracy, but the acceptance of those classifiers relies on both their accuracy and interpretability. In general, accurate deep-learning classifiers provide little model interpretability, while interpretable models do not have competitive classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a new deep-learning diagnosis framework, called InterNRL, that is designed to be highly accurate and interpretable. InterNRL consists of a student-teacher framework, where the student model is an interpretable prototype-based classifier (ProtoPNet) and the teacher is an accurate global image classifier (GlobalNet). The two classifiers are mutually optimised with a novel reciprocal learning paradigm in which the student ProtoPNet learns from optimal pseudo labels produced by the teacher GlobalNet, while GlobalNet learns from ProtoPNet’s classification performance and pseudo labels. This reciprocal learning paradigm enables InterNRL to be flexibly optimised under both fully- and semi-supervised learning scenarios, reaching state-of-the-art classification performance in both scenarios for the tasks of breast cancer and retinal disease diagnosis. Moreover, relying on weakly-labelled training images, InterNRL also achieves superior breast cancer localisation and brain tumour segmentation results than other competing methods.},

  year={2023},
  volume={23},
  number={21},
  pages={26765-26775},
  abstract={Myoelectric control is a typical modality of neural interfaces always driven by pattern recognition of surface electromyogram (sEMG). However, due to great cross-user variability, it suffers from severe performance degradation when it is trained on one set of user data and then tested with new user data. To improve its cross-user usability, a dual-step domain adaptation network (DSDAN) is proposed to fully exploit useful information in the training data (source domain) and efficiently deliver it to the testing data from a new user (target domain). The DSDAN is based on bidirectional knowledge distillation (KD) and uses a teacher–student model to implement the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which allows the classification model to adapt to a new user in the testing phase without any labeled data. A bidirectional KD technique was adopted to facilitate mutual learning between the teacher and student networks to address the problem of balancing adaptation speed and accuracy in the UDA. A novel dual-step domain adaptation (DSDA) strategy was utilized to mitigate knowledge obsolescence and error accumulation problems in KD. We evaluated the performance of the DSDAN framework on both high- and low-density sEMG datasets and achieved 98.96 ± 4.91% and 98.09 ± 1.86% recognition accuracies, respectively, which are better than those of mainstream UDA methods ( ${p}< {0.01}$ ). This study demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the DSDAN framework in a cross-user myoelectric control task, which could be applied in gestural interfaces and intelligent robotic control.},

  abstract={The vision of Industry 4.0 introduces new requirements to Operational Technology (OT) systems. Solutions for these requirements already exist in the realm of Information Technology (IT), however, due to the different characteristics of IT and OT, these solutions often cannot be directly used in the realm of OT. We therefore propose an Industrial Business Process Twin (IBPT), allowing to apply methods of one world to another not directly but, instead, to a representation, that is in bidirectional exchange with the other world. The proposed IBPT entity acts as an intermediary, decoupling the realms of IT and OT, thus allowing for an integration of IT and OT components of different manufacturers and platforms. Using this approach, we demonstrate the four essential Industry 4.0 design principles information transparency, technical assistance, interconnection and decentralized decisions based on the gamified Industry 4.0 scenario of playing the game of Nine Men’s Morris. This scenario serves well for agent based Artificial Intelligence (AI)-research and education. We develop an Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) information and communication model and then evaluate the IBPT component with respect to the different views of the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0).},

  abstract={This paper proposes a hybrid computational framework for fault detection during the coil winding manufacturing process by using a combination of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model with a Supervised Machine Learning (SML) algorithm. The conventional End of the Line (EoL) tests are insufficient in detecting faults during process resulting in increased manufacturing costs and lead times. The proposed methodology utilises a Knowledge Distillation (KD) approach to address the challenges associated with the technique and optimise the student model's performance by employing architecture search and data augmentation. Multiple SML algorithms were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in predicting faults during manufacturing. The random forest algorithm demonstrated superior performance due to its ability to handle complex data and identify the impact of interdependencies of process parameters on the final product quality. The method was validated by conducting physical experiments on a linear coil-winding machine, and the results indicated that the random forest algorithm has the potential to decrease simulation time from 2 minutes to less than a second. The proposed methodology has the potential to reduce manufacturing time, enhance stator quality, and ultimately improve their reliability and safety.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have novel features such as multi-stage penetration, highly-tailored intention, and evasive tactics. APTs defense requires fusing multi-dimensional Cyber threat intelligence data to identify attack intentions and conducts efficient knowledge discovery strategies by data-driven machine learning to recognize entity relationships. However, data-driven machine learning lacks generalization ability on fresh or unknown samples, reducing the accuracy and practicality of the defense model. Besides, the private deployment of these APT defense models on heterogeneous environments and various network devices requires significant investment in context awareness (such as known attack entities, continuous network states, and current security strategies). In this paper, we propose a few-shot multi-domain knowledge rearming (FMKR) scheme for context-aware defense against APTs. By completing multiple small tasks that are generated from different network domains with meta-learning, the FMKR firstly trains a model with good discrimination and generalization ability for fresh and unknown APT attacks. In each FMKR task, both threat intelligence and local entities are fused into the support/query sets in meta-learning to identify possible attack stages. Secondly, to rearm current security strategies, an finetuning-based deployment mechanism is proposed to transfer learned knowledge into the student model, while minimizing the defense cost. Compared to multiple model replacement strategies, the FMKR provides a faster response to attack behaviors while consuming less scheduling cost. Based on the feedback from multiple real users of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) over 2 months, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can improve the defense satisfaction rate.},

  abstract={Stereo-based 3D object detection, which aims at detecting 3D objects with stereo cameras, shows great potential in low-cost deployment compared to LiDAR-based methods and excellent performance compared to monocular-based algorithms. However, the impressive performance of stereo-based 3D object detection is at the huge cost of high-quality manual annotations, which are hardly attainable for any given scene. Semi-supervised learning, in which limited annotated data and numerous unannotated data are required to achieve a satisfactory model, is a promising method to address the problem of data deficiency. In this work, we propose to achieve semi-supervised learning for stereo-based 3D object detection through pseudo annotation generation from a temporal-aggregated teacher model, which temporally accumulates knowledge from a student model. To facilitate a more stable and accurate depth estimation, we introduce Temporal-Aggregation-Guided (TAG) disparity consistency, a cross-view disparity consistency constraint between the teacher model and the student model for robust and improved depth estimation. To mitigate noise in pseudo annotation generation, we propose a cross-view agreement strategy, in which pseudo annotations should attain high degree of agreements between 3D and 2D views, as well as between binocular views. We perform extensive experiments on the KITTI 3D dataset to demonstrate our proposed method's capability in leveraging a huge amount of unannotated stereo images to attain significantly improved detection results.},

  abstract={We propose a novel teacher-student model for semi-supervised multi-organ segmentation. In teacher-student model, data augmentation is usually adopted on unlabeled data to regularize the consistent training between teacher and student. We start from a key perspective that fixed relative locationsand variable sizes of different organs can provide distribution information where a multi-organ CT scan is drawn. Thus, we treat the prior anatomy as a strong tool to guide the data augmentation and reduce the mismatch between labeled and unlabeled images for semi-supervised learning. More specifically, we propose a data augmentation strategy based on partition-and-recovery N3 cubes cross-and within-labeled and unlabeled images. Our strategy encourages unlabeled images to learn organ semantics in relative locations from the labeled images (cross-branch) and enhances the learning ability for small organs (within-branch). For within-branch, we further propose to refine the quality of pseudo labels by blending the learned representations from small cubes to incorporate local attributes. Our method is termed as MagicNet, since it treats the CT volume as a magic-cube and N3-cube partition-and-recovery process matches with the rule of playing a magic-cube. Extensive experiments on two public CT multi-organ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MagicNet, and noticeably outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image segmentation approaches, with + 7% DSC improvement on MACT dataset with 10% labeled images.

  abstract={We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework for effectively teaching a sensorimotor student agent to drive from the supervision of a privileged teacher agent. Current distillation for sensorimotor agents methods tend to result in suboptimal learned driving behavior by the student, which we hypothesize is due to inherent differences between the input, modeling capacity, and optimization processes of the two agents. We develop a novel distillation scheme that can address these limitations and close the gap between the sensorimotor agent and its privileged teacher. Our key insight is to design a student which learns to align their input features with the teacher's privileged Bird's Eye View (BEV) space. The student then can benefit from direct supervision by the teacher over the internal representation learning. To scaffold the difficult sensorimotor learning task, the student model is optimized via a student-paced coaching mechanism with various auxiliary supervision. We further propose a high-capacity imitation learned privileged agent that surpasses prior privileged agents in CARLA and ensures the student learns safe driving behavior. Our proposed sensorimotor agent results in a robust image-based behavior cloning agent in CARLA, improving over current models by over 20.6% in driving score without requiring LiDAR, historical observations, ensemble of models, on-policy data aggregation or reinforcement learning.},

  abstract={Test-time adaptation (TTA) intends to adapt the pretrained model to test distributions with only unlabeled test data streams. Most of the previous TTA methods have achieved great success on simple test data streams such as independently sampled data from single or multiple distributions. However, these attempts may fail in dynamic scenarios of real-world applications like autonomous driving, where the environments gradually change and the test data is sampled correlatively over time. In this work, we explore such practical test data streams to deploy the model on the fly, namely practical test-time adaptation (PTTA). To do so, we elaborate a Robust Test-Time Adaptation (RoTTA) method against the complex data stream in PTTA. More specifically, we present a robust batch normalization scheme to estimate the normalization statistics. Meanwhile, a memory bank is utilized to sample category-balanced data with consideration of timeliness and uncertainty. Further, to stabilize the training procedure, we develop a time-aware reweighting strategy with a teacher-student model. Extensive experiments prove that RoTTA enables continual test-time adaptation on the correlatively sampled data streams. Our method is easy to implement, making it a good choice for rapid deployment.

  abstract={Mean ensemble (i.e. averaging predictions from multiple models) is a commonly-used technique in machine learning that improves the performance of each individual model. We formalize it as feature alignment for ensemble in open-set face recognition and generalize it into Bayesian Ensemble Averaging (BEA) through the lens of probabilistic modeling. This generalization brings up two practical benefits that existing methods could not provide: (1) the uncertainty of a face image can be evaluated and further decomposed into aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty, the latter of which can be used as a measure for out-of-distribution detection of faceness; (2) a BEA statistic provably reflects the aleatoric uncertainty of a face image, acting as a measure for face image quality to improve recognition performance. To inherit the uncertainty estimation capability from BEA without the loss of inference efficiency, we propose BEA-KD, a student model to distill knowledge from BEA. BEA-KD mimics the overall behavior of ensemble members and consistently outperforms SOTA knowledge distillation methods on various challenging benchmarks.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={22732-22741},
  abstract={Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have been prevailing paradigms for large-scale vision representation pretraining. By reconstructing masked image patches from a small portion of visible image regions, MAE forces the model to infer semantic correlation within an image. Recently, some approaches apply semantic-rich teacher models to extract image features as the reconstruction target, leading to better performance. However, unlike the low-level features such as pixel values, we argue the features extracted by powerful teacher models already encode rich semantic correlation across regions in an intact image. This raises one question: is reconstruction necessary in Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with a teacher model? In this paper, we propose an efficient MIM paradigm named MaskAlign. MaskAlign simply learns the consistency of visible patch features extracted by the student model and intact image features extracted by the teacher model. To further advance the performance and tackle the problem of input inconsistency between the student and teacher model, we propose a Dynamic Alignment (DA) module to apply learnable alignment. Our experimental results demonstrate that masked modeling does not lose effectiveness even without reconstruction on masked regions. Combined with Dynamic Alignment, MaskAlign can achieve state-of-the-art performance with much higher efficiency. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/OpenPerceptionX/maskalign.},

  abstract={When facing changing environments in the real world, the lightweight model on client devices suffers from severe performance drops under distribution shifts. The main limitations of the existing device model lie in (1) unable to update due to the computation limit of the device, (2) the limited generalization ability of the lightweight model. Meanwhile, recent large models have shown strong generalization capability on the cloud while they can not be deployed on client devices due to poor computation constraints. To enable the device model to deal with changing environments, we propose a new learning paradigm of Cloud-Device Collaborative Continual Adaptation, which encourages collaboration between cloud and device and improves the generalization of the device model. Based on this paradigm, we further propose an Uncertainty-based Visual Prompt Adapted (U-VPA) teacher-student model to transfer the generalization capability of the large model on the cloud to the device model. Specifically, we first design the Uncertainty Guided Sampling (UGS) to screen out challenging data continuously and transmit the most out-of-distribution samples from the device to the cloud. Then we propose a Visual Prompt Learning Strategy with Uncertainty guided updating (VPLU) to specifically deal with the selected samples with more distribution shifts. We transmit the visual prompts to the device and concatenate them with the incoming data to pull the device testing distribution closer to the cloud training distribution. We conduct extensive experiments on two object detection datasets with continually changing environments. Our proposed U-VPA teacher-student framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art test time adaptation and device-cloud collaboration methods. The code and datasets will be released.},

  abstract={Test-time adaptation (TTA) is the problem of updating a pre-trained source model at inference time given test input(s) from a different target domain. Most existing TTA approaches assume the setting in which the target domain is stationary, i.e., all the test inputs come from a single target domain. However, in many practical settings, the test input distribution might exhibit a lifelong/continual shift over time. Moreover, existing TTA approaches also lack the ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates, which is crucial when distribution shifts occur between the source and target domain. To address these issues, we present PETAL (Probabilistic lifElong Test-time Adaptation with self-training prior), which solves lifelong TTA using a probabilistic approach, and naturally results in (1) a student-teacher framework, where the teacher model is an exponential moving average of the student model, and (2) regularizing the model updates at inference time using the source model as a regularizer. To prevent model drift in the lifelong/continual TTA setting, we also propose a data-driven parameter restoration technique which contributes to reducing the error accumulation and maintaining the knowledge of recent domains by restoring only the irrelevant parameters. In terms of predictive error rate as well as uncertainty based metrics such as Brier score and negative log-likelihood, our method achieves better results than the current state-of-the-art for online lifelong test-time adaptation across various benchmarks, such as CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNetC, and ImageNet3DCC datasets. The source code for our approach is accessible at https://github.com/dhanajitb/petal.},

  abstract={This paper explores the tasks of leveraging auxiliary modalities which are only available at training to enhance multimodal representation learning through cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (KD). The widely adopted mutual information maximization-based objective leads to a short-cut solution of the weak teacher, i.e., achieving the maximum mutual information by simply making the teacher model as weak as the student model. To prevent such a weak solution, we introduce an additional objective term, i.e., the mutual information between the teacher and the auxiliary modality model. Besides, to narrow down the information gap between the student and teacher, we further propose to minimize the conditional entropy of the teacher given the student. Novel training schemes based on contrastive learning and adversarial learning are designed to optimize the mutual information and the conditional entropy, respectively. Experimental results on three popular multimodal benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed method outperforms a range of state-of-the-art approaches for video recognition, video retrieval and emotion classification.},

  volume={},

  pages={16006-16015},
  abstract={Previous Knowledge Distillation based efficient image retrieval methods employ a lightweight network as the stu-dent model for fast inference. However, the lightweight stu-dent model lacks adequate representation capacity for effective knowledge imitation during the most critical early training period, causing final performance degeneration. To tackle this issue, we propose a Capacity Dynamic Distillation framework, which constructs a student model with editable representation capacity. Specifically, the employed student model is initially a heavy model to fruitfully learn distilled knowledge in the early training epochs, and the stu-dent model is gradually compressed during the training. To dynamically adjust the model capacity, our dynamic frame-work inserts a learnable convolutional layer within each residual block in the student model as the channel importance indicator. The indicator is optimized simultaneously by the image retrieval loss and the compression loss, and a retrieval- guided gradient resetting mechanism is proposed to release the gradient conflict. Extensive experiments show that our method has superior inference speed and accu-racy, e.g., on the VeRi-776 dataset, given the ResNet101 as a teacher, our method saves 67.13% model parameters and 65.67% FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy.

  abstract={Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims at distilling the knowledge from the large teacher model to a lightweight student model. Mainstream KD methods can be divided into two categories, logit distillation, and feature distillation. The former is easy to implement, but inferior in performance, while the latter is not applicable to some practical circumstances due to concerns such as privacy and safety. Towards this dilemma, in this paper, we explore a stronger logit distillation method via making better utilization of logit outputs. Concretely, we propose a simple yet effective approach to logit distillation via multi-level prediction alignment. Through this framework, the prediction alignment is not only conducted at the instance level, but also at the batch and class level, through which the student model learns instance prediction, input correlation, and category correlation simultaneously. In addition, a prediction augmentation mechanism based on model calibration further boosts the performance. Extensive experiment results validate that our method enjoys consistently higher performance than previous logit distillation methods, and even reaches competitive performance with mainstream feature distillation methods.

  abstract={Many data sets for supervised learning have been created throughout the machine learning era, and without a doubt, many others are in the evolution process. Graph neural network (GNN), the youngest artificial neural network technique, is also characterized by a need to have and see specific patterns that a model with a particular architecture might learn. The following lines describe the dataset consisting of graphs with nodes of information created based on simple Finite Element structural models (GF dataset) designed to explore the possibilities of a specific hybrid modelling technique suggested as a bridge connecting a Finite Element (FE) Method and a Graph Neural Network into an effective tool for the purpose to creating a Digital Twin of a mechanical system.GF Dataset had been briefly evaluated to set the initial benchmark. However, the designed experiment also showed the feasibility of solving multi-regressive tasks with standard machine learning techniques. As a result, the first urgent need to use graph neural networks for mimicking simple physical-based FE models was diminished. Regardless of the results, the GF dataset is still decisively determined as a valuable initiative to explore possibilities of GNN involvement not only in system control through digital twinning.},

  abstract={Stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) have been widely used as predictive models to model complex nonlinear systems due to their advantages in terms of easy-to-implement, fast learning speed, and universal approximation property. In many fields, however, the data generated by nonlinear systems are often characterized by dynamic time series and nonstationary, which result in the learner model with poor generalization performance. This article presents an online self-learning stochastic configuration network to improve the continuous learning ability of SCNs to model nonstationary data streams. The method can autonomously adjust the parameters and structure of the network according to the real-time arriving data streams. Specifically, we use a recursive learning mechanism to update the network parameters online based on the data acquired in real time. In addition, the structure of the SCNs is dynamically adjusted by sensitivity analysis and stochastic configuration algorithm to improve the adaptive and continuous learning capability of the network. A series of comparisons are carried out over two benchmark datasets and one practical industrial case from the wastewater treatment process to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has good potential for nonstationary data stream analysis.},

  pages={370-375},
  abstract={Deep learning has become an attractive choice for indoor positioning systems (IPS) because of its ability to be more accurate in dealing with phenomena such as multipath and shadowing. However, mobile and edge devices in an IPS environment usually have limited resources, making deep learning deployment challenging. Our research aim is to implement knowledge distillation for a deep neural network (DNN)-based IPS that is lightweight in an edge environment. The first step in our research is to collect a dataset regarding IPS, which contains distance data to three beacons as well as the position of the mobile phone in the room and determines the location based on the two outputs, namely Position X and Position Y. Then we design knowledge distillation for DNN to realize the compression model. We prove our compressed model by comparing the student model with the teacher model and the student model without the teacher model. We use several test metrics, including accuracy, loss, number of model parameters (Params), and compression ratio (CR). The test results show that the accuracy of the student with the teacher model outperforms the student without the teacher model, namely 0.8 compared to 0.776 for Position X and 0.96 compared to 0.88 for Position Y. Our research concludes that our knowledge distillation model for IPS can perform compression with $\mathrm{CR}=10.2 \times$ while having better performance than the model without knowledge distillation.},

  abstract={Digital twin has become a widely discussed emerging topic in last few years, which is expected to bring a new revolution to the whole life cycle of complex equipment, including R&D design, optimization control and predictive maintenance. Using online real-time sensor data to realize model dynamic evolution, so as to map the state change of physical equipment faithfully, is the most significant feature of digital twin and is also one of the most important key technologies of digital twin. Lifelong learning is a feasible way to realize digital twin dynamic evolution. By using offline historical data and online real-time data, the digital twin model built in data-driven modeling manner can evolve continuously, therefore, the accuracy of predictive simulation can be guaranteed and improved. Simultaneously, to make a balance between the computation cost and dynamic evolution performance, we introduce the event-triggered scheme during online lifelong learning process. To sum up, a lifelong learning method based on event-triggered online Frozen-EWC Transformer Encoder for equipment digital twin dynamic evolution has been proposed in this paper and the real flight dataset of quadrotor aircraft is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation, a widely adopted model compression technique, distils knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model, with the goal of reducing the computational resources required for the student model. However, most existing distillation approaches focus on the types of knowledge and how to distil them, which neglect the student model's neuronal responses to the knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that the kullback-leibler loss inhibits the neuronal responses in the opposite gradient direction, which injures the student model's potential during distilling. To address this problem, we introduce a principled dual-stage distillation scheme to rejuvenate all inhibited neurons at the neuronal level. In the first stage, we detect all the neurons in the student model during the standard distillation period and divide them into two parts according to their responses. In the second stage, we propose three strategies to resuscitate the neurons differently, which allows us to exploit the full potential of the student model. Through the experiments in various aspects of knowledge distillation, it is verified that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches. Our work provides a neuronal perspective for studying the response of the student model to the knowledge from the teacher model.},

  abstract={The rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) penetration has led to more flexible and reliable vehicle-to-grid-enabled cyber-physical systems (V2G-CPSs). However, the increasing system complexity also makes them more vulnerable to cyber-physical threats. Coordinated cyber attacks (CCAs) have emerged as a major concern, requiring effective detection and mitigation strategies within V2G-CPSs. Digital twin (DT) technologies have shown promise in mitigating system complexity and providing diverse functionalities for complex tasks such as system monitoring, analysis, and optimal control. This paper presents a resilient and secure framework for CCA detection and mitigation in V2G-CPSs, leveraging a smart DT-enabled approach. The framework introduces a smarter DT orchestrator that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) based actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (LSTM-DRL) in the DT virtual replica. The LSTM algorithm estimates the system states, which are then used by the DRL network to detect CCAs and take appropriate actions to minimize their impact. To validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed smart DT framework, case studies are conducted on an IEEE 30 bus system-based V2G-CPS, considering different CCA types such as malicious V2G node or control command attacks. The results demonstrate that the framework is capable of accurately estimating system states, detecting various CCAs, and mitigating the impact of attacks within 5 seconds.},

Existing works generally synthesize data from the pretrained teacher model to replace the original training data for student learning. To more effectively train the student model, the synthetic data shall be customized to the current student learning ability. However, this is ignored in the existing DFKD methods and thus negatively affects the student training. To address this issue, we propose Customizing Synthetic Data for Data-Free Student Learning (CSD) in this paper, which achieves adaptive data synthesis using a self-supervised augmented auxiliary task to estimate the student learning ability. That is, data synthesis is dynamically adjusted to enlarge the cross entropy between the labels and the predictions from the self-supervised augmented task, thus generating the hard samples for the student model.

  abstract={Recently, there has been increasing interest in the Source-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection task, which involves training an object detector on the unlabeled target data using a pre-trained source model without accessing the source data. Most related methods are developed from the mean-teacher framework, which aims to train the student model closer to the teacher model via a pseudo labeling manner, where the teacher model is the exponential-moving-average of the student models at different time-steps. Following this line of works, we propose a Run-and-Chase Mutual-Learning method to strengthen the interactions between the student model and the teacher model in both feature and prediction levels. In our method, the student model is optimized to run away from the teacher model at the feature level, while chasing the teacher model at the prediction level. In this way, the student model is forced to be distinguishable at different time-steps, so that the teacher model can acquire more diverse task-related information and produce higher-accuracy pseudo labels. As the training goes, the student and teacher models are updated iteratively and promoted mutually, which can prevent the model collapse problem. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method.},

Mean-Teacher (MT) scheme with teacher-student model architecture has shown its effectiveness in semi-supervised medical image segmentation, where the student network learns from the teacher by minimizing pixel-wise consistency loss. However, existing MT-based SSLs still give rise to two main concerns: (1) limited learning ability of student network that neglects the union of local feature and global cues extraction which may impact the representation learning of variable objects. (2) limited knowledge-transferring ability of teacher network with only pixel-level consistency regularization that may result in inadequate and unstable guidance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning scheme, namely MedFCT, with two appealing designs: (1) A dual student architecture with parallel CNN and Transformer branches is designed for local-global feature extraction, where the full-frequency interaction between CNN and Transformer can be explored by a frequency domain cross-fusion (FDCF) module to learn complementarity of the two-paradigm features. (2) A comprehensive multi-level consistency regularization considering pixel-wise, feature-wise and class-wise information is presented to realize more effective guidance and knowledge transfer from teacher network. Experiments show that MedFCT outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on two public medical image segmentation benchmarks.},

Therefore, we propose a consistent teacher-student model for magnetic resonance image segmentation, which is abbreviated as CTSSeg. Specifically, the CTSSeg includes a student network and a teacher network, where the student network learns supervised from labeled data, while the teacher network utilizes unlabeled data to improve the student network via contrastive learning and pseudo-label learning.

  abstract={Knowledge distillation enhances the performance of the student model by transferring knowledge from the teacher model. Moreover, the attention mechanism has been introduced recently to enable each layer of the student to learn knowledge from all teacher layers, which brings about considerable optimization. However, noted that features from different layers, such as shallow and deep layers, might have a big semantic gap, and compulsively aligning one student layer to all teacher layers would mislead the learning process. To tackle this problem, an effective framework called Semantic Stage-Wise learning for Knowledge Distillation (SSWKD) is presented in this paper. We divide all layers into shallow and deep stages, and only allow feature alignment within the same stage to alleviate semantic mismatch. In addition, with the observation that the performance of deep networks relies more on some key features rather than evenly on all of them, a crucial feature enhancement method based on KL divergence is then proposed for SSWKD, forcing the student to pay more attention to critical features of the teacher. Extensive experiments and visualizations show that our SSWKD outperforms other distillation methods on CIFAR-100 and COCO2017 datasets for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.},

Conventional traffic prediction models are firstly reviewed. The challenges of DTN traffic prediction are analyzed. On that basis, a spatiotemporal-enhanced recurrent neural network (RNN) based approach is elaborated to accurately predict the background traffic matrices of target LANs. Experiments compare this proposed model with four baseline models, including LSTM, CNN-LSTM, ConvLSTM, and PredRNN. The results turn out that the spatiotemporal-enhanced RNN model outperforms the baselines on accuracy. In particular, it can decrease the MSE of PredRNN more than 18%, with acceptable efficiency degradation.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) and new developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enhanced technologies based on smart cities, such as smart transportation, smart healthcare, and smart environmental management (IoT). Artificial intelligence (AI) was used to build virtual Digital Twins (DT), which are exact duplicates of real objects. DT uses in the manufacturing and industrial sectors have been successful, but smart city applications are still in their infancy. The primary reasons for this delay are a lack of confidence and privacy concerns around the transmission of sensitive data. DT may be used in combination with Federated Learning (FL) to ensure dependability and privacy preservation. In order to facilitate governance in smart city applications and their adoption in circumstances where time is of the essence and lives are on the line, the primary goal of this study is to merge these two cutting-edge technologies. The use of technology, businesses now create better products, identify and swiftly fix physical issues, and realize value and advantages more quickly than in the past. Give a complete examination of the various DTs for smart cities using FL model applications. The study's findings are utilized to pinpoint a few important problems and suggest solutions for enhancing FL-DT integration in applications.},

  abstract={Health Digital Twins (HDTs) are virtual replicas of a patient’s physical/actual data. The major setbacks for applying Machine Learning (ML) in HDTs are the lack of availability of patients’ data due to privacy concerns and Artificial Intelligence (AI) bias. Given these shortcomings, synthetic data has been leveraged to solve privacy issues and increase diversity in datasets. In this paper, we evaluate four synthetic data generation models namely, Gaussian Copula, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN), CopulaGAN, and Tabular Variational Autoencoder (TVAE) which are used to generate synthetic data for actual sleep data retrieved from a wearable device. Gaussian Copula performed best in capturing the correlation between the variables with the real data with a quality score of approximately 96%. Additionally, we evaluate the efficacy of the synthetic generation models by training five well-known ML models on the generated synthetic data. Our experimental results show that the ML models trained on the synthetic data achieve an MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of less than 10% in the prediction of sleep quality score. The results from this work indicate that synthetic data could be used for ML tasks while preserving the privacy of data subjects.},

  abstract={Innovative solutions are required to sustain the balance between energy generation and demand to achieve the desired efficiency in the power system and microgrid. With the recent advances in information and communication technologies that provide energy solution services based on big data analytics, machine learning (ML), and IoT technologies, the concept of digital twins (DT) has been introduced as a constructible active model to improve the security and resiliency of the microgrid. The DT is a reliable and economic microgrid technology considering its advantages of virtual real-time simulation, physical-based control, and constant monitoring. Moreover, DTs can predict future performance, energy consumers' behaviour, and a complex system's maintenance. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for adapting the DT into applying a microgrid that interacts with the control system to ensure its information security and proper operation.

To tackle the formulated non-convex optimization problem, we first model it as a Markov decision process (MDP), and later we adopt a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to solve it effectively.

  abstract={Technology advancements in wireless communications and high-performance Extended Reality (XR) have empowered the developments of the Metaverse. The demand for Metaverse applications and hence, real-time digital twinning of real-world scenes is increasing. Nevertheless, the replication of 2D physical world images into 3D virtual world scenes is computationally intensive and requires computation offloading. The disparity in transmitted scene dimension (2D as opposed to 3D) leads to asymmetric data sizes in uplink (UL) and downlink (DL). To ensure the reliability and low latency of the system, we consider an asynchronous joint UL-DL scenario where the smaller data size of the physical world scenes captured in the UL will be uploaded to the Metaverse Console (MC) to be construed and rendered, and the larger-size 3D virtual world scenes need to be transmitted back in DL. The decisions pertaining to computation offloading and channel assignment are optimized in the UL stage, and the MC will optimize power allocation for users assigned with a channel in the UL transmission stage. To ensure the reliability and low latency of the system, we design a novel Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) structure, namely Asynchronous Actors Hybrid Critic (AAHC). The simulation experiments demonstrate that compared to the proposed baselines, AAHC obtains better solutions with a preferable training time.},

  abstract={Recognizing objects in low-resolution images is a challenging task due to the lack of informative details. Recent studies have shown that knowledge distillation approaches can effectively transfer knowledge from a high-resolution teacher model to a low-resolution student model by aligning cross-resolution representations. However, these approaches still face limitations in adapting to the situation where the recognized objects exhibit significant representation discrepancies between training and testing images. In this study, we propose a cross-resolution relational contrastive distillation approach to facilitate low-resolution object recognition. Our approach enables the student model to mimic the behavior of a well-trained teacher model which delivers high accuracy in identifying high-resolution objects. To extract sufficient knowledge, the student learning is supervised with contrastive relational distillation loss, which preserves the similarities in various relational structures in contrastive representation space. In this manner, the capability of recovering missing details of familiar low-resolution objects can be effectively enhanced, leading to a better knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on low-resolution object classification and low-resolution face recognition clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our approach.},

  year={2023},

  number={},
  pages={1-12},
  abstract={Automatic building instance extraction from high-resolution (HR) remote sensing imagery (RSI) is crucial for urban planning and mapping. The dominant approaches are based on the full-supervised learning paradigm that requires a large number of labeled samples to train their models, which is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. To alleviate this problem, this study proposes a semisupervised building instance extraction method that integrates teacher–student learning and pseudo-labeling to improve the building instance extraction from HR RSI. Specifically, the proposed method consists of three modules, the hybrid data augmentation (HDA) module, the pseudo-label generation (PLG) module, and the contour refinement (CR) module. The HDA module is designed to enrich the diversity of labeled samples to optimize the teacher model. The PLG module generates pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to train a student model with pseudo-labels. Finally, the CR module is designed to refine the contours of buildings. Experimental results on three challenging public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance and exhibits great robustness at different proportions of labeled data and different building scenarios. This study provides a new approach for extracting building instances from HR RSI in scenarios with insufficient labeled samples and a methodological reference for various applications of semisupervised on RSIs.},

  abstract={In the context of the 5G/6G mobile network, high levels of requirements such as ultra-high data transmission rate, support for the high mobility node and seamless connection need to be handled. Additionally, ensuring user quality of service (QoS) in high-density and high-traffic mobile networks presents a significant challenge. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as key components in providing flexible assistance in aerial spaces. To further enhance the network performance in dynamic and heterogeneous environments, an intelligent resource allocation strategy with low communication overhead is essential. In this paper, we construct a UAV-assisted mobile network to provide efficient communication for all mobile users in high-density and high-traffic environments, at the same time, a digital twin-empowered dynamic resource allocation strategy based on online training with low communication overhead is proposed. Our proposal employs digital twin-empowered multi-task learning to meet various resource allocation requirements for different node types. Moreover, we propose a deep-Q network-based reinforcement learning mechanism with experience replay memory to execute resource allocation decisions based on evaluated rewards. The simulation results show that the proposal achieves significant network performance compared with baseline algorithms.},

  abstract={With the continuous evolution of emerging technologies such as mobile network, machine learning (ML), 5G, etc., digital twins (DT) bursts out great potential by its capacity of data analysis, data tracking, data prediction, etc, building a bridge between the physical and information world. Meanwhile, mobile network is moving towards data-driven paradigm, the issue of data privacy and data security seem to be a bottleneck. As a result, federated learning (FL) and mobile network are deeply converging. However, the mobile network is time-varying and the parameters of FL-empowered mobile network is huge and continue to increase with exponential growth of wireless terminals, result in the failure of traditional modeling. In the mobile networks, DT is conducive to prototyping, testing, and optimization, enabling mobile networks to be modelled more efficiently in a virtual environment and thus providing guidance for practical application. To this end, a communication-assisted sensing scenario is considered in this paper with FL in DT-empowered mobile networks. More specifically, two communication-assisted sensing architectures are proposed to improve communication efficiency of mobile network, namely, centralized architecture of federated transfer learning (FTL) and decentralized architecture of FTL. For centralized architecture of FTL, feature extraction of sensing information is conducted by FL between partial nodes and central server while the remaining nodes are used to train the fully connected layers at the central server. Considering data safety during the communication between sensing nodes, a decentralized architecture is designed based on FTL and Blockchain, where the feature extraction module is obtained by the fusion of sharing model (by Blockchain) and local model. The performance of proposed schemes is evaluated and demonstrated by the simulations.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the manufacturing process in the industry. It has created a new ecosystem allowing a diversified set of devices to be controlled remotely with minimal human intervention. Today, with the advances in intelligence, processing, storage, communication, and networking capabilities of IoT devices, we are one step closer to realizing the vision of Industry 4.0. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are now significantly more intelligent and automated with the aid of advances in Machine Learning (ML). Intelligent IoT (IIoT), Digital Twins (DT) and the advances in mobile networks are now paving the path towards decentralized self-managed CPS in the industry. DT permits mobile networks to provide adaptive and dynamic configurations for cooperative CPS. Moreover, trustworthy cooperation may be realized with blockchain. In this article, we present a blockchain-assisted hierarchical federated learning (FL)-enabled platform (HFL) for Industry 4.0. The solution integrates DT into CPS to accurately capture the characteristics of industrial IoT devices and assist in the HFL process. A two-stage FL algorithm is used that groups Internet-enabled factory machinery and their DTs into groups in accordance with their organizational structure. A global model is created for the groups from the averaged local models and the DT model in the first stage. During the second stage, federated aggregation is used to create a global model from the first-stage models. Blockchain is used to cross-verify and validate newly added blocks with the support of validator nodes. Numerical analysis is performed to compare between the presented DT-enabled and blockchain-assisted HFL solution and benchmark solutions in terms of network overhead, block optimization, and accuracy.},

  abstract={The advancement of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technology has resulted in the fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, enabling industries to enhance productivity. However, despite the benefits, there remain significant challenges, such as resource heterogeneity, communication efficiency, and data privacy, that limit the applications of IIoT in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare. In order to protect data privacy, Federated Learning (FL) has been suggested as a solution, involving the sharing of model parameters rather than data itself. Current FL applications, however, still struggle with cost efficiency, especially when IIoT devices with heterogenous resources are involved. To address this, this paper proposes Digital Twin (DT) enabled Asynchronous SplitFed Learning (DT-ASFL) for classification tasks in the e-healthcare system over mobile networks. We first develop SplitFed Learning to introduce communication efficiency in the e-healthcare system, sending only extracted features during the learning process instead of the entire learning model. This enables resource-constrained devices to participate in the learning process by allowing the participants to train a partial learning model. DT is then employed to provide real-time statuses of IIoT devices deployed in the system, enabling asynchronous model updates in SplitFed Learning. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of DT-ASFL compared to the existing methods.},

  abstract={Collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) is a new paradigm that allows cooperative peer offloading among distributed MEC servers to balance their computing workloads. However, the highly dynamic workloads and wireless network conditions pose great challenges to achieving efficient task offloading in collaborative MEC. To address this challenge, digital twin (DT) has emerged as one promising solution by building a high-fidelity virtual mirror of the physical MEC to simulate its behaviors and help make optimal operational decisions. In this paper, we propose a DT-driven intelligent task offloading framework for collaborative MEC, where DT is employed to map the collaborative MEC system into a virtual space and optimize the task offloading decisions. We model the task offloading process as a Markov decision process (MDP) with the objective of maximizing the MEC system’s total income from providing computing services, and then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based intelligent task offloading scheme (INTO) to jointly optimize the peer offloading and resource allocation decisions. An efficient action refinement method is proposed to ensure that the action selected by the DRL agent is feasible. Experimental results show that our proposed approach can effectively adapt the task offloading decisions according to the dynamic environment, and significantly improve the MEC system’s income through extensive comparison with three state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract={Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) is a promising paradigm that exposes Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) to road scenarios. In VEC, task offloading can enable vehicles to offload the computing tasks to nearby Roadside Units (RSUs) that deploy computing capabilities. However, the highly dynamic network topology, strict low-delay constraints, and massive data of tasks of VEC pose significant challenges for implementing efficient offloading. Digital Twin-based VEC is emerging as a promising solution that enables real-time monitoring of the state of the VEC network through mapping and interaction between the physical and virtual worlds, thus assisting in making sound offload decisions in the physical world. Thus, this paper proposes an intelligent partial offloading scheme, namely, Digital Twin-Assisted Intelligent Partial Offloading (IGNITE). First, to find the optimal offloading space in advance, we combine the improved clustering algorithm with the Digital Twin (DT) technique, in which unreasonable decisions can be avoided by reducing the size of the decision space. Second, to reduce the overall cost of the system, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is employed to train the offloading strategy, allowing for automatic optimization of computational delay and vehicle service price. To improve the efficiency of cooperation between digital and physical spaces, a feedback mechanism is established. It can adjust the parameters of the clustering algorithm based on the final offloading results in this clustering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on DT-assisted vehicle offloading that proposes a feedback mechanism, forming a complete closed loop as prediction-offloading-feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IGNITE has significant advantages in terms of total system computational cost, total computational delay, and offloading success rate compared with its counterparts.},

  abstract={Due to the distributed collaboration and privacy protection features, federated learning is a promising technology to perform the model training in virtual twins of Digital Twin for Mobile Networks (DTMN). In order to enhance the reliability of the model, it is always expected that the users involved in federated learning have trustworthy behaviors. Yet, available trust evaluation schemes for federated learning have the problems of considering simplex evaluation factor and using coarse-grained trust calculation method. In this paper, we propose a trust evaluation scheme for federated learning in DTMN, which takes direct trust evidence and recommended trust information into account. A user behavior model is designed based on multiple attributes to depict users’ behavior in a fine-grained manner. Furthermore, the trust calculation methods for local trust value and recommended trust value of a user are proposed using the data of user behavior model as trust evidence. Several experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The results show that the proposed method is able to evaluate the trust levels of users with different behavior patterns accurately. Moreover, it performs better in resisting attacks from users that alternately execute good and bad behaviors compared with state-of-the-art scheme.

  abstract={Ensuring reliable update and evolution of a virtual twin in human digital twin (HDT) systems depends on any connectivity scheme implemented between such a virtual twin and its physical counterpart. The adopted connectivity scheme must consider HDT-specific requirements including privacy, security, accuracy and the overall connectivity cost. This paper presents a new, secure, privacy-preserving and efficient human-to-virtual twin connectivity scheme for HDT by integrating three key techniques: differential privacy, federated multi-task learning and blockchain. Specifically, we adopt federated multi-task learning, a personalized learning method capable of providing higher accuracy, to capture the impact of heterogeneous environments. Next, we propose a new validation process based on the quality of trained models during the federated multi-task learning process to guarantee accurate and authorized model evolution in the virtual environment. The proposed framework accelerates the learning process without sacrificing accuracy, privacy and communication costs which, we believe, are non-negotiable requirements of HDT networks. Finally, we compare the proposed connectivity scheme with related solutions and show that the proposed scheme can enhance security, privacy and accuracy while reducing the overall connectivity cost.},

  abstract={This paper puts forth a new, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted, uplink, user-centric cell-free (UCCF) system managed with the assistance of a digital twin (DT). Specifically, we propose a novel learning framework that maximizes the sum-rate by jointly optimizing the access point and user association (AUA), power control, and RIS beamforming. This problem is challenging and has never been addressed due to its prohibitively large and complex solution space. Our framework decouples the AUA from the power control and RIS beamforming (PCRB) based on the different natures of their variables, hence reducing the solution space. A new position-adaptive binary particle swarm optimization (PABPSO) method is designed for the AUA. Two twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) models with new and refined state pre-processing layers are developed for the PCRB. Another important aspect is that a DT is leveraged to train the learning framework with its replay of channel estimates stored. The AUA, power control, and RIS beamforming are only tested in the physical environment at the end of selected epochs. Simulations show that using RISs contributes to considerable increases in the sum-rate of UCCF systems, and the DT dramatically reduces overhead with marginal performance loss. The proposed framework is superior to its alternatives in terms of sum-rate and convergence stability.},

  abstract={Commonly adopted in the manufacturing and aerospace sectors, digital twin (DT) platforms are increasingly seen as a promising paradigm to control, monitor, and analyze software-based, “open”, communication systems that are expected to dominate 6G deployments. Notably, DT platforms provide a sandbox in which to test artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for communication systems, potentially reducing the need to collect data and test algorithms in the field, i.e., on the physical twin (PT). A key challenge in the deployment of DT systems is to ensure that virtual control optimization, monitoring, and analysis at the DT are safe and reliable, avoiding incorrect decisions caused by “model exploitation”. To address this challenge, this paper presents a general Bayesian framework with the aim of quantifying and accounting for model uncertainty at the DT that is caused by limitations in the amount and quality of data available at the DT from the PT. In the proposed framework, the DT builds a Bayesian model of the communication system, which is leveraged to enable core DT functionalities such as control via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), monitoring of the PT for anomaly detection, prediction, data-collection optimization, and counterfactual analysis. To exemplify the application of the proposed framework, we specifically investigate a case-study system encompassing multiple sensing devices that report to a common receiver. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian framework as compared to standard frequentist model-based solutions.},

  pages={3690-3701},
  abstract={The rapid development of Internet of Things has led more realization of digital twins (DT), such as healthcare, smart homes, virtual reality, etc., gesture recognition is a fundamental component of DT. Its implementation can provide users with personalized services or improved human-computer interaction, such as smart home control, in-car interaction, etc., most of existing gesture recognition methods are based on vision or wearable device. However, the vision-based methods face the problem of privacy breach, whereas the wearable-based methods may bring inconvenience to users. With the wide deployment of Wi-Fi networks, lots of consumer devices are widely accessible in people’s homes. Motivated by the fact that Wi-Fi signal propagation can be affected by human motion, the opportunity to use Wi-Fi signals for gesture recognition can be further explored. However, the challenge is that the received Wi-Fi signal shows great differences when the same person performs the same gesture in different environments or different person performs the same gesture in the same environment. Therefore, the signal alignment across different domain needs to be solved. In this paper, we propose a gesture recognition system named Phase-Attention-based-Conv-CSI (PAC-CSI), which consists of two modules: data processing and gesture recognition. In the data processing module, we eliminate random phase noise in channel state information (CSI) and perform phase calibration. In the gesture recognition module, we feed the processed phase sequence into a lightweight deep neural network for gesture recognition. PAC-CSI can obtain the gesture category in about 200ms, which can meets the real-time requirements of DT. The gesture recognition accuracy of our proposed system in a single domain is 99.46%, and its performance across new locations, orientations, users, and environments is 98.77%, 98.90%, 97.54%, and 96.47%, respectively.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a key enabler for the intelligent-oriented evolution of mobile networks. With the rise of privacy concerns for enabling intelligent applications in DT-empowered mobile networks (DTMNs), federated learning has garnered wide attention due to its potential on breaking down data silos. However, the data privacy of federated learning is greatly threatened by emerging gradient leakage attacks, and the need for frequent knowledge exchange limits its training efficiency over resource-constrained DTMNs. To circumvent such dilemmas, this work first proposes a privacy-enhanced federated learning framework based on cloud-edge-client collaborations. Particularly, model splitting between clients and edge servers makes gradient leakage attacks computationally prohibitive, and cloud-side partial model aggregation provides hierarchical data utility. To improve the training efficiency of the proposed learning framework, we further establish its communication and computation cost models, and develop a DT-assisted multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based resource scheduler for joint client association and channel assignment. Finally, as a case study of intelligent applications in DTMNs, a human-robot collaborative nursing task is designed to evaluate the practical performance of our proposed scheduler. Experimental results show its superiority in saving training costs and preserving learning accuracy.},

  year={2023},
  volume={41},
  number={11},
  pages={3369-3385},
  abstract={Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a promising technology for improving resource allocation decisions in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks. In this paper, we consider an IoV network where mobile edge computing (MEC) servers are deployed at the roadside units (RSUs). The IoV network provides ubiquitous connections even in areas uncovered by RSUs with the assistance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which can act as a relay between RSUs and task vehicles. A virtual representation of the IoV network is established in the aerial network as DT which captures the dynamics of the entities of the physical network in real-time in order to perform efficient resource allocation for delay-intolerant tasks. We investigate an intelligent delay-sensitive task offloading scheme for the dynamic vehicular environment which provides computation resources via local execution, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and vehicle-to-roadside-unit (V2I) offloading modes based on the energy consumption of the system. Moreover, we also propose a multi-network deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation algorithm (RADiT) in the DT-assisted network for maximizing the utility of the IoV network while optimizing the task offloading strategy. Further, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with and without the presence of V2V computation mode. RADiT is further evaluated by comparing it with another benchmark DRL algorithm called soft actor-critic (SAC) and a non-DRL approach called greedy. Finally, simulations are performed to demonstrate that the utility of the proposed RADiT algorithm is higher under every condition compared to its respective conditions in SAC and greedy approach. Consequently, the proposed framework jointly improves energy efficiency and reduces the overall delay of the network. The proposed algorithm with UAV relay further increases the efficiency of the network by increasing the task completion rate.},

  title={An Intelligent Digital Twin Method Based on Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion for IoT Attack Behavior Identification}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={41},

  pages={3561-3572},
  abstract={Network attack identification effectively secures Internet of Things (IoT) application scenarios. However, dynamic scene changes, attack feature reliance, high data dimensions, and challenges with spatio-temporal feature fusion frequently pose limitations to attack traffic identification in IoT contexts. Definitive intelligent IoT attack identification enables intelligent algorithms to extract attack features for application scenarios with fixed topological environments but cannot construct the intricate changes of IoT application scenarios. Through the dynamic acquisition, feature awareness, and deep learning, intelligent digital twin-based attack detection can address these issues and enhance attack identification for IoT threats. Thus, this paper proposed an intelligent digital twin method based on spatio-temporal feature fusion for IoT attack behavior identification. Firstly, feature subsets are selected based on information gain to reduce the dimensionality of IoT data with high traffic; Secondly, a parallel spatio-temporal feature extraction model is designed unlike the existing tandem model, which uses a simplified Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model to learn the spatial features of the attack, a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model to learn the temporal features of the attack, an attention mechanism to fuse the temporal and spatial features, and the (Deep Neural Networks) DNN to learn the combined features; Finally, the virtual instance space and topology of the attack scenario are simulated using digital twin (DT) to build a digital version of the complex system for IoT applications and tested in a simulation environment. Based on experimental results using the UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017 datasets, this paper shows that the proposed method can extract spatio-temporal features from network attack traffic and has a 5% improvement in test accuracy.},

  pages={3677-3689},
  abstract={The computer-aided system and chest X-ray images play an important role in the diagnosis of pneumonia, which are the main way of pneumonia diagnosis. The traditional deep learning models have achieved some success in medical images, which captures the potential features of the image by continuously sliding the fixed convolution kernel. The disadvantage of this method is that it cannot effectively capture the long-distance dependencies in the image, and it does not have the ability of dynamic adaptive modeling. Next, the high-quality labeled data of chest X-ray images are very scarce. In order to achieve high-quality artificial intelligence diagnosis, a large number of high-quality annotated chest X-ray images are required. In this work, based on technologies such as Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and Digital Twins, we built an intelligent IoMT platform for automatic diagnosis of pneumonia. For the digital twin of the lung, we propose an enhanced vision transformer model (EVTM) for analyzing chest X-ray images to determine whether the patient is infected with pneumonia. The EVTM model utilizes the vision transformer for training and inference on chest X-ray images. Then the EVTM model uses the variational autoencoder model for data augmentation, so that the amount of chest X-ray images meets the training requirements of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on the standard chest X-ray image dataset to verify the effectiveness of the EVTM model.},

  pages={3056-3069},
  abstract={With the interdisciplinary advances of mobile communication and edge computing, massive heterogeneous tasks are accessing wireless networks and competing for the edge-end computing and communication resources. Digital twin (DT), which establishes the digital models of physical objects for simulation, analysis and optimization, provides a promising method for network scheduling and management. This paper proposes a DT-driven edge-end collaborative scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous tasks and heterogeneous computing/communication resources. Specifically, multiple end devices (EDs) cooperate with each other to accomplish a complex job, where each ED can offload individual task to multiple edge servers (ESs) for parallel computing. By fully considering deadline requirements of heterogeneous tasks, maximum computing capabilities of ESs and EDs, computing resource estimation deviations of DT, maximum transmit powers of EDs and tolerable peak interference powers to coexisting EDs, we formulate a job completion time minimization problem to jointly optimize the edge-end task division, transmit power control, computing resource type matching and allocation. To solve this non-convex problem, we first reformulate it by multi-agent Markov decision process, where a compound reward leveraging latency reward and deadline reward according to the task criticality is designed. Then, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based scheduling algorithm, where Actor-Critic framework with estimation and target networks is designed for policy and value iterations. Meanwhile, a step-by-step  $\epsilon $ -greedy algorithm is proposed to balance exploration and exploitation, avoiding local optimal trap. Through offline centralized training by DT and online distributed execution by EDs, we realize edge-end collaborative computing for heterogeneous tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, comparing with typical benchmark algorithms, the proposed algorithm converges with the highest reward and achieves the smallest job completion time, where the deadlines of heterogeneous tasks can be well satisfied respectively.},

  abstract={To meet the future demands for ubiquitous communication coverage and temporary / unexpected computing resources, aerial computing networks have been envisioned as a new paradigm. Nevertheless, dynamic changes on the network make it particularly challenging to achieve global optimal resource allocation. As an emerging technology, digital twin (DT) can represent real objects in physical network by creating virtual models. With the help of DT, we can easily obtain comprehensive real-world high-fidelity state information for model training, so as to achieve intelligent efficient decision-making. Accordingly, DT-based aerial computing networks have emerged as a potential solution. Note that available researches mostly assumed simple ground user distribution like uniform distribution, and adopted binary / partial offloading in task processing, neglecting the task separability and data inter-dependency among subtasks. Toward this end, we introduce DT into aerial computing networks, and study the problem of intelligent UAV deployment and resource allocation. Specifically, we firstly propose a DT-assisted UAV deployment strategy and model the data inter-dependency among subtasks. After that, two DT-assisted hybrid (binary and partial) task offloading schemes are presented, i.e., heuristic greedy and DQN-based schemes. Extensive analysis and numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed DT-assisted UAV deployment and hybrid task offloading strategies.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT)-assisted mobile edge network can achieve energy-efficient task offloading by optimizing the decision-making in real time. Although many DT-assisted task offloading solutions in mobile edge networks have been designed, stochastic asynchronizations between the DTs and physical entities are still ignored. In this paper, we investigate a task offloading problem in a DT-assisted URLLC-enabled mobile edge network which considered the uncertain deviation between DT estimated values and physical actual values. Specifically, we formulate a latency and energy consumption minimization problem by optimizing task offloading, resource allocation, and power management. To solve this problem, we propose a DT-assisted robust task offloading scheme (DTRTO) based on learning composed of decision and deviation networks. The deviation network predicts the worst-case deviations based on the pre-decision, and the decision network optimize the decision considered the worst-case deviation. The simulation results show that, compared to the baseline algorithms, the DTRTO scheme can realize low latency and energy consumption in task offloading while maintaining high robustness.},

  abstract={The purpose of malicious traffic detection and identification in the Internet of Things is to detect the intrusion of malicious traffic within the Internet of Things network into Internet of Things devices. Detection and identification play a key role in ensuring the security of the Internet of Things. At this time, great success has been achieved with deep learning in the field of malicious traffic detection and identification. However, due to resource limitations such as computation weaknesses and low edge network node storage capacity in the Internet of Things, a high-complexity model based on deep learning cannot be deployed and applied. In this paper, we propose a lightweight malicious traffic detection and recognition model named Lightweight Knowledge Distillation-Space Time Neural Network (LKD-STNN) based on knowledge distillation deep learning for the Internet of Things. We use knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model by depth-wise separable convolution and BiLSTM to realize a lightweight student model and obtain multidimensional characteristic information. According to the characteristics of knowledge distillation, we propose an adaptive temperature function that can adaptively and dynamically change the temperature during the process of knowledge transfer so that different softening characteristics can be obtained during the training process. Then, the weight is updated by combining loss functions to improve the performance of the student model. The experimental results show that with the publicly available malicious traffic datasets for the Internet of Things, the ToN-IoT and IoT-23, our model not only reduces the complexity of the model and the number of model parameters to less than 1% of the teacher model but also reaches an accuracy of more than 98%, indicating that our model can be applied to the multiclassification identification of malicious traffic in the Internet of Things.},

  abstract={Accurately detecting objects in 3D point clouds is critical for achieving precise scene understanding in autonomous driving systems. Cooperative perception, through information exchange among neighboring vehicles, can significantly improve object detection performance even under occlusion. This paper proposes a novel cooperative perception framework based on multi-teacher knowledge distillation for 3D object detection, namely MKD-Cooper. First, we design a Collaborative Attention Fusion (CAF) module that dynamically captures inter-vehicle interactions through channel and spatial attention. By incorporating the CAF module into the CAF network, we effectively aggregate shared deep learning-based features from neighboring vehicles, resulting in a fused feature map that contains rich contextual information. Second, we propose an adaptive multi-teacher knowledge distillation method that adaptively assigns weights to different teacher models based on their current performance, effectively transferring valuable knowledge from multiple excellent teacher models to the student model. Experimental results on the OPV2V and V2XSim 2.0 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in detection accuracy while exhibiting excellent comprehensive performance between detection accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, field experiments in real urban environments further validate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  pages={3590-3602},
  abstract={The rise of distributed cloud computing technologies has been pivotal for the large-scale adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based applications for high fidelity and scalable service delivery. Systematic resource management is central in maintaining optimal Quality of Service (QoS) in cloud platforms and is divided into three fundamental types: resource provisioning, AI model deployment and workload placement. To exploit the synergy among these decision types, it becomes imperative to concurrently design (co-design) the provisioning, deployment and placement decisions for optimal QoS. As users and cloud service providers shift to non-stationary AI-based workloads, frequent decision making imposes severe time constraints on the resource management models. Existing AI-based solutions often optimize decision types independently and tend to ignore the dependencies across various system performance aspects such as energy consumption and CPU utilization, making them perform poorly in large-scale cloud systems. To address this, we propose a novel method, called SciNet, that leverages a co-simulated digital-twin of the infrastructure to capture inter-metric dependencies and accurately estimate QoS scores. To avoid expensive simulation overheads at test time, SciNet trains a neural network based imitation learner that aims to mimic an oracle, which takes optimal decisions based on co-simulated QoS estimates. Offline model training and online decision making based on the imitation learner, enables SciNet to take optimal decisions while being time-efficient. Experiments with real-life AI-based benchmark applications on a public cloud testbed show that SciNet gives up to 48% lower execution cost, 79% higher inference accuracy, 71% lower energy consumption and 56% lower response times compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Mobile edge computing (MEC) enables various services to be cached in close proximity to the user equipments (UEs), thereby reducing the service delay of many emerging applications. However, the limitation of storage, computation, and radio resources, the dynamics of the decentralized MEC environment, and the complex spatial relationships of service request types and wireless network states between edge nodes make it difficult to realize efficient edge computing services. To address these challenges, this paper integrates the digital twin (DT) technology with a multi-cell MEC network to study an intelligent cooperative task offloading and service caching scheme, aiming at maximizing a quality of services (QoE)-based system utility. Specifically, we first construct a digital twin edge network (DITEN) to reflect the physical MEC system in real-time and provide data for training. With the help of DT technology, it is easy to access data resources in the DITEN to improve the simulation ability and reduce the communication cost. Then, we propose a graph attention-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (GatMARL) algorithm to learn the optimal task offloading and service caching strategies in the DITEN. The GatMARL employs a graph attention-based value decomposition network to capture the potential spatial relationships between edge nodes to learn better attentive cooperation policy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GatMARL algorithm exhibits an effective performance improvement compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT), Digital Twin (DT), and Federated Learning (FL) are redefining the future vision of globalization. While IoT is about sensing data from physical devices, DTs reflect their digital representation and enable optimized decision-making by tightly integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although swiftly growing, DTs are raising new challenges in privacy concerns, which are nowadays addressed by FL. However, the limited IoT resources, the communication overhead, and the lack of trust among clients are major obstacles that hinder the effectiveness of learning systems. In this paper, we design a new IoT-based architecture empowered by DT to improve the efficiencies of limited-resources devices. On top of this architecture, we leverage FL to construct the DT models. We further propose CISCO-FL, a Clustered FL with Intelligent Selection and Computation Offloading. Particularly, we study the computing resources of the clients and the quality of their models, and we embed in the proposed approach an intelligent offloading model, where the clients with high computational resources can assist and optimize the model of those struggling with limited resources. As such, both communication cost and computation resources are reduced and optimized. Finally, thorough experimental results are presented to support our findings and validate our model.},

  abstract={Due to the lack of sufficient labeled data, semi-supervised learning is an effective scheme to boost the performance of retinal disease classification. However, traditional semi-supervised methods are restricted by the strong assumption that the labeled and unlabeled images share the same distribution. In practice, labeled and unlabeled retinal images may have different style domains (e.g. different cameras) or semantic domains (e.g. different diseases). In this paper, an out-of-distribution (OOD) semi-supervised learning method is proposed for retinal disease classification based on knowledge distillation with a teacher-student architecture. To extract the information of the OOD unlabeled images, our method leverages the consistency constrains of both spatial feature representation and the probability learned from teacher model and student model. The performance and generalization of the proposed method are evaluated on the public databases including Messidor, REFUGE and iChallenge-AMD. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing semi-supervised methods.},

  abstract={Brain tumor segmentation based on multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a pivotal role in assisting brain cancer diagnosis, treatment, and postoperative evaluations. Despite the achieved inspiring performance by existing automatic segmentation methods, multi-modal MRI data are still unavailable in real-world clinical applications due to quite a few uncontrollable factors(e.g. different imaging protocols, data corruption, and patient condition limitations), which lead to a large performance drop during practical applications. In this work, we propose a Deeply supervIsed knowledGE tranSfer neTwork (DIGEST), which achieves accurate brain tumor segmentation under different modality-missing scenarios. Specifically, a knowledge transfer learning frame is constructed, enabling a student model to learn modality-shared semantic information from a teacher model pretrained with the complete multi-modal MRI data. To simulate all the possible modality-missing conditions under the given multi-modal data, we generate incomplete multi-modal MRI samples based on Bernoulli sampling. Finally, a deeply supervised knowledge transfer loss is designed to ensure the consistency of the teacher-student structure at different decoding stages, which helps the extraction of inherent and effective modality representations. Experiments on the BraTS 2020 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves promising results for the incomplete multi-modal MR image segmentation task.},

  abstract={Prognosis and health management (PHM) of Control moment gyroscope (CMG) plays a crucial role in ensuring the operational efficiency and safety of spacecraft. In order to improve the accuracy of PHM and supplement abundant monitoring data, this paper proposes a digital twin-driven degradation modeling method, which establishes a detailed simulation model based on degradation mechanisms at the CMG component level. The digital twin model not only provides a large amount of high-quality data for performance evaluation, but also serves as an important reference for on-orbit CMG state assessment. Finally, a case of estimating virtual sensor degradation information based on reinforcement learning is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed digital twin method.},

  year={2023},
  volume={20},
  number={8},
  pages={177-197},
  abstract={Digital twins for wide-areas (DT-WA) can model and predict the physical world with high fidelity by incorporating an artificial intelligence (AI) model. However, the AI model requires an energy-consuming updating process to keep pace with the dynamic environment, where studies are still in infancy. To reduce the updating energy, this paper proposes a distributed edge cooperation and data collection scheme. The AI model is partitioned into multiple sub-models deployed on different edge servers (ESs) co-located with access points across wide-area, to update distributively using local sensor data. To reduce the updating energy, ESs can choose to become either updating helpers or recipients of their neighboring ESs, based on sensor quantities and basic updating convergencies. Helpers would share their updated sub-model parameters with neighboring recipients, so as to reduce the latter updating workload. To minimize system energy under updating convergency and latency constraints, we further propose an algorithm to let ESs distributively optimize their cooperation identities, collect sensor data, and allocate wireless and computing resources. It comprises several constraint-release approaches, where two child optimization problems are solved, and designs a large-scale multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation shows that the proposed scheme can efficiently reduce updating energy compared with the baselines.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT), referring to a promising technique to digitally and accurately represent actual physical entities, has attracted explosive interests from both academia and industry. One typical advantage of DT is that it can be used to not only virtually replicate a system’s detailed operations but also analyze the current condition, predict the future behavior, and refine the control optimization. Although DT has been widely implemented in various fields, such as smart manufacturing and transportation, its conventional paradigm is limited to embody non-living entities, e.g., robots and vehicles. When adopted in human-centric systems, a novel concept, called human digital twin (HDT) has thus been proposed. Particularly, HDT allows in silico representation of individual human body with the ability to dynamically reflect molecular status, physiological status, emotional and psychological status, as well as lifestyle evolutions. These prompt the expected application of HDT in personalized healthcare (PH), which can facilitate the remote monitoring, diagnosis, prescription, surgery and rehabilitation, and hence significantly alleviate the heavy burden on the traditional healthcare system. However, despite the large potential, HDT faces substantial research challenges in different aspects, and becomes an increasingly popular topic recently. In this survey, with a specific focus on the networking architecture and key technologies for HDT in PH applications, we first discuss the differences between HDT and the conventional DTs, followed by the universal framework and essential functions of HDT. We then analyze its design requirements and challenges in PH applications. After that, we provide an overview of the networking architecture of HDT, including data acquisition layer, data communication layer, computation layer, data management layer and data analysis and decision making layer. Besides reviewing the key technologies for implementing such networking architecture in detail, we conclude this survey by presenting future research directions of HDT.},

  title={Viewpoint Planning of Robotic Measurement System for Free-Form Surfaces Based on Visibility Cone Space Explorer}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-15},
  abstract={Free-form surfaces have been widely used in industrial design and manufacturing. For the requirements of measurement efficiency and precision, robots and optical scanners are applied to measure free-form surface parts increasingly. Due to the complex geometry shapes and occlusions of these parts, how to plan accessible viewpoints of a scanner to achieve the expected coverage rate is a challenging task. This paper presents a novel viewpoint planning method based on the visibility cone space explorer (VP-VCSE) for robotic measurement systems with 7 degrees of freedom (7-DOF). A digital twin for the robotic measurement system is implemented to provide core services for robotic measurement tasks, including sensor simulation and collision detection. To generate initial candidate viewpoints, a novel mesh segmentation algorithm based on the hybrid mixture model is proposed, which is convenient to handle the triangular mesh of the target object. Visibility computation for a target object in given viewpoints is the key to dealing with the occlusion problem. For this purpose, a general visibility model of a structured-light scanner is presented to compute visible areas accurately. In order to reduce occlusions, a visibility cone space explorer is designed to search optimal candidate viewpoints considering inverse kinematics and physical collisions simultaneously. The viewpoint planning problem is formulated as a set covering optimization problem and a next-best-view operator is introduced to improve the efficiency of the genetic algorithm for searching the resultant viewpoint set, guaranteeing the expected coverage rate and data overlap rate. The simulation and experiment results for four different test models show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods in terms of the uncovered rate and the minimum number of viewpoints. Note to Practitioners—This paper addressed a viewpoint planning problem for the robotic measurement system with a binocular structured light 3D scanner mounted on the end effector of the robot, where a robot and a turntable cooperate to complete the measurement tasks. The goal is to find a minimal number of viewpoints that provides full coverage of the target surfaces. Although many studies have addressed this problem, there is little discussion about strategies to improve coverage rate when the target object has complex occlusions. This paper suggested a valuable practice to construct a visibility cone space to adjust viewpoint to reduce occlusions and improve the overall coverage rate. Simulation and experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. This paper showed how to deal with various constraints that a feasible viewpoint needs to satisfy in the viewpoint generation, viewpoint adjustment, and viewpoint selection phase. Moreover, this paper provided a solution for developing the visualization, simulation, and interaction of a digital twin for the 7-DOF robotic measurement system. All core services for robotic measurement tasks are implemented based on a set of open source libraries, which provides a convenient learning and research software platform for practitioners. In future research, we will study how to improve the intelligence and cooperation of the robotic measurement system through deep learning or reinforcement learning techniques.},

  abstract={The industrial Internet of Things (IoT) system is integrated with the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms to empower industrial automation and self-evolving capabilities. AI-driven resource allocation across cyber-physical domains for mobile industrial IoT must consider its fundamental requirements and key characteristics such as high reliability, low latency, and environmental dynamics. The challenge is twofold. Industrial systems are fault-sensitive, which makes them intolerable of trial-and-error-based learning and optimization approaches. In addition, learning models cannot adapt to changing industrial IoT environment with dynamic communication noise and machinery disturbances. In this paper, we propose joint optimization for the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and multi-tier hybrid cloud-edge computing empowered industrial IoT that results in improved utilization of communication and computing resources. Second, we establish the fine-grained digital twin for industrial IoT (DT-IIoT) to simulate the changing industrial environment to support trial-and-error-based safe learning. Third, we leverage meta reinforcement learning (meta RL) to improve the generalization and fast adaptation of the learning models for DT-IIoT. Finally, the feasibility and efficiency of these schemes are evaluated through extensive experiments.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT) is becoming a promising solution for vehicular networks to improve the interoperability of distributed autonomous driving systems. Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been introduced to provide low-latency services for DT-enabled vehicular networks at the edge of the network. However, it is hard to obtain the dynamic network topology for moving vehicles by the ground-based MEC system, which may deteriorate the service quality for DT synchronization. In this paper, we propose a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted synchronization framework for DT-enabled vehicular networks. With the proposed framework, an intelligent resource allocation algorithm is developed to improve UAV resource utilization and maximize the synchronization completion ratio. By leveraging an advantage actor-critic (A2C) algorithm, the synchronization decisions are obtained with low time complexity. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the synchronization latency and improve the synchronization completion ratio effectively.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={In this paper, we design a 3D map management scheme for edge-assisted mobile augmented reality (MAR) to support the pose estimation of individual MAR device, which uploads camera frames to an edge server. Our objective is to minimize the pose estimation uncertainty of the MAR device by periodically selecting a proper set of camera frames for uploading to update the 3D map. To address the challenges of the dynamic uplink data rate and the time-varying pose of the MAR device, we propose a digital twin (DT)-based approach to 3D map management. First, a DT is created for the MAR device, which emulates 3D map management based on predicting subsequent camera frames. Second, a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithm is developed, utilizing the data collected from both the actual and the emulated data to manage the 3D map. With extensive emulated data provided by the DT, the MBRL algorithm can quickly provide an adaptive map management policy in a highly dynamic environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DT-based 3D map management outperforms benchmark schemes by achieving lower pose estimation uncertainty and higher data efficiency in dynamic environments.},

  abstract={The Digital twin based Healthcare System is a demanding issue that can introduce improvements in the life of the elderly and disabled people living in remote places. More recently, modern Digital twin based Healthcare Systems have gained more attention and invitations from people due to the popularity of smart city establishment along with improvements in various healthcare services adapted in the smart phones. It is achievable because of the anytime, anywhere service access mechanism and machine-learning-based smart predictions over the cloud computing platform. The existing Healthcare System offers service to remote patients through continuous monitoring and tracking of physiological health records without live interaction and portability. Thus, the Digital twin based Healthcare System (DTHS) is proposed with smart virtual care facilities to enhance the earlier states of disease prediction and a patient-centric diagnosis mechanism from remote locations. Particularly, diseases such as Parkinson disease, identified as a severe neuro degenerative disorder worldwide, require such prediction and diagnosis at earlier stages. In this work, the experiments are focusing two voice based data sets namely DS1, and DS2 obtained from Kaggle, and UCI Machine learning repository. The proposed DTHS is developed over the cloud platform for Parkinson disease prediction using the Optimized Fuzzy based k-Nearest Neighbour (OF-k-NN) classifier model. It provides cumulative improvements against the existing Neural Network and Kernel-based SVM classifiers with respect to Prediction Time for DS1 as 0.00127 seconds, and DS2 as 0.00105 seconds, Prediction Accuracy for DS1 as 97.95%, and DS2 received 91.48%, F1-Score 0.98 for DS1, and 0.91 for DS2, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of DS1 got 0.93675, and DS2 received 0.79816.},

  abstract={New industrial paradigms, such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industry 5.0, are emerging in industrial contexts with the aim of fostering quality in operational processes. With the expected launch of 6G in the coming years, IIoT networks in Industry 5.0 ecosystems can leverage 6G technology and its support for training machine learning models using Digital Twins (DTs), embedded in DT Networks (DTNs), to transparently and continuously optimize their communications. Unfortunately, the use of these technologies, in turn, intensifies the attack surface and poses a serious threat to the new goals of Industry 5.0, such as improving the user experience, sustainability and resilience. This article therefore proposes a layered protection framework for 6G-enabled IIoT environments, where not only DTs and DTNs are fully protected, but also the whole 6G ecosystem, complying with the expected goals of Industry 5.0. To achieve this, the framework identifies for each protection layer a set of security and privacy services to subsequently relate them to existing computing infrastructures (cloud, edge, edge-cloud) and provide the best approach for future IIoT deployments.},

  abstract={Future wireless networks beyond the fifth generation (5G) have been envisioned to increase many folds, in terms of key performance metrics such as latency, data rate, reliability, mobility, and user's quality of experience. However, one of the biggest difference between the sixth generation (6G) and its predecessor is the ability to support high speed connectivity of mobile services for global coverage, especially focusing on under-connected areas (e.g., forests, oceans, deserts, and mountains). Integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs) provide the best solution to unravel the unconnected issues of isolated areas not only on the ground but also in the air and on the sea. Despite this premise, the research in ISTNs is still in its infancy with many open problems, associated with long delay communications, large coverage for massive number of devices, and highly demanding real-time services. To alleviate these problems, this article introduces optimal multi-beam design empowered by machine learning techniques for 6G ISTNs, with respect to the real-time constraints of mission-critical services. First, we give an overview of the multibeam design for 6G ISTNs with user clustering approaches, energy-efficiency radio resource allocation, and distributed computing. Then, the frameworks for intelligent multibeam based on machine learning, real-time optimisation, and game theory, are proposed. As case studies, we investigate the performance of machine learning-aided real-time optimisation for 6G ISTNs in disaster relief and real-time optimal multibeam in satellite-terrestrial IoT networks. Potential research directions incorporating digital twin and quantum-inspired optimisation are presented to further support optimal multibeam design in 6G ISTNs.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) has brought new promises of efficiency in our daily lives by integrating AI with the IoT. However, owing to limited resources (e.g., computational power), it is difficult to implement modern technology (e.g., AI) and improve its performance (i.e., the IoT). Moreover, cyberthreats and privacy challenges can hinder the success of the IoT. This situation is aggravated by network scarcity (i.e., limited network connectivity). This article presents a digital twin-based data aggregation scheme in which data are collected using federated learning by operating a drone and stored securely in the blockchain. Before data sharing, differential privacy is realized to enhance privacy. A multirole training scheme is proposed, along with a duplex model verification architecture using a Hampel filter and performance check. To validate the specifications, an authentication scheme was implemented by combining a cuckoo filter and timeframe check. A case study to construct an experimental environment using real hardware is discussed. Different experiments were conducted in this environment and the feasibility of the proposed scheme was validated from the outcomes.},

  abstract={Human activity recognition is crucial for tactile internet, virtual reality, and digital-twin applications. Previous works have analyzed machine learning for this purpose but often need to pay more attention to typical challenges when deploying these machine learning models in production. First, data must be transmitted to the network node on which the machine-learning model is running. However, scaling human activity recognition by the number of devices and users puts additional constraints on the available transmission channel. While transmitting less data saves bandwidth, removing redundant information from the data can also benefit machine learning. This paper addresses the problem of transmitting wearable sensor data for human activity recognition. To this end, we analyze the extent to which wearable sensor data can be compressed via sparse coding without sacrificing loss in recognition performance. We empirically illustrate, on various datasets, that only a fraction of sensor information is relevant for human activity recognition.},

  abstract={Deep learning techniques are widely used for land cover classification in remote sensing, primarily because they can effectively extract complex features from imagery data, which is essential for accurate land cover classification. However, the heterogeneity of data can pose a challenge to the generalizability of deep models. To address this issue, we propose a novel transfer learning framework for land cover classification using teacher-student structure. The proposed framework utilizes the knowledge acquired by the teacher model from large datasets to facilitate fine-tuning of the student model on small datasets, which prevents problems such as overfitting resulting from training large models on small datasets and inferior performance arising from the limited learning capacity of small models. To achieve this goal, we design a loss function base on central moment discrepancy and high-temperature softmax. In addition, we conducted experiments on three distinct pairs of datasets and found that our proposed framework outperforms both training the student model from scratch on the target domain and simply fine-tuning the teacher and student models from the source domain to the target domain. Specifically, we observed an average increase in mIoU of 9.9%, 2.1%, and 4.3%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed framework for remote sensing land cover classification.},

In this paper, a digital twin of a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar is used to detect a number of CAD replicas of various UAVs, and enable their simultaneous classification. Rather than resorting to complex measurement campaigns, a full-wave electromagnetic CAD tool was used to generate the digital twins, and the radar datasets which are then fed into machine learning classifiers.

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-15},
  abstract={This article explores the optimal offloading strategy in the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), which is challenged by three issues. First, the resources of edge servers are shared by multiple vehicles, leading to random changes over time. Second, as a vehicle would drive across consecutive edge servers, the offloading strategy needs to consider the overall edge resources along the trip. Third, at each vehicle, the computing tasks arrive continuously when driving. This dictates the offloading strategy to consider not only the current status but also the futuristic computing tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a digital twin (DT) network framework. A DT network maintains DTs in the cyber-space to synchronize the real-world activities of vehicles. Therefore, task offloading decisions can be benefited by combining both the global information aggregated from neighbor twins and historical information uploaded by vehicles. With comprehensive information, the optimal offloading strategy can be determined. We characterize the offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop an A3C-based decision-making algorithm, which can learn optimal offloading actions that minimize the long-term system costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the performance of our proposal in terms of fast convergence and low system costs when compared with other approaches.},

  pages={99413-99425},
  abstract={Precise and robust image segmentation is one of the most important steps in supervised deep learning-applied studies. Especially in the medical field, image segmentation requires an enormous time and professionals with clinical knowledge. Although there are constant attempts for automatic and semi-automatic image segmentation algorithm development, acquiring not only clinically accurate but also precise pixel-level annotations for medical images remains insufficient. This article presents a semi-supervised learning method with a novel fact-forcing process, referred to as FFSS, to reduce the labeling cost while improving the prediction accuracy for medical image segmentation. FFSS includes two components: a pre-trained teacher and a student that would be trained, iteratively. In each iteration, the teacher first generates a pseudo-label for each image in an unlabeled set, the student is then trained on the pseudo-labeled set and sends feedback to update the teacher. A fact-forcing process is designed to improve the quality of the student model using a labeled set. We have comprehensively evaluated our method on both three-dimensional binary segmentation and two-dimensional multi-class segmentation. The evaluation results demonstrate significant accuracy improvements of FFSS compared with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. Due to the fact-forcing process, the proposed method consistently outperforms the other ones under various labeled data ratios for all benchmark datasets, including left atrium MRI, pancreas CT, ACDC MRI, and OCT. By refining the quality of student feedback with complementary supervised training, the proposed FFSS shows robustness under labeled data scarcity for diverse types of medical images.},

  abstract={Deep learning (DL) models for 3D object detection from point clouds have shown remarkable progress in various autonomous perception scenarios. However, the issue of catastrophic forgetting seriously hinders the deployment of these models in real-world applications where new classes are encountered over time. In order to address this issue, we present the Contrastive Co-Teaching Network (COCO-TEACH) framework for class-incremental 3D object detection. Our proposed framework consists of two teacher networks: a primary teacher network that detects old class objects in new data and provides them with pseudo-labels and an auxiliary teacher network that leverages the unlabelled objects in new data. The two teacher models transfer their learned knowledge to the target student model through a class-aware consistency loss. To enhance this transfer, a supervised contrastive loss is further incorporated into the loss function. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method against baseline methods through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets. The results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on incremental 3D object detection.},

The teacher learns to generate curriculum to feed into the student model for data augmentation and guides the student to improve performance in a meta-learning style. In contrast to the generator and discriminator in GAN, which compete with each other, the teacher and student collaborate to improve the student's performance on the target tasks.

  abstract={In computer vision, considerable success has been achieved in image classification. Yet, real-world applications can be negatively affected by noise corruption, so a method for dealing with noise is crucial. Knowledge distillation that utilizes the knowledge of a teacher model trained on clean images to train a student model on noisy images is a promising technique because it can be applied without special modification of the classifier. However, clean images are typically not available for most practical uses. To address this issue, we proposed a novel knowledge distillation method without clean images. By leveraging a property of the feature extractor in the classifier that naturally removes unrelated features for classification, we perform a simple training of the teacher model on noisy images, under the assumption that such a teacher can provide pseudo-clean features. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve classification performance comparable to conventional methods, even without clean images.},

  abstract={With the development of commercial off-the-shelf hardware, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are promising to provide flexible edge computing services. In this paper, we investigate a digital twin (DT)-empowered satellite-terrestrial cooperative edge computing network, where computation tasks from terrestrial users can be partially offloaded to the associated base station (BS) edge server, the associated LEO satellite edge server, and an adjacent LEO satellite edge server. We formulate a multi-tier computation offloading optimization problem to minimize the weighted sum of total system delay and satellite energy consumption, where a LEO-layer problem and a DT-layer problem are involved. The LEO-layer problem optimizes the three-tier computation resource allocation and task splitting ratio. From the multi-satellite network perspective, the DT-layer problem optimizes how many resources will be shared between adjacent satellites. We then propose a multi-agent double actors twin delayed deterministic policy gradient (MA-DATD3) algorithm to optimize the LEO-layer problem, and adopt a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm. The proposed MA-DATD3 algorithm is extended to solve the DT-layer problem in a centralized way, and the resource sharing between adjacent satellites is optimized to maximize the time-averaged reward. Simulation results show that our algorithm achieves a better performance than the MADDPG algorithm, and effectively improves the computation offloading performance while balancing the energy consumption and the total delay.},

  abstract={In recent years, we have seen the success of deep video enhancement models. However, the performance improvement of new methods has gradually entered a bottleneck period. Optimizing model structures or increasing training data brings less and less improvement. We argue that existing models with advanced structures have not fully demonstrated their performance and demand further exploration. In this study, we statistically analyze the relationship between motion estimation accuracy and video interpolation quality of existing video frame interpolation methods, and find that only supervising the final output leads to inaccurate motion and further affects the interpolation performance. Based on this important observation, we propose a general motion distillation framework that can be widely applied to flow-based and kernel-based video frame interpolation methods. Specifically, we begin by training a teacher model, which uses the ground-truth target frame and adjacent frames to estimate motion. These motion estimates then guide the training of a student model for video frame interpolation. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing performance across diverse advanced video interpolation model structures. For example, after applying our motion distillation framework, the CtxSyn model achieves a PSNR gain of 3.047dB.},

  abstract={An interactive scientific simulation and visualization pipeline in mixed reality was developed to explore how scientific simulation could proceed in coming workplace. The main technical concern is fast scientific simulator and visualizer in mixed reality with hand gesture. Framework for scientific simulation and visualization was implemented on the server side based on deep learning based fast simulation model and open source visualization toolkit, VTK, respectively. Airfoil aerodynamics was selected as a target scientific simulation task since it is a representative and critical problem in scientific fluid simulation determining the whole aero-product’s performance and shows highly nonlinear physics even by small shape deviation and so high computational cost. Therefore, the fast simulator was firstly developed by carefully developing convolutional neural network-based model, using U-net, which learned corresponding high accuracy simulation dataset. All scenes which are supposed to be seen on the mobile device side were authored in a widely used content development tool called Unity3D with a mixed reality toolkit, MRTK for Microsoft Hololens 2. User interface and user experience were created based on a scenario of a drone rotor which demonstrates running and analyzing the simulation results using designed interaction gestures. Finally, several discussions were derived through the implemented digital twin pipeline. It was concluded, with an adequately implemented mixed reality tools, that scientific researchers or industrial engineers will be helped not only in individual analysis works due to the delicacy of hands and fingers and real time interaction in mixed reality, but also, as a future study, in cooperative analysis works.},

  abstract={With the continuous development of information technologies, the digital twin has become one of the hot spots in recent years. In a digital twin system, the mathematical model of the control plant is mostly obtained from the derivation and computation of the mechanism model in the current remote virtual simulation. But in physical systems, the parameters primarily depend on the state of the system. A mathematical model for a physical system with time-varying characteristics is therefore inappropriate. Simultaneously, based on online identification and prediction, experiments were developed to carry out interdisciplinary comprehensive experimental education and conform with the growth of the engineering disciplines. In this paper, an online DT-based DC motor system is present. A five-dimension model of the DT system is designed and implemented with the physical DC motor system, DT 3D model, mathematical model, real-time data, and the online DT platform. The model parameters can be calculated and the future state can be predicted using the online identification and prediction method. Experiments show the stability of the DT architecture. The DT-predicted output can be consistent with the physical device output. Additionally, under certain circumstances, DT systems can take the place of the physical data in order to maintain the system's functionality.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation is a hot research topic in the field of deep learning model compression. Knowledge distillation aims to transfer knowledge from a larger and optimised teacher network to a smaller learnable network and is important for improving the accuracy of student models. Existing KD methods typically consider privileged information about the similarity/consistency between the class distribution or intermediate feature representations of the teacher and student models. However directly driving the student model to simulate the features of the teacher model largely ignores the knowledge/features that are not found in the student model learning the teacher model. In this paper we propose a new inter-channel correlation framework for knowledge extraction (IE-ICKD) that divides the student model into two parts, inheritance and exploration, where the inheritance part has transferred existing learning knowledge from the teacher model to the student model by simulating the feature space of the teacher model, while the exploration part is assigned to learn the feature space not learned by the simulated teacher model. Extensive experiments have shown that our proposed model enables better performance of the student model on the CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10 datasets, and it outperforms many existing methods. We achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 74.12% by choosing ResNet110 as the teacher and ResNet32 as the student, which is very close to the 74.31% of the teacher model, achieving distillation and demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) in Healthcare 4.0 (H4.0) presents a digital model of the patient with all its biological properties and characteristics. One of the application areas is patient respiration monitoring for enhanced patient care and decision support to healthcare professionals. Obtrusive methods of patient monitoring create hindrances in the patient’s daily routine. This research presents a novel Respiration DT (ResDT) model based on Wi-Fi Carrier State Information (CSI), improved signal processing, and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for monitoring and classification (binary and multi-class) of patient respiration. A Wi-Fi sensor ESP32 with Wi-Fi CSI was utilized for the collection of respiration data. This provides an added advantage of unobtrusive monitoring of patient vital signs. The Patient’s Breaths Per Minute (BPM) is estimated from raw sensor data through the integration of multiple signal processing methodologies for denoising (smoothing and filtering) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, SVM, EMD, EMD-PCA). Multiple filters and dimensionality reduction methodologies are compared for accurate BPM estimation. The elliptical filter provides a relatively better estimation of the BPM with 87.5% accurate estimation as compared to other bandpass filters such as Butterworth (BF), Chebyshev type 1 Filter (CH1), Chebyshev type 2 Filter (CH2), and wavelet Decomposition (62.5%, 75%, 68.75%, and 75% respectively). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to provide better dimensionality reduction with 87.5% accurate BPM values compared to EMD, SVD, and EMD-PCA (57%, 44%, and 44% respectively). Additionally, the fine tree algorithm, from the implemented 21 ML supervised classification algorithms with K-fold cross-validation, was observed to be the optimal choice for multi-class and binary-class classification problems in the presented ResDT model with 96.9% and 95.8% accuracy respectively.},

  abstract={Chronic respiratory conditions are a major public health concern worldwide and pose a significant burden on individuals and healthcare systems. Early detection of pulmonary diseases play a major role in treatment. However, existing diagnostic techniques can be expensive, time-consuming, and require specialized expertise and any misdiagnosis can lead to delayed treatment. Lung auscultation is a widely used diagnostic technique that involves listening to respiratory sounds through a stethoscope which provide valuable information about the respiratory system and help in the identification of pulmonary diseases. However, interpretation of these sounds requires extensive training and experience. In this paper, we present the ”Pulmonet” system, which has been developed to identify pulmonary diseases by analyzing lung auscultation sounds. The methodology employed involves knowledge distillation, where valuable insights from a large and computationally intensive model (referred to as the teacher model) are transferred to a computationally efficient model (referred to as the student model). Our approach involves converting the respiratory sounds into Mel spectrogram images, which can be processed by our system. The model’s task is to make predictions about the presence of pulmonary diseases in a patient and identify the specific disease if any (such as Pneumonia, Upper Respiratory Tract Infection, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Bronchitis, Bronchiolitis) or classify them as healthy if no disease is detected. Following that, the insights acquired by the initial model are conveyed to the student model, which possesses lower computational complexity, making it feasible for deployment on mobile devices. Finding the suitable loss function for student model is crucial and challenging in our work. The loss function should be designed to balance both knowledge transfer and preservation of student model. In our work we have achieved the accuracy of 82% in teacher model and 78% in student model.},

  abstract={As a real-time representation of physical entities in the digital world, digital twin (DT) has been widely used in many industrial fields, which has brought remarkable efficiency improvement and cost reduction. With the evolution of 6G network, the requirements for ultra-low delay and intelligence are gradually improved, and digital twin edge network (DTEN) came into being. DTEN mainly collects real-time information of physical objects through edge nodes such as BSs and APs, and builds dynamic models on demand based on these information, which has the ability of description, diagnosis, prediction and decision-making. Aiming at the traffic management and resource allocation in DTEN, a QoE-driven wireless communication resource allocation method based on DTEN is proposed, and the overall architecture design of DTEN system is completed. By integrating DT and RL technologies, the DTEN system models can be self-improved and dynamically adjusted, and the datadriven resource allocation model can be updated efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm guarantees a high level of QoE for users. Compared with Q-Learning algorithm alone, the proposed algorithm can support more users’ access under the same congestion performance and reduce the iteration times of the algorithm by about 70%.},

  abstract={Remote sensing object labels require high specialization, resulting in a limited number of labeled samples. Without large labeled samples to support training, general remote sensing object recognition models have limited accuracy. Addressing this issue, this article proposes a weakly correlated distillation learning framework for remote sensing object recognition with a small number of samples. Benefitting from large-scale natural image datasets, many recognition models achieve superior feature extraction capabilities. Thus, we use them as backbones to build teacher models, and then fine-tune the teacher models with a small-scale remote sensing dataset. However, due to the limited number of remote sensing samples, the teacher models may produce noisy features that reduce the performance of the student model. Therefore, we propose a weakly correlated distillation method that selects the weakly correlated features from teacher models to distill the student. Since the weakly correlated features contain different noise distributions that can be mutually suppressed, thereby improving the performance of the student. Extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets of DOTA, HRRSD, and NWPU VHR-10 demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with the state of the arts (SOTA).

  abstract={Manufacturing and industrial engineering education has encountered several challenges in addressing the educational demands of rapidly advancing technologies such as Industry 4.0, virtual reality (VR), digital twin (DT), etc. On the one hand, conventional laboratory facilities are unable to cope with this demand due to their nature of isolated operations. On the other, there is also a need to expose the students to concepts like Industry 4.0 and DT, where a virtual replica of the physical system is created and connected in real time. Therefore, this study aimed to establish DT connectivity between the physical and digital models of a conveyor available in a manufacturing system in a learning factory (LF). The integration of existing hardware with a simulated platform, utilizing an IoT-enabled environment and operating the hardware through VR setups, enabled seamless interaction between the physical and virtual realms, enhancing control, visualization, and optimization of hardware systems. Moreover, in addition to facilitating the DT, a VR platform has been integrated with the digital model of the conveyor system, enabling control of the physical system through a VR setup. The positioning accuracy of the conveyor carried pallet was tested for several locations, and results revealed that the digital model indicates the pallet position to the accuracy level of the nearest 2.5 mm. Furthermore, it could be concluded that the setup developed in this research could be used as an LF for engineering undergraduates to learn new concepts such as Industry 4.0, DT, and VR-enabled digital-physical integration.},

Analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and simultaneously PPG analysis is the prime research motive in clinical data processing. The valuation flow of diagnostic values for these bio signals mostly depends on quantity, accuracy, precision, speed, and real time signal evaluation useful for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Peak parameters of ECG signals like Heart rate (HR), Heart rate variability (HRV), Heart rate turbulence (HRT), T – wave alternans (TWA), Pulse rate (PR), Pulse rate variability (PRV), Pulse rate turbulence (PRT), Pulse transit time (PTT) are extracted using peak detection algorithm. They provide useful information about the cardiac vascular parameters. In this paper we have introduced a method for analysis of ECG signals in the mode of Peak detection. This method provides an excellent online diagnose pattern for cardiovascular diseases like myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest. By the fact that ECG signals shows a peak detected. The evaluated parameters both in Time and Frequency domain provide an accurate evaluation of the disorders. The machine learning algorithm for efficient power consumption is analyzed. Comparison of different kernels of Support Vector Machine (SVM) with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is also handled. The cloud-based analysis can be handled efficiently with the linear classifier such as SVM kernels and KNN classifiers. Comparing the performance metrics between the SVM kernels the Laplace RBF has more accuracy and precision than the other kernels. The KNN classifier is more precise and accurate compared with other classifiers.

  abstract={This article introduces the application of the improved K-means clustering algorithm in vocational Chinese education. Vocational Chinese language education is an important link in cultivating professional abilities and comprehensive qualities, and effective teaching methods and personalized teaching strategies play an important role in improving students' Chinese language proficiency. The application of integrated machine learning algorithms can help teachers better understand the learning characteristics and needs of students, thus conducting targeted teaching.Firstly, this article introduces the significance and goals of vocational Chinese language education. The Chinese language education in vocational colleges should not only cultivate students' language expression and communication skills, but also focus on cultivating students' professional literacy and comprehensive thinking abilities. Therefore, personalized teaching and precise learning evaluation are important directions for vocational Chinese education.Secondly, this article explores the application of the improved K-means clustering algorithm in vocational Chinese education. The traditional K-means clustering algorithm only considers the distance and similarity between samples, but in vocational Chinese education, it also needs to consider factors such as students' learning characteristics and background. Therefore, this article proposes an improved K-means algorithm that incorporates students' learning characteristics and needs as additional information into the clustering process, thereby achieving more accurate student grouping and personalized teaching.Then, this article introduces the practical application of the improved K-means algorithm in vocational Chinese education. By collecting and analyzing students' learning data and personal information, a student model is established, and an improved K-means algorithm is used to divide students into different groups. Teachers can develop corresponding teaching plans and personalized teaching strategies based on the learning characteristics and needs of different groups, to improve teaching effectiveness and student satisfaction.Finally, this article summarizes the application value of the improved K-means clustering algorithm in vocational Chinese education. By applying the improved K-means algorithm, teachers can better understand students' learning characteristics and needs, provide personalized teaching and learning support, and help improve students' language proficiency and comprehensive quality.},

  pages={1106-1111},
  abstract={Time series forecasting has been an active research area, particularly in the context of Digital Twin (DT) systems. Despite the excellent results yielded by pre-trained models in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), only a few studies have researched pre-training strategies for time series forecasting networks within DT systems. Recent studies demonstrate that transfer learning across multiple time series datasets does not always provide promising results, making self-supervised pre-training directly on the downstream dataset a temporarily considered optimal solution. To the best of our knowledge, the only general pre-training task in the time series field is the Masked Autoencoder. However, this approach may lead to redundant representations for downstream forecasting within DT systems. Therefore, we propose three pre-training tasks specially designed for time series forecasting within DT frameworks: Inverse Forecasting (IF), Coarser Forecasting (CF), and Anomaly Forecasting (AF). These tasks are respectively designed to capture bidirectional dependency, reduce noise, and augment data, all crucial aspects in enhancing the predictive capabilities of DT systems. By integrating the three tasks, we obtain a composite pre-training task which generally improves the forecasting results of time series models within DT systems across multiple datasets. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy and efficiency of DT systems, paving the way for more robust and reliable digital representations of physical systems.},

For SSD recognition, the SSD data are often insufficient and labels are scarce, making it hard to train a supervised deep model. In this article, we proposed a novel few-shot SSD recognition method based on self-supervised contrastive learning (self-SCL), which can effectively learn data representation with unlabeled data in the pretraining stage and learn categories from a few labeled samples in the fine-tuning stage. In this method, we proposed an information-guided teacher–student (TS) pretrained model with min–max instances similarity (MMIS) regularization. In the pretraining stage, we utilized the multicrop mechanism to build a teacher encoder (TE) with multiview information and leveraged the TE to guide the student encoder (SE) with information. Meanwhile, the SE also provided the TE with “questions” during the update process, which the SE also shared updated information with the TE for further refinement. Specifically, we introduced MMIS to address the problem of ambiguity between intraclass and interclass distances in SSD data. During the fine-tuning phase, we fine-tuned the pretrained model obtained by teacher–student with min–max instance similarity (TSMMIS) with a few labeled data and tested the SSD recognition accuracy in four SSD datasets. As the experimental results indicate, our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on the four SSD datasets.},

  abstract={In the era of Industry 4.0, digital agriculture is developing very rapidly and has achieved considerable results. Nowadays, digital agriculture-based research is more focused on the use of robotic fruit picking technology, and the main research direction of such topics is algorithms for computer vision. However, when computer vision algorithms successfully locate the target object, it is still necessary to use robotic arm movement to reach the object at the physical level, but such path planning has received minimal attention. Based on this research deficiency, we propose to use Unity software as a digital twin platform to plan the robotic arm path and use ML-Agent plug-in as a reinforcement learning means to train the robotic arm path, to improve the accuracy of the robotic arm to reach the fruit, and happily the effect of this method is much improved than the traditional method.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={30-35},
  abstract={The widespread deployment of the smart meters makes it possible to record massive fine-grained energy consumption data. However, the end energy users (e.g., prosumers) may tamper with their smart meters to mitigate the energy usage record fraudulently so as to reduce their payment, called energy theft. This behavior can result in poor energy management decision-making and economic losses for the power utilities. Therefore, it is pivotally important to take energy theft detection into consideration for ameliorating energy management. To this end, in this paper, an edge-assisted federated contrastive knowledge distillation (EFCKD) approach is proposed for energy management in terms of energy theft detection aspect towards a prosumer-based urban area, where gathering data in the power utility side is not required and the purpose is to achieve the average energy theft detection loss. Concretely, each client located on an edge server contains a local teacher model (LTM) and a local student model (LSM), where the LSM is a copy of the shared global student model (SGSM). The knowledge of each teacher network is distilled to teach the corresponding student network, while LSMs are collaboratively learned to update SGSM. In addition, model-contrastive learning is introduced to ameliorate performance. Experiments show that the proposed EFCKD outperforms the benchmarks since it can achieve the lowest average loss (0.0104).},

  abstract={Recent advances in sensing technologies, wireless communications and computing paradigms drive the evolution of vehicles toward intelligent and electronic consumer products. This paper investigates digital twins in vehicular edge computing (DT-VEC) via cooperative sensing and uploading of vehicles, aiming at achieving the quality-cost tradeoff in DT-VEC. First, a DT-VEC architecture is presented, and the digital twin system is modeled to reflect the real-time status of physical vehicular environments. Second, we derive the cooperative sensing model and the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) uploading model by considering the timeliness and consistency of the sensed information, and the redundancy, sensing cost and transmission cost of the system. On this basis, a bi-objective problem is formulated to maximize the system quality and minimize the system cost. Third, we propose a multi-agent multi-objective (MAMO) deep reinforcement learning model, including the design of distributed actors for storing replay experiences and a learner with a dueling critic network for agent action evaluation. Finally, we give comprehensive performance evaluation, which demonstrates that MAMO outperforms existing competitive solutions around 2∼5 times on maximizing system quality, while still saving system cost around 18%∼44%.},

  abstract={Autonomous system refers to a computer system that can operate independently, control itself and make decisions by itself. It does not rely on the support of external systems or software, and can complete various tasks and operations autonomously. Autonomous systems are often highly intelligent and adaptive in that they can acquire environmental information through sensors, analyze and process that information to make appropriate responses, and perform tasks without human intervention. Autonomous systems have a wide range of applications in artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, automated control and other fields, which can improve production efficiency, reduce costs, improve safety and reliability. However, most of the existing methods of autonomous systems are based on traditional machine learning or reinforcement learning. This paper proposes an algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to improve the learning efficiency of autonomous systems - LHU algorithm. The simulation dialogue experience is obtained from the interaction between autonomous systems and trainable user models. A posterior-session experience is the synthesis of successful session data by the posterior-module by acting on those failed session fragments and user goals. The dialogue experiences obtained from the user model and the posterior module provide more dialogue examples and positive feedback on dialogue strategy learning respectively. Finally, the reliability of the model is verified by experiments.},

The integrated scheduling of these processes is crucial for the efficiency of the system. Current reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to interact effectively with the real world. Digital twin (DT) presents a promising solution to this challenge by providing real-time synchronized simulation. We propose a RL method enhanced by DT to address the integrated scheduling problem in ACTs. The RL model is trained in a DT-based simulation environment, which is more accurate and real-time than traditional simulations. This approach allows for easy transfer of the RL model to a real-world environment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we present an experiment in this paper. Our proposed method shows promising results and has the potential to increase container logistics efficiency in ACTs.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={In recent years, the increasing emphasis on sustainability and carbon footprint reduction has required the exploration of innovative optimization techniques for data center operators. In this paper, we introduce a Concurrent Carbon Footprint Reduction (C2FR) Reinforcement Learning framework, designed to optimize data center energy consumption, load shifting, and battery operation decisions in real time. The C2FR framework utilizes short-term forecasts and incorporates Reinforcement Learning Energy ($A_{E}$), Battery ($A_{BAT}$) and Load-Shifting ($A_{LS}$) agents to optimize and effectively manage the intricate dependencies and information exchange between these individual optimization strategies, thus overcoming the limitations of existing isolated approaches. When compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, the C2FR framework demonstrates its effectiveness across various data center scenarios. The AE agent achieves a 7.9% reduction in pollutant emissions and a 7.8% reduction in energy cost on average. Moreover, the C2FR framework enables further emission reductions through the application of the battery and load-shifting optimization, leading to a total reduction of 10.17% in pollutant emissions on average over different data center configurations. This highlights the potential of the C2FR framework in addressing data center sustainability challenges and improving real-time carbon footprint optimization.},

  year={2023},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={In recent years, the idea of teleoperating robots to perform manipulation tasks has gained popularity. Being able to take remote control of a robotic system performing an assembly task provides exciting possibilities for industry, not only operating the robot in hazardous environments, but also facilitating the accessibility of human workers, requesting help from a remote expert, or even teaching skills. With the rise of teleoperated manipulators, it is expected that tools that facilitate the interaction of humans with the remote environment will be more prevalent in industry, leading to a greater availability of them. This is the case with Virtual Fixtures (VFs), which are collections of abstract sensory information overlaid on top of reflected sensory feedback from a remote environment. Other ever more prevalent tools are Digital Twins (DTs), virtual representations of systems that facilitate bidirectional communication between the real and the virtual worlds. Being more likely than ever that factories have both an implemented Digital Twin of a system and VFs for a particular manipulation system, we propose a method to leverage both tools. In this paper, methods to integrate already existing VFs in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipeline and to use RL to construct an optimal VF to aid the human user in a telemanipulation task are proposed, tackling the cumbersome problems of reward function and VF design. The results show that this approach is able to correctly estimate the right parameters of predefined VFs and open the possibility to future work in this topic.},

  pages={852-859},
  abstract={Without a doubt, Food is a vital part of any Human's life, not only because of the nutrients provided but also the excellent taste. Subsequently, countless great people have invested their life in exchange for this enjoyment upon Human taste buds. However, even a three-Michelin-starred chef cannot remember the detailed steps to all the dishes, and ordinary citizens do not have the time or energy to create their recipes. This paper proposes an aid system that uses neural networks to achieve accurate recipe projections to facilitate life. A deep learning system based on Decoder and Encoder is implemented using CNN and Transformer. The CNN reduces the memory cost by transforming the image to a vector, achieving faster processing. The Transformer is used to determine ingredients' presence and combine the information of existing dishes to construct an instruction. Such a network can facilitate food production and research. It is making the creation of unique dishes convenient by revolutionizing the method of recording. After the model is created, the backbone network of CNN layers are manipulated to test for the best result. Backbone network tests include ResNet50, ResNet152 without attention, ResNet152 with attention, Vgg16, and AlexNet. Out of all tested, ResNet152 is resulted with the highest iou (Intersection over Union), and without-attention is chosen as it possesses less complexity than its counterpart. Then, knowledge distillation is applied to decrease the complexity and size of the model. This process used the complex model as a trainer to the student model by basing the student training on the result of the teacher model, achieving a similar level of accuracy with a significantly lower complexity and size. This decrease in complexity increases the portable capability of the model, potentially applying into applications and websites on devices in the future without consuming much memory.},

  abstract={One of the strongest needs of an Electric Utility is the in-depth knowledge of its assets and networks. With its Network Digital Twin® program Enel Grids put in place the basis for expanding and accelerating this knowledge to its deepest. A fundamental part of this journey is collecting, organizing, and processing the survey data coming from the field. Applying innovative and cutting-edge technologies allows to squeeze all the possible values from the collected data, put in place a real "data democratization" across all the organization and collect important benefits such as improved asset location and management, infrastructure health monitoring, predictive and fast maintenance processes, optimized network operation and emergency management. Hence Network Digital Twin® foundation layer leads to enhanced grid resilience and boosts data-driven decisions, playing an important role in terms of sustainability and achievement of Network carbon neutrality. Network Digital Twin® Foundation Layer is based on technologies that ranges from cloud and big data to cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence computer vision models based on machine learning, used to perform massive and automated extraction of electric networks features from the collected survey data. The survey data consist of 3D point cloud data from LIDAR sensors and images (RGB and thermal) collected within reglementary periodic inspection process using helicopter, drones, mobile mapping systems and terrestrial laser scanner. Survey data represents a frequently updated snapshot of the “real world” (the visible networks assets, both from the aerial network and from the Primary and Secondary substations) and it is integrated by additional satellite data. In this paper we want to share the main technologies that run "under the hood" and play a central role in the realization of the project, the challenges and problems involved with their implementation and their use, the lessons learned, the impacts of their use on consolidated business processes and how Enel Grids approached the systematic collection and management of the huge amounts of data that grows every day together with the integration of the Network Digital Twin® within its corporate IT solutions platform.},

In fact, not all networks are incorporated into such digital environments. However, with the deployment of smart meters, new possibilities emerge that do not necessitate the modelling of these digital twins. In this work, end users' consumption data is utilised to predict emerging voltage congestion due to the rapid increase of electric vehicles and renewable energy sources. Additionally, not only does this allow to monitor the voltages, but it is also able to identify the grid standard violations. To this end, historical voltage profiles, power consumption and injection data derived from smart meters are exploited. All results are being validated through a power flow study applied on a low-voltage distribution network.},

This method uses a single sensor array coupled to the wall to collect the elastic wave data excited by the leak source. Besides, the distance  $R$  and the direction  $\theta $  between the leak source and the sensor array are calculated based on CNN and STCA respectively, to finally obtain the location ( $R$ ,  $\theta$ ) of the leak source. In this paper, the digital twin model of the experimental platform is established, the training set is obtained by the finite element simulation, and the CNN model applied to the elastic wavefield images is studied and constructed.

As a result, it becomes possible to identify the current pose of a human body (e.g., an elderly individual in a care home) solely using RF signals (e.g., WiFi signals in a home) without relying on visual signals or video information, meaning that this approach effectively addresses privacy concerns by allowing pose identification without compromising personal privacy. To ensure its efficacy, we implement CKD for distilling logits in our integrated software-defined radio (SDR)-based experimental setup and investigate the RF-visual signal correlation. Our CKD-RF sensing technique is characterized by two modes—a camera-fed teacher class network (e.g., images and videos) with an SDR-fed student class network (e.g., RF signals). Specifically, our CKD model trains a dual multibranch teacher–student network by distilling and fusing knowledge bases. The resulting CKD models are then subsequently used to identify the multimodal correlation and teach the student branch in reverse. Instead of simply aggregating their learnings, CKD training comprises multiple parallel transformations with the two domains, i.e., visual images and RF signals. Once trained, our CKD model efficiently preserves privacy and utilizes the multimodal correlated logits from the two different neural networks (NNs) to estimate poses solely using RF signals.},

  abstract={The widespread adoption of consumer electronics devices coupled with the emergence of 6G technology has led to the establishment of an extensive network of interconnected devices, forming the underlying infrastructure of the Internet of Things (IoT). Nevertheless, this interconnectivity introduces a myriad of security concerns, given that these devices become susceptible to malicious activities and unauthorized breaches. Moreover, conventional intrusion detection systems encounter difficulties in managing imbalanced data scenarios, wherein the count of normal instances vastly exceeds that of intrusion instances. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for 6G-enabled consumer electronics device intrusion detection, leveraging the power of federated meta-learning and digital twins within a Meta-Verse environment. By leveraging the distributed intelligence of meta-learning across a network of devices, our framework enables efficient and accurate detection of intrusions while mitigating the impact of imbalanced data. Furthermore, by utilizing digital twins within a Meta-Verse environment, we create a scalable and controlled setting for experimentation, enabling the development and evaluation of intrusion detection algorithms in a realistic yet controlled manner. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in detecting intrusions on 6G-enabled consumer electronics devices. The federated meta-learning approach achieves superior performance compared to traditional intrusion detection methods, especially in imbalanced data scenarios.},

  abstract={The vision of Web 3.0 is to promote decentralized, intelligent, and autonomous Internet by self-learning and self-adaption of user demands. Such Internet evolution is enabled by ubiquitous and low-latency communication and powerful computing, imposing significant challenges on the Web 3.0 architecture and its network orchestration. The successful implementation ofWeb 3.0 relies on dynamic perception and intelligent decision-making, which is difficult to conceive owing to the heterogeneity and dynamics of networks. Digital twins, as an emerging technology, can map the real-time network status and make optimal decisions to enable intelligent low-latency communications. This article introduces a digital twin architecture to achieve networking virtualization and digitalization for Web 3.0. Based on the architecture, the digital twin-empowered low-latency communication scheme is proposed by disseminating tasks to the resource-sufficient infrastructure, while considering the communication cost of deploying digital twins. Illustrated results demonstrate the superiority of digital twins for low-latency communications in Web 3.0.},

  abstract={Polarization encoded Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is attracting great attention as it generates unlimitedly and unconditionally secure keys for different use cases. Despite its theoretical excellence based on quantum physics, commercial optical devices supporting QKD systems lack precision, which highly limits the final Key Exchange Rate (KER) of the system. Beside optical component imperfections, eavesdropping and unpredicted environmental events occurred in the quantum channel increase quantum Bit Error Rate (qBER), which leads to further KER reduction. In this paper, we propose DARIUS, a digital twin for polarization encoded QKD systems that bridges the gap between perfect theoretical QKD systems and real implementations to: i) address optical components' non-ideal behavior; ii) discern eavesdropping from high qBER; and iii) dynamically compensate for environmental events. Taking advantage of DARIUS, even moderate eavesdropping rates can be distinguished from qBER. Moreover, significant improvement in proactive environmental event compensation is achieved, as DARIUS can derive proper optical component tuning.},

  pages={3191-3211},
  abstract={The high-speed mobile networks offer great potentials to many future intelligent applications, such as autonomous vehicles in smart transportation systems. Such networks provide the possibility to interconnect mobile devices to achieve fast knowledge sharing for efficient collaborative learning and operations, especially with the help of distributed machine learning, e.g., Federated Learning (FL), and modern digital technologies, e.g., Digital Twin (DT) systems. Typically, FL requires a fixed group of participants that have Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data for accurate and stable model training, which is highly unlikely in real-world mobile network scenarios. In this paper, in order to facilitate the lightweight model training and real-time processing in high-speed mobile networks, we design and introduce an end-edge-cloud structured three-layer Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, incorporated with an edge-cloud structured DT system. A dual-Reinforcement Learning (dual-RL) scheme is devised to support optimizations of client node selection and global aggregation frequency during FL via a cooperative decision-making strategy, which is assisted by a two-layer DT system deployed in the edge-cloud for real-time monitoring of mobile devices and environment changes. A model pruning and federated bidirectional distillation (Bi-distillation) mechanism is then developed locally for the lightweight model training, while a model splitting scheme with a lightweight data augmentation mechanism is developed globally to separately optimize the aggregation weights based on a splitted neural network structure (i.e., the encoder and classifier) in a more targeted manner, which can work together to effectively reduce the overall communication cost and improve the non-IID problem. Experiment and evaluation results compared with three baseline methods using two different real-world datasets demonstrate the usefulness and outstanding performance of our proposed FRL model in communication-efficient model training and non-IID issue alleviation for high-speed mobile network scenarios.},

Evaluation is intended to determine students' abilities so that the learning process can be improved according to student needs. Unfortunately, exercises and evaluations that are appropriate to the student's personality are difficult to do traditionally by teachers. In order to make the evaluation process easier and more personal, a system that is able to assist the process of training and evaluating students is needed. The adaptive training system allows the system to provide questions that can increase students' motivation and abilities. In addition, the form of the questions can be in accordance with the circumstances of the students. A methodology based on qualitative research using the Grounded Theory method was applied in this study. The proposed framework consists of several layers, including the User layer, Input Output layer, Model and AI/Machine Learning layers. Input Output can consist of a variety hardware. The model layer can consist of student model and domain model. The AI/Machine Learning layer can consist of item classification modules, student condition monitoring, questions recommendations, student performance evaluations, learning path recommendations, gamification engine, prevention action, questions generator. It is intended that the framework created would satisfy the proper evaluation requirements of each student in order to encourage learning and enhance student abilities.

Specifically, in order to maximize the energy efficiency of the biosensors guaranteeing the reliability of the emergency-critical physiological data transmission and modeling the nondeterminacy of the stochastic environment, we transform the problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) by jointly considering the transmission mode, relay selection, transmission power, and time slot allocation.

  abstract={With the development of cutting-edge technologies and the efforts of business giants, Metaverse is becoming increasingly reachable. In addition to the fields of healthcare, education and cultural tourism, Metaverse will also have a profound impact on the power grid. The digital twin (DT) is regarded as the foundation of Metaverse, but its high cost hinders the broad application of DTs in power grids. In this paper, we propose a path to build the DTs in the direct current (DC) microgrid, which is a representative block in the future power grid with the penetration of renewable energy sources, forming Grid-Metaverse that can significantly reduce the cost and improve the interactivity. A model-based DT, which is originated from the physical model, and a data-driven DT, using the graph neural network with the data from the model-based one, are built together to illustrate this path and to show their roles in the Grid-Metaverse. Moreover, in the prototype tests, the threats of denial-of-service (DoS) and false data injection (FDI) attacks are validated through the developed DTs.},

  abstract={Developing realistic and interactive virtual environments is a major hurdle in the progress of Metaverse. At present, majority of Metaverse applications necessitate the manual construction of 3D models which is both time-consuming and costly. Additionally, it is challenging to design environments that can promptly react to users’ actions. To address this challenge, this PhD Forum paper proposes a novel approach to generate virtual worlds using digital twin (DT) technology and AI through a Text-to-Metaverse pipeline. This pipeline converts natural language input into a scene JSON, which is used to generate a 3D virtual world using two engines: Generative Script Engine (GSE) and Generative Metaverse Engine (GME). GME generates a design script from the JSON file, and then uses it to generate 3D objects in an environment. It aims to use multimodal AI and DT technology to produce realistic and highly detailed virtual environments. The proposed pipeline has potential applications including education, training, architecture, healthcare and entertainment, and could change the way designers and developers create virtual worlds. While this paper covers an initial work as per the PhD Forum’s guidelines, it contributes to the research on generative models for multimodal data and provides a new direction for creating immersive virtual experiences.},

  abstract={Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely used to optimize the performance of multi-UAV networks. However, the training of DRL relies on the frequent interactions between the UAVs and the environment, which consumes lots of energy due to the flying and communication of UAVs in practical experiments. Inspired by the growing digital twin (DT) technology, which can simulate the performance of algorithms in the digital space constructed by coping features of the physical space, the DT is introduced to reduce the costs of practical training, e.g., energy and hardware purchases. Different from previous DT-assisted works with an assumption of perfect reflecting real physics by virtual digital, we consider an imperfect DT model with deviations for assisting the training of multi-UAV networks. Remarkably, to trade off the training cost, DT construction cost, and the impact of deviations of DT on training, the natural and virtually generated UAV mixing deployment method is proposed. Two cascade neural networks (NN) are used to optimize the joint number of virtually generated UAVs, the DT construction cost, and the performance of multi-UAV networks. These two NNs are trained by unsupervised and reinforcement learning, both low-cost label-free training methods. Simulation results show the training cost can significantly decrease while guaranteeing the training performance. This implies that an efficient decision can be made with imperfect DTs in multi-UAV networks.},

  abstract={The digital twin and metaverse are actively utilized as media that contain immersive content in various fields such as entertainment, education, and manufacturing. When using immersive content utilizing these technologies, various interface methods are employed. Direct contact or wearable devices that can recognize user actions for interaction have physical limitations caused by the difficulty of accurately recognizing user movements and the use of surrounding equipment. Similarly, camera-based interfaces that recognize user actions have physical limitations due to wired connections to the main body and compatibility issues with other operating systems due to noncompliance to any global or national standards.In this paper, we propose a metaverse avatar teleport system based on user pose estimation using AIoT edge devices on the oneM2M IoT platform. The proposed system transmits the final human pose skeleton estimated by PoseNet to the Teleport Information Extractor after receiving the input image from the webcam. The teleport information extractor extracts four keypoints that serve as the basis for posture estimation for teleportation from the transmitted human pose skeleton and estimates one of the three postures for teleportation using those keypoints. The estimated teleport information is then sent from the IoT client M/W to the IoT server M/W.The metaverse interworking module, which is designed for integration with the metaverse, receives the Teleport Information through communication using HTTP and MQTT. And IoT server M/W transmits the teleport command corresponding to the received Teleport Information to the metaverse server, thereby repositioning the user avatar’s position and direction vector in the metaverse. This system is compatible with all devices that comply with the oneM2M standard and does not have spatial constraints when using content due to the use of network-based connections instead of wired connections.},

In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end system architecture for a real-time video-based parking management system that can be easily scaled and enforced in a Smart-City context. Using state-of-the-art object detection and tracking methods combined with novel Static Object Detection techniques, we demonstrate a localized strategy for identifying potential parking spaces. A separate parking occupancy classification pipeline is discussed which provides fast and accurate availability status of these parking spaces. Furthermore, a 3D digital-twin application to monitor and visualize the parking spaces is demonstrated. Our experiments in a real-world scenario demonstrate the significant potential of our proposed architecture to easily scale to a given city with minimal manual efforts and lower implementation costs.},

  abstract={Digital twin technology deployed in the industrial Internet of Things (IoT) will be unavailable because of data heterogeneity and data islands. As a machine learning approach for distributed architectures, federated learning generates a global model for edge devices by only transferring model parameters, and it ensures that the private data of each device is not leaked. This is naturally suitable for solving this problem. Because devices' data cannot be exchanged with other devices, one major challenge is learning an effective model among devices with heterogeneous data. Motivated by this issue, we propose hierarchical federated learning using a hypernetwork (HN) algorithm to alleviate the influence of non-IID data among the devices, including label distribution skew, quantity skew, and feature distribution skew. The lower layer of our method uses hypernetworks to generate the parameters of the local model for the devices, while its upper layer updates hypernetworks by aggregating their model parameters. It decouples the number of parameters transmitted by the upper and lower layers, and it achieves good accuracy while improving communication efficiency and reducing computation costs.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a teacher-student network for industrial anomaly detection tasks using knowledge distillation techniques, where the feature representation capabilities of the teacher network model are utilized to guide the student model in efficiently identifying anomalous images. In detail, the VGG model is introduced as the backbone network for anomaly detection. Meanwhile, a residual attention mechanism is proposed to improve the feature output capability of the student network. The student network is able to learn good feature extraction abilities due to the robust feature representation of the teacher network. At the same time, the residual attention mechanism enhances the student network's ability to characterize the output of normal data features, amplifying the feature differences between the student and teacher networks for abnormal data. In summary, this paper addresses the problem of difficult detection of small targets in anomaly detection. Experimental validation has been performed on the industrial anomaly detection dataset MVTec-AD, which ultimately achieved 96.70% and 97.94% results for detecting and localizing, respectively. Compared with the other anomaly detection methods, the method proposed in this paper achieves a significant performance improvement.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Emerging latency-sensitive applications (e.g. factory automation control, industrial metaverse, digital twin-enabled smart manufacturing) require that the networks ensure data delivery with a guaranteed low and bounded latency. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) mechanisms have been developed to enable deterministic features in standard Ethernet. 5G and 6G networks are looking forward to integrate TSN and benefit from its ability to ensure determinism. Accommodating the complexity of TSN networks in 6G is not straightforward. In particular, conventional rule-based heuristic algorithms are not optimized for such environments. Therefore, the TSN network management framework should be equipped with the right tools allowing to compute at runtime new TSN configuration for each event (e.g. change in topology, new application, new device, etc.). To address this problem, recent standardization initiatives (IETF and ITU-T) have investigated the opportunities to use Network Digital Twin (NDT) paradigm for these use cases of 6G networks.This paper proposes a framework that puts together the key enablers to support NDT deployment for TSN-based public or private 6G network and to cope with the relevant challenges. In particular, we define a modular and self-learner NDT framework. To construct the DT model, the framework can rely on open source simulators/emulators with predefined models, or in other cases, it may learn the DT model from real infrastructure using Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) techniques trained over collected data. The paper also showcases how NDT, Software-Defined Network (SDN) and deterministic networks (TSN and DetNet) are key enablers for 6G network architecture.},

  abstract={In this research, we discuss the impact of combining model-based deep learning and game theory in dynamic games to develop a sample-efficient self-learning methodology for smart production systems. We propose a novel approach, namely Model-Based Game Theory (MBGT), by incorporating model-based deep learning into a successful self-learning strategy of State-based Potential Games. Most of the advanced self-learning approaches are established based on machine learning and artificial intelligence, including reinforcement learning and game-theoretical method. However, because of the iterative behaviour during the learning processes, the learning processes are almost impossible to be conducted directly in a real-world manufacturing environment. One potential approach is to conduct the learning processes using the digital representation of the systems, e.g. the digital twin or simulation. Nonetheless, such representations in industrial settings are not always available and developing a digital representation of a complex system is immensely challenging. Hence, this problem can be solved through model-based learning, in which deep learning models are trained to predict the dynamics of the systems with a small margin of error. Then, the trained models are deployed as virtual environments for the learning processes of the GT-based control policies, instead of learning in the real world. In this study, we implement MBGT to a bulk good system and thoroughly analyse the performances between training in the real system and virtual environment, which eventually turn out to be positive effects.},

  abstract={Current industrial communication systems (ICS) are undergoing a transformation, leveraging a multitude of technologies to meet the specific needs of the manufacturing and automation industries. The convergence of these networks into edge, fog, and cloud architectures has enhanced their scalability and facilitated the deployment of advanced data-driven approaches, such as machine learning for optimizing production processes. However, ensuring proper provisioning of network and computation resources, along with delivering quality of service, is increasingly challenging in these complex communication systems. Zero-Touch Management (ZTM) frameworks promise to reduce complexity and minimize dependence on manual configuration by human experts. Successful deployment of such frameworks requires an accurate Network Digital Twin (NDT) of relevant network elements, as autonomous decision-making heavily relies on the quantity and quality of historical and real-time node and link state information provided by the NDT. However, the use of NDTs for ICS and ZTM in particular is still an emerging research topic. This paper therefore proposes a theoretical use-case for an NDT-based ZTM framework to improve resource utilization in cloud-centered networks. It presents a state-of-the-art analysis of recent NDT advances enabling the deployment of related ZTM approaches and discusses associated challenges and future research directions.},

  abstract={In this paper, we describe the design, implementation, and installation of a digital twin version of a physical CO2 monitoring system with the aim of democratizing access to affordable CO2 emission measuring and enabling the creation of effective pollutant reduction strategies. The presented digital twin acts as a replacement that enables the measuring of CO2 emissions without the use of a physical sensor.

To this end, an optimized Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was trained to be capable of predicting CO2 emission concentrations with 87.15% accuracy when performing on the MCU.

  abstract={Recent statistics and studies show that the loss generated by insider threats is much higher than that generated by external attacks. More and more organizations are investing in or purchasing insider threat detection systems to prevent insider risks. However, the accurate and timely detection of insider threats faces significant challenges. In this study, we proposed an intelligent insider threat detection framework based on Digital Twins and self-attentions based deep learning models. First, this paper introduces insider threats and the challenges in detecting them. Then this paper presents recent related works on solving insider threat detection problems and their limitations. Next, we propose our solutions to address these challenges: building an innovative intelligent insider threat detection framework based on Digital Twin (DT) and self-attention based deep learning models, performing insight analysis of users’ behavior and entities, adopting contextual word embedding techniques using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model and sentence embedding technique using Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) model to perform data augmentation to overcome significant data imbalance, and adopting temporal semantic representation of users’ behaviors to build user behavior time sequences. Subsequently, this study built self-attention-based deep learning models to quickly detect insider threats. This study proposes a simplified transformer model named DistilledTrans and applies the original transformer model, DistilledTrans, BERT + final layer, Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa) + final layer, and a hybrid method combining pre-trained (BERT, RoBERTa) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network model to detect insider threats. Finally, this paper presents experimental results on a dense dataset CERT r4.2 and augmented sporadic dataset CERT r6.2, evaluates their performance, and performs a comparison analysis with state-of-the-art models. Promising experimental results show that 1) contextual word embedding insert and substitution predicted by the BERT model, and context embedding sentences predicted by the GPT-2 model are effective data augmentation approaches to address high data imbalance; 2) DistilledTrans trained with sporadic dataset CERT r6.2 augmented by the contextual embedding sentence method predicted by GPT-2, outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of all evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Additionally, its structure is much simpler, and thus training time and computing cost are much less than those of recent models; 3) when trained with the dense dataset CERT r4.2, pre-trained models BERT plus a final layer or RoBERTa plus a final layer can achieve significantly higher performance than the current models with a very little sacrifice of precision. However, complex hybrid methods may not be required.},

  abstract={Developing affordable and efficient methods to utilize hydrogen from renewable sources is a crucial hurdle that must be overcome to achieve a low-carbon economy and industrial decarbonization. One promising solution is the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which is a commercially attractive fuel cell that can support the implementation of decarbonization techniques for the transport sector. However, the unstable operation and undesired degradation will significantly shorten PEMFC's lifetime, which is a serious barrier to its commercialisation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a digital twin-enabled online remaining useful life prediction method for PEMFC, based on the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network and the quantile Huber loss (QH-loss). Our approach involves using a digital model that can be learned from a short period of online monitoring data and then used to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) for upcoming data. By utilizing the proposed digital twin method, we can simulate the performance of the PEMFC in real-time, providing accurate and timely predictions of its RUL. We conducted experiments on PEM fuel cell test rigs, varying the length of the data period used to train our digital twin model. The results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that our approach can accurately predict the remaining useful life of PEMFCs, even when trained with a short period of online monitoring data.},

The lack of information and data regarding the internal workings of certain systems makes virtual modelling for their Digital Twin challenging.

Therefore, a novel algorithm to model the Digital Twin of the industrial control black box system in the cyber domain has been presented in this paper.

  abstract={Digital twin serves as a crucial facilitator in the advancement and implementation of emerging technologies within 5G and beyond networks. However, the intricate structure and diverse functionalities of the existing 5G core network, especially the control plane, present challenges in constructing core network digital twins. In this paper, we propose two novel data-driven architectures for modeling the 5G control plane and implement corresponding deep learning models, namely 5GC-Seq2Seq and 5GC-former, based on the Vanilla Seq2Seq model and Transformer decoder respectively. We also present a solution enabling the interconversion of signaling messages and length-limited vectors to construct a dataset. The experiments are based on 5G core network signaling messages collected by the Spirent C50 network tester, encompassing various procedures such as registration, handover, and PDU sessions. The results show that 5GC-Seq2Seq achieves a 99.997% F1-score (a metric measuring the accuracy of positive samples) in single UE scenarios with a simple structure, but exhibits significantly reduced performance in handling concurrency. In contrast, 5GC-former surpasses 99.999% F1-score while maintaining robust performance under concurrent UE scenarios by constructing a more complex and highly parallel model. These findings validate that our method accurately replicates the principal functionalities of the 5G core network control plane.},

  abstract={Lung cancer, one of the most life-threatening malignancies, has witnessed a significant increase in its incidence and mortality rates over the past few decades. Accurate determination of the histological type of lung cancer is crucial for developing appropriate treatment strategies. However, traditional medical imaging analysis, such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography (CT), faces challenges due to sensor noise, patient variations, and pathological states, which may lead to misinterpretation and errors. In this regard, deep learning approaches can assist in rapidly distinguishing different types of lung cancer by learning complex patterns and features from medical imaging data, aiding clinicians in precise diagnosis. This research aims to address the limitations of existing lung cancer classification models, including suboptimal accuracy, slow inference speed, high computational and storage requirements, and vulnerability to overfitting. To achieve this, we propose an improved lung cancer classification and detection method based on deep learning. Our approach leverages transfer learning by utilizing pre-trained models, data augmentation techniques, and model compression methods, including global unstructured pruning and model distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that the teacher model achieves 100% accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score on the dataset, with a loss of 0.00007575038. The distilled student model, after pruning 55.15% of its parameters, achieves a 52.5% reduction in size. It also attains 100% accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, with an average loss of 0.004158932.},

  abstract={The vehicular metaverse is expected to provide a widely connected virtual Internet of Vehicles (IoV), where extended reality (XR) is one of the critical infrastructures.

Specifically, we propose a DT-enabled distributed XR service management framework to provide low-latency and smooth XR services across different domains in the vehicular metaverse. In addition, we present a case study on XR streaming-based virtualized resource allocation and propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method to minimize transmission latency. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the positive role of AI in connected AV networks can be enhanced by DTs.

  abstract={In this paper, we address the challenge of limited resources in Internet of Things (IoT) devices by proposing a solution based on digital twin in distributed edge computing networks. Edge computing is a promising approach that moves computing resources closer to the network’s edge to reduce response times in IoT applications. However, simply offloading tasks from IoT devices to edge computing does not accelerate user control. To enhance task performance and improve user management experience, we introduce optimized task scheduling and virtual object management based on a digital twin concept. Our system incorporates virtualization, synchronization, visualization, and simulation functionalities to provide digital twin capabilities. Additionally, we develop a user-friendly web application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for intuitive management of edge computing services. To support our approach, we implement an edge computing supervisor that generates virtualized objects such as edge gateways, IoT devices, and services. These virtual objects serve as resources for creating tasks. Using our proposed digital twin platform, users can dynamically create new tasks based on demand, easily deploy and execute tasks in specific locations, and dynamically allocate edge network resources according to task requirements. An optimized task scheduling mathematical model is presented to compare task scheduling done with and without optimization. Further, the edge computing and digital twin based optimized task scheduling method is integrated with Federated Learning for collaborative learning and privacy preserved computation of sensors sensitive data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by generating tasks for data collection related to indoor environment for prediction of Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) for thermal comfort index of smart homes occupants using HTTP and IoTivity-based devices in distributed edge computing networks. These tasks are properly delivered and executed on the expected edge gateways, showcasing the successful integration of our digital twin platform with edge computing networks. Further, the optimized task scheduling has improved the overall performance of the proposed system, keeping in view latency and processing time.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-14},
  abstract={The photogrammetry system has been widely used in industrial manufacturing applications, such as high-precision assembly, reverse engineering and additive manufacturing. In order to meet the demand of the product variety and short product lifecycle, the factory facilities including photogrammetry devices, should be relocated in response to rapid change in mechanical structure and hardware integration. Nevertheless, the camera position of the photogrammetry system is difficult to select to guarantee an optimal field of view (FoV) coverage of retro-reflective targets during the whole production horizon. Especially in a reconfigurable manufacturing work cell, scaling and calibration of a photogrammetry system requires professional skills and these would cost tremendous labour for rapid configuration each time. In this paper, we propose a novel deep optimisation framework for the photogrammetry camera position for the dynamic layout design based on digital twin. The optimisation framework follows an effective coarse-to-fine procedure to evaluate the FoV visibility over the target frame. In addition, the deep Q-learning algorithm is utilised to find the maximum FoV coverage and avoid collision. Three experiments are implemented to verify the application feasibility of the proposed deep camera position optimisation framework. Note to Practitioners—Large-volume in-process metrology is an essential element in flexible manufacturing systems. Quality of large-volume measurement relies heavily on target visibility within its field of view. In a compact industrial robotic cell, this is extremely challenging as the robot would take the primary position and causing view blockage throughout its operation. This makes the simultaneous monitoring of robot head and the work piece key feature extremely difficult. Manual trial-and-error positioning approach is lengthy and requires high level of expertise, due to both safety and spatial concerns. We approached this problem by simulating the camera’s view in a digital twin environment and maximising the target visibility throughout the full operation cycle. The generic framework can provide guidance in metrology setup within automated manufacturing environment, accelerate the system commissioning time, remove dependency of skill level and expand the capability for flexible/reconfigurable manufacturing systems. Although V-STARS camera are used in this application, the framework can be applied for other types of vision systems that requires field of view.},

  abstract={In real-world recognition of remote sensing (RS) targets, large amount of RS data is hard to be acquired at once, but arrives in batches, which means the constantly adaption of models for new data and new classes. However, training old and new data together from scratch has certain requirements on data storage space and retraining time, so incremental learning come to be desirable for future RS recognition systems. In this article, a class incremental learning method based on knowledge distillation is proposed for RS image classification. In order to better retain the knowledge of old tasks, a relation-based loss is used as a new matching manner in distillation loss, which frees the student model from the burden of matching the exact output of the teacher model.

To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel multi-stage semi-supervised method for remote sensing semantic segmentation, building upon a modified classical self-training scheme that leverages pseudo-labels. By dividing the data augmentation process into two stages, we employ various data augmentation strategies and balance the size of labels and pseudo-labels validated through rigorous experimentation, which can alleviate the student model from overfitting pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we also explore the efficacy of the Vision Transformer model in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, leading to further performance enhancements. The experimental results show that our semi-supervised remote sensing semantic segmentation method exhibits a more intuitive structure, easier deployment, and superior performance.},

  abstract={Commonly adopted in the manufacturing and aerospace sectors, digital twin (DT) platforms are increasingly seen as a promising paradigm to control and monitor software-based, “open”, communication systems, which play the role of the physical twin (PT). In the general framework presented in this work, the DT builds a Bayesian model of the communication system, which is leveraged to enable core DT functionalities such as control via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and monitoring of the PT for anomaly detection. We specifically investigate the application of the proposed framework to a simple case-study system encompassing multiple sensing devices that report to a common receiver. The Bayesian model trained at the DT has the key advantage of capturing epistemic uncertainty regarding the communication system, e.g., regarding current traffic conditions, which arise from limited PT-to-DT data transfer. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian framework as compared to standard frequentist model-based solutions.},

  pages={316-322},
  abstract={Real-time Digital Twinning of physical world scenes onto the Metaverse is necessary for a myriad of applications such as augmented-reality (AR) assisted driving. In AR assisted driving, physical environment scenes are first captured by Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) and are uploaded to the Metaverse. A central Metaverse Map Service Provider (MMSP) will aggregate information from all IoVs to develop a central Metaverse Map. Information from the Metaverse Map can then be downloaded into individual IoVs on demand and be delivered as AR scenes to the driver. However, the growing interest in developing AR assisted driving applications which relies on digital twinning invites adversaries. These adversaries may place physical adversarial patches on physical world objects such as cars, signboards, or on roads, seeking to contort the virtual world digital twin. Hence, there is a need to detect these physical world adversarial patches. Nevertheless, as real-time, accurate detection of adversarial patches is compute-intensive, these physical world scenes have to be offloaded to the Metaverse Map Base Stations (MMBS) for computation. Hence in our work, we considered an environment with moving Internet of Vehicles (IoV), uploading real-time physical world scenes to the MMBSs. We formulated a realistic joint variable optimization problem where the MMSPs' objective is to maximize adversarial patch detection mean average precision (mAP), while minimizing the computed AR scene up-link transmission latency and IoVs' up-link transmission idle count, through optimizing the IoV-MMBS allocation and IoV up-link scene resolution selection. We proposed a Heterogeneous Action Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO) (discrete-continuous) algorithm to tackle the proposed problem. Extensive experiments shows HAPPO outperforms baseline models when compared against key metrics.},

  abstract={Digital Twin Network (DTN) constructs a many-to-many mapping network by communicating and collaborating with massive Digital Twins (DTs), which can better assist the management and operation of large-scale modern systems. However, the emergence of DTN mirrors a growing demand for bulk data transfer between geo-distributed DT nodes in the physical network infrastructure. Conventional end-to-end connections are facing a great challenge in the presence of the background traffic fluctuation. In this paper, we propose a graph convolutional network (GCN)-enabled scheduling method to schedule bulk data transfers across the DTN in a store-and-forward (SnF) manner. Instead of solving the complex SnF scheduling problem on the entire network, the proposed method decomposes the problem into multiple sub-problems on different pre-computed routes. Instead of learning the scheduling results directly, the GCN model is used to predict the reachability of DT nodes. These unreachable nodes will be excluded from the scheduling process. Our studies show that the proposed method obtains better network performance and lower complexity when compared with the conventional scheduling methods.},

  abstract={Digital twin has been emerging as a promising paradigm that connects the physical entities and digital space, and continuously evolves and optimizes the physical systems. In this paper, we focus on studying the efficient data communication and computation when constructing the marine digital twin network with secrecy provisioning. Specifically, we leverage the federated learning (FL) to train the digital twin model. In the process of FL, all unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) deliver the trained models with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to the high altitude platform (HAP) for the global model aggregation. Considering the possible eavesdropping on the HAP, we utilize the chaotic sequences to spread the model information during the global model broadcasting. In this framework, we further want to minimize the total energy consumption of completing the digital twin training by jointly optimizing the global accuracy, local accuracy, HAP's transmission power, and model uploading duration subject to the secrecy provisioning and latency constraint. Despite the non-convexity, we propose a low-complexity search algorithm (LCS-Algorithm) to solve this joint optimization problem. Finally, the numerical results validate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of optimality and time efficiency.},

  abstract={Recently, Google proposed a privacy-preserving framework, Federated Learning (FL), to realize the era of edge intelligence. However, the limited labeled data that can only be labeled by the data owner with domain know-how threatens the feasibility of FL. In fact, Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) is a key to leveraging the unlabeled data on the client side while the confirmation bias issue triggered by incorrect predictions in the old-fashion Teacher-Student structure drops the model accuracy significantly. In this paper, we introduce the state-of-the-art SSL technique called Meta Pseudo Labels (MPL), which advocates a feedback strategy in the Teacher-Student architecture to mitigate the performance degradation. Unfortunately, in FL the heterogeneous data without sharing among clients are non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). The knowledge that shuttles between the Teacher and Student model may be partial and undermine the effectiveness of MPL. To make a performance breakthrough, we proposed a novel FL framework called Federated Meta Learning with Synergetic Strategy (SynFMPL), which combines the advantages of both Teacher and Student models. To our best knowledge, we are the first work that integrates MPL technique in FL. Moreover, we specifically focus on the client side, which fully leverages the unlabeled data for model generalization. The experiment shows that SynFPML outperforms all baselines in various non-IID scenarios. The Student model in SynFMPL even exceeds the upper bound in all baselines by 4% and maintains a virtuous cycle in the learning process.},

  abstract={Practical deployments of Machine-Learning(ML)-based solutions for failure management in optical networks often suffer from limited data availability, due to, especially, scarcity of labelled data describing different failure scenarios. Transfer Learning (TL) is regarded as a promising direction in cases of data scarcity, thanks to its ability to transfer knowledge from a Source Domain (SD) (e.g. SD could be a digital twin or a laboratory testbed) to a Target Domain (TD) (e.g., the infield network). In this paper, we focus on cross-lightpath and cross-task application of TL for failure localization and failure detection in optical networks. We found that, depending on the number of retrained parameters in the ML model, cross-lightpath TL for failure localization provides satisfactory accuracy (higher than 90%, in some cases) with limited amounts of TD data, and is also convenient in terms of TD retraining duration with respect to cases where TL is not used. Moreover, we found that cross-task failure detection/localization reaches up to 12% or 25% improvement in TD accuracy when considering failure localization and detection as TD task, respectively.},

Particularly, two DTs are constructed for emulating the cloud-edge collaborative transcoding process by analyzing spatial-temporal information of individual videos and transcoding configurations of transcoding queues, respectively. Two light-weight Bayesian neural networks are adopted to fit the TWE models in DTs, respectively. Moreover, we formulate a transcoding-path selection problem to maximize long-term user satisfaction within an average service delay threshold, taking the dynamics of video arrivals and video requests into account. The problem is transformed into a standard Markov decision process by using the Lyapunov optimization, which is further solved by a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation results based on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively enhance user satisfaction compared with benchmark schemes.},

  abstract={The satellite-ground (SG) integrated networks are regarded as a promising network structure, which can provide ubiquitous intelligence and pervasive services for multiple ground users. Moreover, digital twin (DT) can drive real-time data mapping and wireless access from usual physical utilities to digital units. Therefore, the fusion of SG and DT can decrease the gap between real-time data analysis and physical system states, which can help boost SG-DT edge intelligence paradigms. Nevertheless, the unexpected task arrivals, time-varying channel gains, and distrust among ground devices cause the network service performance degradation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a privacy-assisted blockchain computation offloading model to shine upon original tasks to the corresponding aerial platforms, and then orchestrate the task scheduling, resource allocation, and privacy protection. Additionally, we envision a Lyapunov stability theory-based multi-agent federated reinforcement learning (LST-MAFRL) algorithm to further resolve the CPU cycle frequency, the size of each blockchain, the number of DTs, and related harvested solar energy to minimize the execution energy consumption and privacy time overhead. Finally, extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed LST-MAFRL algorithm framework outperforms some state-of-the-art benchmarks for the sake of execution energy efficiency, processed bit quantities, and privacy time overhead.},

  abstract={6G technology is expected to lead to an unpredictable increase of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The need for maintaining continuous connectivity of these devices has in turn led to re-thinking of the traditional design of wireless networks. In particular, the integration of 6G and Digital Twin (DT) is expected to reshape the network management as it offers powerful features in design, development and optimization processes. DT is a digital representation of physical entities, which are designed around a two-way information flow. Therefore, this technology not only collects data, and employs intelligent learning methods by performing complex computations, but it also can send feedback to improve system performance for 6G-enabled massive IoT. However, deploying such a technology requires addressing complex challenges such as limited resources, seamless connectivity and lack of trust between end users and network edge. To address these challenges, we formulate the resource allocation problem including edge computation and service migration in 6G-enabled massive IoT. The contributions are threefold: First, our DT-empowered architecture is proposed that uses the real-time and historical data from end users to find the best allocation at a user. Second, it studies the impact of trust relationship between computing entities to prevent the unauthorized accesses and provides an authentication procedure. Third, it describes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm that consists of cooperative agents and aims to find the best resource allocation strategy by minimizing task processing latency. We validate the proposed DT-empowered architecture to show the reduced processing latency compared to traditional benchmark methods.},

For this, we investigate an intelligent delay-sensitive task offloading scheme for the dynamic vehicular environment which provides computation resources via local execution, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and vehicle-to-infrastructure/RSU (V2I) offloading modes based on the energy consumption of the system. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation scheme in the DT (RADiT) of the IoV network for maximizing its utility while optimizing the strategy of task offloading. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with and without the presence of V2V computation mode and another benchmark, DRL algorithm called soft actor-critic (SAC).

  abstract={As an up-coming digitalization technology, the digital twin (DT) offers a viable implementation for dynamic perception and intelligent decision-making in the industrial IoT (IIoT). For synchronizing the real-time information between the device and its DT, communication is fundamental to the digital twin system. Federated learning (FL) based DT model framework could be seen as an emerging paradigm to avoid large communication loads and high data leakage. However, the current digital twin model constructed scheme based on FL is not suitable for the heterogeneous IIoT scenario. Due to the different data distribution and different tasks among the devices, it leads to severe performance degradation when the personalized requirements of the DT model are ignored. In this paper, we propose a DT model framework based on personalized federated learning (PFL) to perform well for individual devices. Considering the historical personalized knowledge forgetting problem, the personalized federated learning with self-knowledge distillation (DTPFLsd) algorithm is proposed to avoid severe performance degradation and unnecessary time consumption of DT modeling. The numerical results compare with state-of-the-art FL-based DT architecture called DTWN and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DTPFLsd scheme.},

  pages={36-41},
  abstract={Realizing the potential gains of large-scale MIMO systems requires the accurate estimation of their channels or the fine adjustment of their narrow beams. This, however, is typically associated with high channel acquisition/beam sweeping overhead that scales with the number of antennas. Machine and deep learning represent promising approaches to overcome these challenges thanks to their powerful ability to learn from prior observations and side information. Training machine and deep learning models, however, requires large-scale datasets that are expensive to collect in deployed systems. To address this challenge, we propose a novel direction that utilizes digital replicas of the physical world to reduce or even eliminate the MIMO channel acquisition overhead. In the proposed digital twin aided communication, 3D models that approximate the real-world communication environment are constructed and accurate ray-tracing is utilized to simulate the site-specific channels. These channels can then be used to aid various communication tasks. Further, we propose to use machine learning to approximate the digital replicas and reduce the ray tracing computational cost. To evaluate the proposed digital twin based approach, we conduct a case study focusing on the position-aided beam prediction task. The results show that a learning model trained solely with the data generated by the digital replica can achieve relatively good performance on real-world data. Moreover, a small number of real-world data points can quickly achieve near-optimal performance, overcoming the modeling mismatches between the physical and digital worlds and significantly reducing the data acquisition overhead.},

  abstract={Millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz MIMO systems rely on pre-defined beamforming codebooks for both initial access and data transmission. However, most of the existing codebooks adopt pre-defined beams that focus mainly on improving the gain of their target users, without taking interference into account, which could incur critical performance degradation in the dense networks. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a sample-efficient digital twin-assisted beam pattern design framework that learns how to form the beam pattern to reject the signals from the interfering directions. The proposed approach does not require any explicit channel knowledge or any coordination with the interferers. The adoption of the digital twin improves the sample efficiency by better leveraging the underlying signal relationship and by incorporating a demand-based data acquisition strategy. Simulation results show that the developed signal model-based learning framework can significantly reduce the actual interaction with the radio environment (i.e., number of measurements) compared to the model-unaware design, leading to a more practical and efficient interference-aware beam design approach.},

  abstract={6G is envisioned to serve many compute-intensive and latency-sensitive applications which are now usually formed by functional components in the directed acyclic graphic (DAG) form. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is proven a promising way to offload computing tasks and reduce execution latency. However, the ever-increasing number and heterogeneity of edge computing nodes, as well as the dynamically changing resource state, hinder any centralized scheduler from getting the accurate and timely resource state in the huge number of edge nodes. In this paper, facing a large-scale MEC scenario, we propose a digital twin (DT) assisted multiagent-based task scheduling scheme to jointly optimize task offloading and resource allocation strategy for DAG tasks. The scheme exploits the evolutionary selection multi-agent reinforcement learning (ES-MARL) framework to expedite the training of a large number of agents, while the DT of the mobile edge network keeps the latest state data and enables the centralized training of these distributed agents. The simulation result shows that the proposed scheme can achieve the goals of reducing latency and energy consumption while improving the scheduling success rate, load balancing index, and training efficiency.},

  abstract={Federated edge learning can be essential in supporting privacy-preserving, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled activities in digital twin 6G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, we need to also consider the potential of attacks targeting the underlying AI systems (e.g., adversaries seek to corrupt data on the IoT devices during local updates or corrupt the model updates); hence, in this article, we propose an anticipatory study for poisoning attacks in federated edge learning for digital twin 6G-enabled IoT environments. Specifically, we study the influence of adversaries on the training and development of federated learning models in digital twin 6G-enabled IoT environments. We demonstrate that attackers can carry out poisoning attacks in two different learning settings, namely: centralized learning and federated learning, and successful attacks can severely reduce the model's accuracy. We comprehensively evaluate the attacks on a new cyber security dataset designed for IoT applications with three deep neural networks under the non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data and the independent and identically distributed (IID) data. The poisoning attacks, on an attack classification problem, can lead to a decrease in accuracy from 94.93% to 85.98% with IID data and from 94.18% to 30.04% with Non-IID.},

  abstract={With the development of deep learning technology and the application of large-scale models, high training costs and a large number of model parameters have become bottlenecks that limit technological development. To address these issues, existing model distillation techniques can transfer knowledge from large models to small models, reducing the model size and computational resource consumption while maintaining high performance. However, existing research has overlooked the privacy protection of input data and large models during the distillation process. In practical scenarios, the entities who train student models and own teacher models may be different institutions or countries, and how to protect the privacy of training data and teacher models is a challenge facing cross-institutional distillation learning. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving model distillation method combining random masking and threshold encryption systems. We introduce noise based on random masking into training data and encrypt the output of the teacher model, ensuring the privacy of the input data and teacher model while ensuring the performance of the distilled student model. We rigorously prove the security and correctness of the scheme in theory and validate its effectiveness through experiments. The experimental results show that the student model trained after data protection has a similar classification performance to the student model in the original distillation learning.},

  abstract={Most of the existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods mainly pursue improving the precision of human pose estimation, ignoring the model's complexity and making it impossible to deploy it on resource-constrained devices. In addition, some other methods overly pursue the model's lightweight, which significantly decreases the model's precision and affects the experience of practical applications. However, in reality, fast and accurate applications are often more popular, so this area of research is of some practical significance. To achieve lightweight deployment and better practical application, A lightweight human pose estimation model based on knowledge distillation is proposed, which firstly uses group convolution and channel shuffle operation to lighten the HRNet model to obtain the S-HRNet model. Secondly, a response-based knowledge distillation algorithm is proposed to use the pre-trained HRNet as the teacher model and S-HRNet as the student model with the help of an offline knowledge distillation strategy, and the prediction results of the teacher model are used to supervise the learning of the student model together with the real labels. Finally, this paper conducts a large number of experiments on the MS COCO dataset proposed by Microsoft, and the experimental results show that the model in this paper has a higher average precision and lower number of parameters and computations compared to the other models mentioned.},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Cortical cataract, a common type of cataract, is particularly difficult to be diagnosed automatically due to the complex features of the lesions. Recently, many methods based on edge detection or deep learning were proposed for automatic cataract grading. However, these methods suffer a large performance drop in cortical cataract grading due to the more complex cortical opacities and uncertain data. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based Knowledge Distillation Network, called TKD-Net, for cortical cataract grading. To tackle the complex opacity problem, we first devise a zone decomposition strategy to extract more refined features and introduce special sub-scores to consider critical factors of clinical cortical opacity assessment (location, area, density) for comprehensive quantification. Next, we develop a multi-modal mix-attention Transformer to efficiently fuse sub-scores and image modality for complex feature learning. However, obtaining the sub-score modality is a challenge in the clinic, which could cause the modality missing problem instead. To simultaneously alleviate the issues of modality missing and uncertain data, we further design a Transformer-based knowledge distillation method, which uses a teacher model with perfect data to guide a student model with modality-missing and uncertain data. We conduct extensive experiments on a dataset of commonly-used slit-lamp images annotated by the LOCS III grading system to demonstrate that our TKD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, as well as the effectiveness of its key components.

  abstract={The rapid adoption of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and digital twins (DTs) technologies within industrial environments has highlighted diverse critical issues related to safety and security. Sensor failure is one of the major threats compromising DTs operations. In this article, for the first time, we address the problem of sensor fault detection, isolation, and accommodation (SFDIA) in large-size networked systems. Current available machine-learning solutions are either based on shallow networks unable to capture complex features from input graph data or on deep networks with overshooting complexity in the case of large number of sensors. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new framework for sensor validation based on a deep recurrent graph convolutional architecture which jointly learns a graph structure and models spatio-temporal interdependencies. More specifically, the proposed two-block architecture 1) constructs the virtual sensors in the first block to refurbish anomalous (i.e., faulty) behavior of unreliable sensors and to accommodate the isolated faulty sensors and 2) performs the detection and isolation tasks in the second block by means of a classifier. Extensive analysis on two publicly available datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed architecture over existing state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract={This paper introduces an innovative approach to enhance traffic anomaly detection in transportation systems using deep learning and knowledge distillation. We create a robust dataset from 427 videos containing 1,415 accident-related events, spanning various anomalies like accidents, car crashes, and pedestrian violations. To address real-time anomaly detection challenges, we propose a novel lightweight neural network architecture inspired by EfficientNet-B0, designed for efficient video anomaly detection. Through knowledge distillation, a student model learns from a teacher model’s predictions, resulting in heightened anomaly detection accuracy. Experimental results highlight the approach’s efficacy, with the knowledge-distilled student model consistently outperforming the standalone lightweight network, achieving an accuracy of 94.83% compared to 94.16%. This research offers a practical solution for real-time traffic anomaly detection, which is especially valuable in resource-constrained environments. Fusing a unique dataset, EfficientNet-B0-like structure, lightweight architecture, and knowledge distillation holds significant potential for fostering safer and more efficient transportation systems.},

  abstract={According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), only the transportation for end-use sectors accounted for 37% of total CO2 emissions in 2021. To respond to this concern, this paper presents a new methodology in the field of Digital Twins (DTs) that simplifies decision-making on transportation and CO2 emissions on large geographic areas considering contextual high spatial granularity information for predictions from multiple sources, such as traffic, citizens mobility, events in correlated areas, and weather. This method is based on a hybrid system for traffic short-term forecasting and anomaly detection developed through Data Analytics (DA) and a novel Machine Learning (ML) approach for Time Series Analysis (TSA) able to scale in large scenarios while keeping the promptness of DT environments. The proposed system was developed through the knowledge extracted by a set of real multi modal transportation datasets and demonstrates better performance against conventional techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMAX and VARMA. Finally, this work was integrated in a DT solution for the optimization of transportation and its commitment with Net Zero Targets in a use case for Transport Decarbonization.},

  abstract={Tasks, understood as educational instructions to transform an initial state to a targeted state in the learner model, are central elements in (computer science) education, irrespective of the mode of delivery – online or classic face-to-face teaching. They appear in different roles; as learning objects that help acquire competencies, as assessment instruments for measuring learning success, or for practicing specific skills. However, as with any educational technology, proper handling and well-planned selection are crucial for successful teaching. Correspondingly, the requirements that tasks have to fulfill are wide-ranging: they should promote specific learning outcomes, be appropriate to address desired cognitive dimensions, and be tailored to the student to keep motivation and learning success high. To enable an on-demand, outcome-oriented, and individualized selection of tasks in adaptive learning systems, we need to formalize tasks in all dimensions. A detailed review of different models for cognitive processes, knowledge dimensions in education, tasks, and errors leads to the Y-Model, a model for formalizing tasks (in computer science). It forms the basis for an individual, competence-oriented integration of tasks in educational systems. Finally, we present the first implementation of the model.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Digital twins for wide-areas (e.g., smart cities) would fulfill the 6G expectation of merging the physical and digital worlds, abbreviated as "DT-WA". It would incorporate an artificial intelligent (AI) model to simulate and predict the physical world, which needs a constant parameter updating process to keep its fidelity. However, the updating process can consume significant energy, where little work exits. This paper proposes an energy-efficient edge cooperation and data collection scheme. The AI model is partitioned into a large amount of sub-models onto different edge servers (ESs) co-located with access points to simulate every part of the wide-area, which are distributed updated using locally-collected data. To reduce system energy, ESs can choose to become either updating helpers or recipients of their neighboring ESs, based on their available sensors and basic updating convergences. Helpers share their updated parameters with their neighboring recipients to reduce the latter workload. To minimize system energy, the paper further proposes a distributed algorithm to adaptively optimize ESs cooperative identities, data collections and heterogenous resource allocations in the dynamic environment. It incorporates several constraint-release methods and a large-scale multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the updating energy in DT-WA compared with baselines.},

In this paper, Using a deep learning-based top-down pose estimation algorithm, keypoints are extracted from three images and matched in a 3D virtual environment to create a digital twin. The coordinated digital twin delivers information to IoT devices in the real environment through actions that cannot be simulated in the real environment, such as shooting lasers in a virtual space.

This is particularly useful in scenarios where the real robot is in remote or dangerous areas that cannot be accessed by humans. It is worth noting that the system primarily focuses on achieving an initial end-to-end implementation, rather than on the learning component. The proposed system uses shape features extracted by using an RGBD camera and calculated by Computer Vision (CV) techniques to enable the DT to interact with the virtual version of real objects. The system is divided into four phases: demonstration, learning, execution, and evaluation, and is tested using objects of increasing shape complexity. The primary challenges of accurately translating real interaction into virtual interaction, detecting shape features using CV techniques, and ensuring feasible actions are addressed. The potential applications of this project include hazardous materials handling, manufacturing automation, and other scenarios where robots must interact with objects in various settings. The project aims to enable robots to perform complex interactions with objects without human intervention, increasing efficiency and safety in various industries.},

  abstract={The Metaverse, a 3-dimensional virtual realm mirroring real-world objects, promises transformative experiences. Its potential is tempered by data collection, confidentiality, and privacy concerns. In tandem with AI-enabled technologies, edge computing can provide a practical solution to overcoming many of these challenges. This paper argues that combining AI-enabled technologies with edge computing-specifically via federated learning (FL) can address these challenges. FL, as a privacy-centric distributed machine learning (ML) approach, enables knowledge sharing among Metaverse clients without compromising user data. However, while FL posits potential resolutions for the Metaverse, a discernible lacuna remains in the comprehensive study of its overarching consequences. The literature misses an extensive study of adopting these new deployment architectures, giving it significant research impact. This paper bridges this knowledge gap, exploring the symbiosis between the Metaverse and FL. We first introduce the foundational concepts of both domains and detail enabling technologies such as digital twins, the Internet of Things, brain-computer interfaces, blockchain, and extended reality. Next, we delve into practical applications of FL within the metaverse, spanning sectors like healthcare, education, e-commerce, gaming, and the military. Finally, the paper highlights the key challenges and future directions for integrating FL within the metaverse ecosystem.},

  abstract={Collaborative edge computing (CEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm, enabling edge nodes to collaborate and execute microservices from end devices. Microservice offloading, a fundamentally important problem, decides when and where microservices are executed upon the arrival of services. However, the dynamic nature of the real-world CEC environment often leads to inefficient microservice offloading strategies, resulting in underutilized resources and network congestion. To address this challenge, we formulate an online joint microservice offloading and bandwidth allocation problem, JMOBA, to minimize the average completion time of services. In this paper, we introduce a novel microservice offloading algorithm, DTDRLMO, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and digital twin technology. Specifically, we employ digital twin techniques to predict and adapt to changing edge node loads and network conditions of CEC in real-time. Furthermore, this approach enables the generation of an efficient offloading plan, selecting the most suitable edge node for each microservice. Simulation results on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DTDRLMO outperforms heuristic and learning-based methods in average service completion time.},

We believe that these underestimated data contain valuable information that remains largely unexplored. We present a novel uncertainty-guided different levels of pseudo-labels (UDLP) framework to explore the underestimated data in medical images. The framework consists of a student-teacher model that uses uncertainty to classify the pseudo-labels predicted by the teacher model into three levels: high confidence, low confidence and unreliability. The student model learns directly from high-confidence pseudo-labels. By using the confident learning method in low-confidence pseudo-labels, the teacher model corrects the noisy labels in low-confidence voxels to provide positive feature information for the student model. We design a method for removing unreliable pseudo-labels, to further enhance model’s generalizability. The proposed framework UDLP is evaluated on two datasets and demonstrates superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Lidar is a typical sensor in the fields of autonomous driving, environment-aware robots, and industrial automation. The 3D point cloud data collected by it contains rich 3D spatial information, and the surface description of objects is also close to reality, which helps people perceive complex scenes. In recent years, the deep learning-based lidar 3D point cloud data processing method has received widespread attention, realizing automatic feature learning from large amounts of data and realizing target detection and semantic segmentation of complex scenes. Among them, most methods need to learn model parameters based on a large amount of labeled data. However, the annotation of 3D point cloud data is more time-consuming and laborious than that of 2D images. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a point cloud data labeling method based on the combination of semi-supervised learning and knowledge distillation. Firstly, the existing point cloud data is denoised by the improved three-dimensional guided filtering method to remove useless noise. Then, the classic Bilateral Augmentation and Adaptive Fusion (BAAF) point cloud semantic segmentation model is used as the teacher model. Moreover, to enhance the point cloud data, the local semantic context of the pyramid is introduced. We further generate high-quality pseudo-labels through the class range balance module. Finally, the rapid training of the student model is completed through the teacher averaging method in knowledge distillation and the obtained pseudo-labels. During the experiment, we discuss the labeling effect on the point cloud data of the public SemanticKITTI dataset and compare it with the scribble-annotated ScribbleKITTI data, to verify the ability of the proposed method.},

We introduce a novel MobileViT-based depth (MViTDepth) network that can effectively capture both local features and global information by leveraging the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a vision transformer (ViT). To further compress the proposed MViTDepth model, we employ knowledge distillation, which leads to improved depth estimation performance. Specifically, the self-supervised MDE MonoViT is used as a teacher model to construct the knowledge distillation loss for optimizing a student model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MViTDepth significantly outperforms Monodepth2 in terms of parameters and accuracy, thereby indicating its superiority in application to edge devices.},

  abstract={The agricultural industry has excellent potential to grow because of the vast opportunities and demands. However, despite the significant potential in agriculture, especially mushroom cultivation, there are still some problems, such as a gap between yields and market demand, because mushroom cultivators cannot produce optimal mushroom production in quality and quantity. Proper and effective cultivation processes must be carried out to produce quality oyster mushroom products in large quantities. Implementing the digital twin concept by utilizing Internet of Things and Machine Learning technology will have many good impacts to make it easier for mushroom cultivators to monitor oyster mushroom cultivation. The digital twin concept will focus on characteristics so it can represent physical objects as closely as possible. IoT will playa massive role in providing data in real-time through sensors so that things that cannot be seen physically can be known based on their data and machine learning will support the virtual modeling process so that monitoring data for mushroom growth will be available in real time according to their respective characteristics. Implementing the digital twin concept in the mushroom cultivation monitoring system requires five stages: creation, communication, aggregation, analysis, and insight. Based on the research, the digital twin concept has a huge opportunity to optimize the mushroom cultivation process because it will help mushroom cultivators know the mushroom's environmental and physical conditions in real time. Besides that, implementing digital twins will help predict environmental and mushroom conditions, harvest time estimates, treatment recommendations on each of the different mushroom characteristics, and other informative insights.},

This work proposes the use of Digital Twins as the means of optimising the trilemma trade-off of blockchain i.e., re-configuring system parameters such as to maximise scalability, decentralisation and security. Specifically, through a bi-directional feedback loop between the system and the digital twin, simulation, what-if analysis and machine learning techniques will be employed for the computation of an optimal configuration given the current system state. Furthermore, a dynamic update mechanism is proposed to allow for blockchain reconfiguration without violating the decentralisation of the system.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) is a virtual replica of a physical system that is constantly receiving information from different data sources, enhancing its operations and processes through data analytics, predictions and simulations. The development of DTs relies on advancements in cutting-edge technologies namely IoT, Big data, Cloud computing and Artificial Intelligence; and although it was initially conceived in manufacturing, it is currently contributing to the digital transformation of several fields including aeronautics, healthcare, urban planning and agriculture. The existing body of research suggests that it will be expanded in the next few years with the implementation of sophisticated applications, therefore different proposals to achieve collective work between DTs have been investigated. Nevertheless, much research is needed to develop and validate appropriate mechanisms to ensure its successful deployment in complex real-world cases that require collaboration among individual systems. A Federated Digital Twin (FDT) has been identified as a promising solution for this approach, since it allows the interconnection among autonomous DTs in the virtual space, leveraging their advantages and enabling interaction, collaboration and shared learning. Additionally, since a FDT is envisaged as a network of cooperative DTs, cognitive principles can be applied to assist the overall operations through knowledge acquisition and reasoning, leading to an informed and intelligent decision making. This study aims to expand the FDT concept, develop mechanisms for coordination and synchronization based on well-defined FDT goals and connectionism theory. Furthermore, four architectural styles are provided to enable the integration of collaborative DTs within a federated environment, aiming to improve the operations in complex real-world systems.},

This approach allows operators from different domains to rapidly adapt to a new way of working and reduces redundant learning costs, while also enabling intuitive robot control. To further enhance this paradigm, integrating Mixed Reality (MR) technology has emerged as a promising approach to creating and working in a virtual workspace while having a safe environment for training. This work develops a framework, based on digital twin representation, to integrate the MR with real-life equipment and humans. This allows for the control of a collaborative robot in an environment with objects or humans perceived by the eye-in-hand visual sensor. The efficiency of the proposed framework is emphasized by a comparison of Unity simulations versus the real-time behavior of the collaborative robot.},

  abstract={In the context of autonomous driving, the effective recognition and understanding of traffic police gestures is crucial for safe driving on the road. Pedestrians’ body movements affect the driving system’s understanding of traffic police gestures; therefore, the localization and recognition of traffic police is key to the understanding of traffic police gesture. With the development of deep learning technology, a satisfactory traffic police localization and recognition model requires a huge amount of accurately labelled datasets, but there are no publicly available relevant datasets, and the cost of accurate labelling of datasets is extremely high, limiting the performance of the model. To address this problem, this paper proposes a High-Quality Proposals generation algorithm based on weak supervision (HQP). HQP improves the quality of region proposal generation by effectively enhancing the classification ability of a student model through guidance from a pre-trained teacher model. To compensate for the lack of localization information in image-level annotation data, HQP integrates gradient-weighted class activation maps to improve the model’s localization ability. HQP effectively reduces the workload of accurate data labelling and completes the automated labelling of data on traffic police localization and positioning by combining manual fine-tuning methods.},

  abstract={Propelled by recent advances in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and the Internet of Things (IoT), the digital twin technique has been envisioned as a de-facto driving force to bridge the virtual and physical worlds through creating digital portrayals of physical objects. In virtue of the flourishing of edge intelligence and abundant IoT data, data-driven modelling facilitates the implementation and maintenance of digital twins, where simulations of physical objects are usually performed based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). A significant advantage of adopting digital twins is to enable decisive prediction on the behaviours of objects in near future without waiting for that really happen. To provide accurate predictions, it is vital to keep each digital twin synchronized with its physical object in real-time. However, it is challenging to maintain the real-time synchronization between a digital twin and its physical object due to the dynamics of physical objects and sensing data drift over time, i.e., the live data from a physical object diverge from the model training data of its digital twin. To address this critical issue, continual learning is a promising solution to retrain models of digital twins incrementally. In this paper, we investigate digital twin synchronization issues via continual learning in an MEC environment, with the aim to maximize the total utility gain, i.e., the enhanced model accuracy. We study two novel optimization problems: the static digital twin synchronization problem per time slot and the dynamic digital twin synchronization problem for a finite time horizon. We first formulate an Integer Linear Program (ILP) solution for the static digital twin synchronization problem when the problem size is small; otherwise, we develop a randomized approximation algorithm at the expense of bounded resource violations for it. We also devise a deterministic approximation algorithm with guaranteed performance for a special case of the static digital twin synchronization problem. We thirdly consider the dynamic digital twin synchronization problem by proposing an efficient online algorithm for it. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms for continuous digital twin synchronization through simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms are promising, outperforming counterpart benchmarks by no less than 13.2%, in terms of the total utility gain.},

Heterogeneous learning models and diverse learning methods are employed at different scales of solution, progressing toward specificity, adaptation, and accuracy.

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) technology, as a promising technology, can achieve the vehicular contexts mapping of the virtual world and physical world in a collaborative autonomous driving (CAD) system. DT technology is developed on the basis of C-V2X, 6G, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Machine Learning (ML) and other technologies, which can enable the creation of robust and reliable digital twin-based collaborative autonomous driving architectures, providing a platform for testing, validating, and refining autonomous driving systems in a highly efficient and safe manner. However, the future large-scale CAD system needs greater real-time processing and resource collaboration capability for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Especially considering the mobility of AVs, it puts higher demands on the management of AVs. In this paper, we present a digital twin (DT)-based collaborative autonomous driving (DTCAD) three-layer architecture in C-V2X to provide better resource management of AVs. In order to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) and reduce the processing latency in large-scale CAD scenarios, a scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning and Mean Field Game method (DDPG-MFG) are proposed, where the dynamic and real-time interaction between AVs is approximated as a mean-field gaming process in DT resource allocation. Especially, to improve the interaction efficiency between AVs and CAD environment, we design more efficient exploitation and exploration algorithms for AVs. The CARLA simulation demonstrates our proposed algorithm significantly reduces the task offloading latency, and improves the average rewards by 28.5%, 3.5%, and 6.8%, compared with traditional DDPG, TD3, and AC, respectively.},

  abstract={This paper analyzes the requirements for the reporting rate of the live data source to support the operation of Digital Twins (DTs) of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) for real-time power systems monitoring applications. The visibility of distribution networks is currently limited due to the lack of sufficient measurement and communication infrastructures. With the rapid increase of DERs, it becomes increasingly important to improve the visibility of the distribution networks to ensure the critical system operating constrains are continuously met. DTs are virtual replicas of physical systems, and with certain live measurement data, they can be used to accurately represent the real-time dynamics of the physical entities. The features of DTs could therefore be applied to increase the visibility of network and potentially support real-time decisions making. This paper presents the investigation of the impact of data reporting rate on DT accuracy, based on which, the paper presents a method that could be used to quantify the minimum requirements for data reporting rate to adequately support the DT operation, which provides valuable learning for specifying measurement devices and communication networks to enable DTs-based solutions.},

  abstract={The utilization of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) greatly enhances the quality of public services, whereas presents challenges to effective mission planning. Existing research predominantly concentrates on task allocation and path planning, with limited emphasis on integrating UAV deployment and task allocation. Despite the promise of learning-based approaches for joint optimization, their applicability to sim-to-real problems remains restricted. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical decision-making framework empowered by digital twin (DT) technology to enhance resource-efficient utilization and facilitate realtime mission planning. In the upper layer, a swarm of UAVs is divided into subgroups using a K-means method and strategically deployed to corresponding task regions. In the lower layer, a DT-enabled reinforcement learning approach is adopted to leverage real-world experiences. Specifically, we employ a multiagent deep Q learning algorithm to optimize the training process, where each agent interacts with the DT environment through original and target networks to acquire an optimal strategy.

  abstract={Battery packs in electric vehicles are managed by battery management systems that influence the state of charge among the cells in the pack, where such systems have received much attention in research. More recently, balancing the temperature among the cells has become a research topic. In our work, we consider a dual-balancing problem where we aim to balance both the parameters of the state of charge and temperature. We consider a Smart Battery Pack, where individual cells can be bypassed, meaning that no current is going to or from the cell, which allows the cell to cool off while the cell does not charge or discharge. Moreover, a smart battery pack can estimate each cell's characteristics, which, in turn, can be used to define a model of cell and battery pack behavior. We conduct experiments using the model of a battery pack where each cell differs in its configuration as an effect of aging. For such a pack with heterogeneous cells, we use Q- Learning in U ppaal Stratego to synthesize a controller that maximizes the time spent in a balanced state, meaning that all cells' states are within a specific range of each other. We show significant improvements in two aspects compared with two threshold-based controllers that balance either state of charge or temperature. The synthesized controllers are only unbalanced with the state of charge between 1-4% of the time and for temperature between 15-20% of the time. The threshold-based controllers are either unbalanced for the state of charge for as much as 37 % of the time or for temperature for as much as 44 % of the time. Finally, the maximum variations of state of charge and temperature among the cells are decreased.},

  abstract={Modern Cyber-Physical Systems are characterized by dynamic and complex structure. They are facing factors such as erroneous software update, Artificial Intelligence components, reconfigurable structure, etc. Because of that, they are prone to latent or dormant faults. With the growth of data that needs to be processed, traditional error-handling mechanisms are failing to be efficient enough. For this reason, Deep Learning methods come into play. Application of such methods for detection and handling of error is nowadays a vastly used approach. However, the development of Deep Learning-based error detectors is time-consuming because there is no general approach to automatically exploit the specifics of the given system. In order to effectively address this issue, we propose a new hybrid deep learning-based methodology called Remedy. It comprises three steps: (1) identification of critical fault parameters, (2) automatic search for efficient access points for training data generation, and (3) deployment of deep learning-based error detector. To illustrate the effectiveness of this methodology, we present an implementation example on a classical Simulink model. Comparing the results with the corresponding baseline, the authors discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method.},

  abstract={As known, the smart Grid is an essential scenario for Industry 5.0. With its rapid development, the huge number of sensors and smart devices widely used in the industrial field generate significant amounts of data that sharply increase. Facing the power grid environment with a high amount of data, it is easy to cause abnormal conditions in the power grid system and even cause the system to collapse abruptly. To tackle this problem, we simulate a layered digital twin power grid model, using the comparative learning method to process the time series in the power grid and select the positive and negative time series samples using a new slider. In the extended Convolution Neural Network (CNN), we use the Atrous Convolution model, limiting the receptive field and concentrating more data close to the dimension of the model. The time series and process classification tasks are predicted on Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT), electricity, and University of California, Riverside (UCR) data sets, and experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the error rate of 4.38% and 5.21% in the prediction task and improves the accuracy of 8.39% and 12.73% in the classification task, indications to control the power grid model more accurately, predicting the power grid operation in the future, and take corresponding measures in time.},

  abstract={This paper investigates a digital twin (DT) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided mobile edge computing (MEC) system under given constraints on ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC). In particular, we focus on the problem of total end-to-end (E2E) latency minimization for the considered system under the joint optimization of beamforming design at the RIS, power, bandwidth allocation, processing rates, and task offloading parameters using DT architecture. To tackle the formulated non-convex optimization problem, we first model it as a Markov decision process (MDP). Later, we adopt deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to solve it effectively. We have compared the DDPG results with proximal policy optimization (PPO), modified PPO (M-PPO), and conventional alternating optimization (AO) algorithms. Simulation results depict that the proposed DT-enabled resource allocation scheme for the RIS-empowered MEC network using DDPG algorithm achieves up to 60% lower transmission delay and 20% lower energy consumption compared to the scheme without an RIS. This confirms the practical advantages of leveraging RIS technology in MEC systems. Results demonstrate that DDPG outperforms M-PPO and PPO in terms of higher reward value and better learning efficiency, while M-PPO and PPO exhibit lower execution time than DDPG and AO due to their advanced policy optimization techniques. Thus, the results validate the effectiveness of the DRL solutions over AO for dynamic resource allocation w.r.t. reduced execution time.},

The DT4I4-Secure presents a framework to create Digital Twins (DT) for I4.0 systems using a combination of models (including physics and data-based models). This paper showcases the use of the DT framework to detect attacks on I4.0 systems by comparing observations with future predictions from the DT. This paper evaluates the performance of the DT4I4-Secure for a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) turning process manufacturing a metallic spool, wherein the experimental results show the model can predict normal operations with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.005081. This work also explores using an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) based dynamic threshold instead of a traditional static threshold for attack detection when the CNC turning process is under three separate attack scenarios. The DT4I4-Secure combined with the dynamic threshold shows a 3.46 times improvement in F1-Scores over all three attack scenarios for instantaneous attack detection while having 100% accuracy during the manufacturing cycle.},

  abstract={Recent advances in big data and artificial intelligence have led to active research in emotion recognition based on multimodal transformer models. Although these multimodal transformer models demonstrate high performance, their applications into real-time services are challenging due to their heavy computational requirements. Therefore, this study proposes a Multi-Still method, which transfers the multimodal knowledge of a teacher model to a student model using the knowledge distillation method supporting edge to cloud continuum environment. Multi-Still trained by text and voice data from Korean multimodal emotional datasets (KEMDy19, KEMDy20) both teacher and student. As a result, the student model transferred knowledge from the teacher model showed a 21% increase in number of inferences per second compared to the teacher model, 70.31% reduction in network size, and 65% reduction in the number of parameters. Nevertheless, it shows similar accuracy to the teacher model. We provide real-time emotion recognition services for the lightweight resources in edge continuum by efficiently learning multimodal data through knowledge distillation.},

  abstract={This study investigates the fusion of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) and generative adversarial networks (GAN), targeting specifically the flight dynamics modeling of Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Emphasis is placed on the beneficial role of transfer learning, which utilizes pre-existing models for cognate tasks, leading to heightened model efficiency and decreased computational expenses. This approach is particularly advantageous in the realm of PIML, facilitating model applicability across similar systems or scenarios. The research notably introduces a novel set of models capable of generating physically viable scenarios, thereby increasing the authenticity and effectiveness of digital twins for system dynamics prediction. Validation of this methodology through a series of flight simulations and tests reveals a significant decrease in prediction error post-transfer learning implementation. The PIGD model, for instance, shows an average error reduction of 11.30% relative to the model trained using flight test data, thus enabling more accurate predictions with scarce flight data and mitigating issues related to extensive flight tests such as safety, time, and cost. This study considerably aids in the advancement of urban air mobility, especially concerning eVTOL aircraft, and sets the stage for future explorations and applications of PIML in intricate domains.},

  abstract={Prompt-based learning has been recently popular as an emerging data efficient approach to parameter fine-tuning for various few-shot classification tasks. The knowledge transfer from a large-scale pre-trained language model could be systematically performed. It is challenging to conduct transfer learning from unlabeled data. Pseudo labeling is feasible to enhance the model generalization by unsupervised learning where additional pseudo labeled data are augmented. However, this method likely suffers from the model bias problem due to the incorrect pseudo labels. This paper presents a new collaborative pseudo labeling for prompt learning which is implemented through a teacher-student model where teacher and student are learned collaboratively. Accordingly, the resulting pseudo labels do not mislead the model while the few-shot classification task can be improved. The experiments on few-shot sentiment classification and natural language inference show the merit of collaborative pseudo labeling and prompt tuning compared with the other methods.},

  abstract={Accurate three-dimensional (3D) color models play a crucial role in various emerging applications, such as geographic surveying and mapping, smart cities, and digital twin cities. To achieve high-fidelity representations of large-scale scenes, recent advancements in machine learning techniques and LiDAR-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) have been instrumental. Leveraging these cutting-edge technologies, this paper presents a sensor-fusion framework that integrates a solid-state LiDAR, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a monocular camera. Additionally, a point cloud upsampling technique is introduced into LiDAR SLAM to enhance the density of the point clouds. Within this framework, the LiDAR-IMU odometry accurately estimates the positions and poses of the collected point clouds. Simultaneously, synchronized images are captured and utilized to incorporate texture information into the point clouds. The proposed framework demonstrates its capability to generate highly detailed and dense 3D color models for large-scale outdoor scenes, all within a limited on-site scanning time. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) technology connects various aspects of society and enhances human life. Electric vehicles (EVs) and charging stations (CSs) are essential components of the IoT system, offering business opportunities for companies like the aggregator. The aggregator can maximize profit by implementing various CSs management strategies, such as pricing and charging scheduling. However, managing CSs presents challenges due to irrational human behavior, particularly uncertain CS selections by EV users. To address this issue, we propose a cooperative model for CSs that incorporates the cognitive hierarchy quantum response CS selection model. In this model, EV users are considered to possess k-level rationality, and the charging environment is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) based on this user model. To make optimal decisions for CSs from the MDP, we propose a denoising autoencoder-based deep reinforcement learning (DEEDRL) method. This method learns from the uncertain environment and effectively denoises the state space using a pre-trained autoencoder. In addition, to reduce the computational burden caused by time-varying strategies, we design a discretization strategy for action space based on the current market rule of tiered pricing and CS types. Our experiments with real data demonstrate that our proposed method accurately portrays the CS selection behavior of irrational users in realistic scenarios. Furthermore, our method outperforms non-cooperative modes and benchmark cooperative algorithms regarding profitability, such as DDPG and DQN.},

  pages={729-733},
  abstract={Digital Twin of renewable integration equipment refers to the concept of creating a digital representation of the equipment by collecting streaming data from sensors and other sources to develop a machine learning model. By training the model based on historical data, the model should be able to predict system behavior based on streaming data inputs. Most models are static, but the streaming data may be non-stationary in the case of relevant factors, and that discretization of numeric data streams is perceived as undesirable. We argue that it can be desirable for a discretization to evolve in synchronization with an evolving data stream. We investigate the discretization of various streaming data from the equipment and implement computationally efficient incremental discretization algorithms. We show that allowing a discretization to drift in synchronization with distribution drift can further identify anomalies, detect potential issues, and predict future behavior based on real-time data. The incorporation of incremental discretization into the model enables continuous updates, leading to a more accurate representation of the renewable integration equipment. This improved accuracy facilitates better decision-making and optimization of renewable integration performance.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a cyber digital twin (CDT) for supporting the analysis of power system substation network security and validating solutions utilizing Machine Learning (ML) and Software Defined Networking (SDN). This work focuses on targeted attacks against the Generic Object Oriented Sub-station Event (GOOSE) protocol. The developed CDT mirrors a realistic substation network consisting of a real-time digital simulator (RTDS), industry-graded hardware relays, merging units, SDN switches, and related communication networks. The CDT consists of a virtual network to which external devices can connect, an open-source SDN flow controller to specify network packet destination, OpenFlow protocol to configure packet flows, a custom-built GOOSE parser and builder, and an open-source library to facilitate GOOSE message exchange between external hosts. Two use cases of GOOSE spoofing attacks were conducted, which were successfully detected using novel feature engineering and a machine learning approach, yielding an accuracy of 95%, precision of 96%, and F-1 score of 96%. Finally, SDN was introduced as a potential solution to mitigate such GOOSE attacks from the bottom up. The overall study underlines the proposed CDT for substation network design's efficacy in improving overall network resilience against GOOSE integrity attacks, as well as its potential for developing and validating solutions for cyber attack defense and mitigation for real-world systems.},

  abstract={Metaverse is a multidimensional virtual world that integrates digital twin space technology. It is an interactive and integrative process with the physical world, involving virtualization and digitization of the real world. The high demands of the metaverse on transmission latency, processing speed, and security pose significant challenges to network load. In this article, we study an online distributed caching model in the context of digital twin metaverse. With unknown file popularity, we elaborate a collaborative caching system to optimize the burst bit error rate of wireless transmission while satisfying the latency requirements in metaverse applications. Then, we propose a meta-based self-supervised learning algorithm that can jointly allocate caching resources among various small base stations (i.e., metaverse edge nodes) in a distributed manner. Notably, given the system heterogeneity due to the massive number of devices in the metaverse, we cleverly introduce a multi-exits mechanism for neural networks to cope with the strong demand for ultra-low latency in metaverse applications. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by numerical simulations, which significantly improve the transmission efficiency compared with existing comparative methods, thus facilitating the development of green communication technologies. Therefore, these methods are of great relevance to the future development and application of metaverse.},

  abstract={In this study, we present a novel approach for efficient resource allocation in a digital twin (DT) framework for task offloading in a UAV-aided Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) network. Our approach incorporates a hybrid machine learning approach that combines asynchronous federated learning (AFL) and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to jointly optimize task completion rate, energy consumption, and delay parameters, enhancing overall system efficiency. We instantiate a DT infrastructure within a UAV-assisted IoV network for V2V and V2I task offloading with three task processing modes and three types of tasks. The DT network is composed of three distinct DTs: task vehicles, service vehicles, and roadside units. Subsequently, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the system efficiency while concurrently minimizing delay and total energy consumption. To address this challenging non-convex problem, we introduce a multi-agent DRL algorithm named MARS for resource allocation within the DT-assisted IoV network. This innovative algorithm, MARS, is trained to utilize a hybrid AFL approach referred to as HAFL. MARS optimizes the allocation of resources across various modes of computation, striving to maximize the system's overall utility. Finally, our proposed approach's effectiveness is validated through comprehensive simulation results, where it is compared against various benchmark schemes for evaluation.},

  abstract={Federated continual learning (FCL) is emerging as a key technology for time-sensitive applications in highly adaptive environments including autonomous driving and industrial digital twin. Each FCL trains machine learning models using newly-generated datasets as soon as possible, to obtain a highly accurate machine learning model for new event predictions. The age of data, defined as the time difference between the generation time of a dataset and the current time, is widely adopted as a key criterion to evaluate both timeline and quality of training. In this paper, we study the problem of age-aware FCL in a mobile edge computing (MEC) network. We not only investigate optimization techniques that optimize the data selection and aggregator placement for FCL but also implement a real system as a prototype for age-aware FCL. Specifically, we first propose an approximation algorithm with a provable approximation ratio for the age-aware data selection and aggregator placement problem for FCL with a single request. In real application scenarios, there are usually multiple FCL requests that require to train models, and delays in the MEC network are usually uncertain. We then study the problem of age-aware data selection and aggregator placement problem for FCL with uncertain delays and multiple requests, by devising an online learning algorithm with a bounded regret based on contextual bandits. We finally implement a prototype for FCL in an MEC network, with various heterogeneous user equipments (UEs) and cloudlets with different computing capabilities in the network. Experiment results show that the performance of the proposed algorithms outperform existing studies, by achieving 47% lower age of data and 12% higher model accuracy.},

  abstract={In recent years, the use of E-learning systems has increased and their efficiency has been improved, especially after emergence events like the COVID-19 crisis and other emergency situations like earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. E-learning applications present a solution for the continuity of the learning process. Learner models have been intensively applied in the learning system to improve online learning. In order to achieve this objective, it is imperative to use adaptive learning systems because learners do not have the same mental capacities and similar physical characteristics. In fact, each learner has individual features such as knowledge, goals, experiences, interests, backgrounds, personal traits, learning styles, learning activities, and study results. To make the learning content available for all learners, facilitate the learning process, and meet the learner's needs, an adaptive learning system was introduced as an alternative to the standard and traditional "one-size-fits-all". The learner model is the pivot of any adaptive learning environment, which permits the improvement of the learning process. This paper introduces a new learner model including 2 dimensions: (1) static dimensions (demographic information, interests, background, experience, learning style preference and learning situation), and (2) dynamic dimensions (Learning materials, emotion, motivation, engagement, and interaction). The developed model is applied to improve the learning process and enhance the learning results in any learning situation. Our approach is a combination of many methods and techniques to initialize and update the learner model for learning personalization. The main objective of our paper is to develop a learner modeling architecture and the way that is used to provide an adaptive learning process.},

This technology allows companies to create and manage virtual models of their physical systems and processes. This allows them to perform simulations and improve their performance. The paper reviews the various challenges and opportunities that DT technology offers in Industry 4.0.

The paper also explores the possibilities offered by DT technology to transform the manufacturing industry. Although it offers numerous advantages, it acknowledges that overcoming the challenges that DT brings can be a daunting task. In addition to investing in a robust data infrastructure, the paper also suggests that organizations establish partnerships with technology firms and develop a skilled workforce that can take advantage of DT capabilities.

  abstract={To provide a better support for various vehicular applications, digital twin (DT), as an emerging technology, can enable a virtual presentation of physical vehicular networks to reflect the current network state through real-time data updating. However, the constrained resources and high data updating cost may degrade the performance of DT. In this paper, we trade off the data updating cost and the performance of DT to adaptively determine the resource management and computation offloading in vehicular networks. Specifically, we propose a novel vehicle to vehicle pairing prediction algorithm assisted by DT to improve the offloading decision efficiency and investigate the effect of data updating frequency on prediction accuracy. Based on the prediction results, we formulate a joint data updating frequency selection, offloading decision and channel allocation problem with the objective of minimizing the computation and communication costs. To solve the formulated problem, we propose a prediction-based stability maximum pairing algorithm to obtain the proper task offloading strategy. Moreover, a deep Q-learning network algorithm is proposed to select the optimal DT data updating frequency according to the real-time vehicular network state. Based on the obtained optimal solution, we further propose an alternating direction method of multipliers-based iteration algorithm to optimize the computation and channel resource allocation and minimize the total costs. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks have made a revolution in different areas of Artificial Intelligence such as image classifi-cation and object detection. However, most of these models are heavy and time-consuming at the inference stage. If we desire to use real-time applications, it’s necessary to lighten them up. However, this could negatively affect the performance of models. One suggested approach for enhancing the capabilities of smaller models involves a technique called knowledge distillation. In this method, a less advanced model, referred to as the student model, learns from and emulates the more advanced teacher model to enhance its performance. This method has been proven as an effective technique to compress the model and increase its accuracy. Previous methods mostly focus on proposing feature transformation and loss functions between the same level’s features to improve the effectiveness. In this paper, we investigate the effect of connections between different layers of teacher and student networks and reveal their great importance. We have employed three different loss functions—attention-driven distillation, hierarchical context loss, and non-local loss—to enhance the classifier’s overall performance. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset show that the proposed method has a great performance improvement. For the benefit of the research community, we will make the code for this study available on GitHub.},

  abstract={This paper presents a study on improving human action recognition through the utilization of knowledge distillation, and the combination of CNN and ViT models. The research aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of smaller student models by transferring knowledge from larger teacher models. The proposed method employs a Transformer vision network as the student model, while a convolutional network serves as the teacher model. The teacher model extracts local image features, whereas the student model focuses on global features using an attention mechanism. The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture is introduced as a robust framework for capturing global dependencies in images. Additionally, advanced variants of ViT, namely PVT, Convit, MVIT, Swin Transformer, and Twins, are discussed, highlighting their contributions to computer vision tasks. The ConvNeXt model is introduced as a teacher model, known for its efficiency and effectiveness in computer vision. The paper presents performance results for human action recognition on the Stanford 40 dataset, comparing the accuracy and mAP of student models trained with and without knowledge distillation. The findings illustrate that the suggested approach significantly improves the accuracy and mAP when compared to training networks under regular settings.

  abstract={Digitalisation in railway networks harnesses digital technologies to optimise operations, leading to enhanced efficiency, and reduced energy consumption. By analysing real-time data, railways can predict maintenance needs, improve passenger experiences, and seamlessly integrate with other transport modes. As societies strive for sustainable transportation solutions, it is imperative to understand and collect digitalisation techniques to enhance efficiency and reduce the ecological footprint of railway networks. This paper serves as a snapshot of the current state of the art addressing the pivotal role of point cloud techniques in advancing railway digitalisation and providing valuable pointers for future research directions. Employing a systematic review approach, our study concentrates exclusively on research centred around railway assets and their digitalisation via point cloud data. We have themed the literature into pre-processing, modelling, and digital twinning. Within this review, we analyse diverse modelling and pre-processing techniques and categorise them for clarity. The digital twin techniques are also collected, though these techniques are scarce in the context of railway infrastructure and point clouds. The paper also presents a compilation of dataset statistics highlighting the scarcity of openly available railway-specific datasets. This scarcity considerably hampers the feasibility of research reproducibility and the comparative analysis of different approaches. Our conclusion reflects on the challenges encountered and proposes a course for future research. Particularly, we conclude that hybrid methodologies that combine machine learning with structure-based techniques hold substantial promise toward creating digital twins, considering the intrinsic characteristics of railway infrastructure.},

  year={2023},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={The use of microservice-based applications is becoming more prominent also in the telecommunication field. The current 5G core network, for instance, is already built around the concept of a “Service Based Architecture”, and it is foreseeable that 6G will push even further this concept to enable more flexible and pervasive deployments. However, the increasing complexity of future networks calls for sophisticated platforms that could help network providers with their deployments design. In this framework, a central research trend is the development of digital twins of the physical infrastructures. These digital representations should closely mimic the behavior of the managed system, allowing the operators to test new configurations, analyze what-if scenarios, or train their reinforcement learning algorithms in safe environments. Considering that Kubernetes is becoming the de-facto standard platform for container orchestration and microservice-based application lifecycle management, the implementation of a Kubernetes digital twin requires an accurate characterization of the microservice response time, possibly leveraging suitable Machine Learning techniques trained with measurement data collected in the field. In this paper we introduce a new methodology, based on Mixture Density Networks, to accurately estimate the statistical distribution of the response time of microservice-based applications. We show the improvement in performance with respect to simulation-based inference procedures proposed in literature.},

  abstract={Device-edge collaboration on deep neural network (DNN) inference is a promising approach to efficiently utilizing network resources for supporting artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) applications. In this paper, we propose a novel digital twin (DT)-assisted approach to device-edge collaboration on DNN inference that determines whether and when to stop local inference at a device and upload the intermediate results to complete the inference on an edge server. Instead of determining the collaboration for each DNN inference task only upon its generation, multi-step decision-making is performed during the on-device inference to adapt to the dynamic computing workload status at the device and the edge server. To enhance the adaptivity, a DT is constructed to evaluate all potential offloading decisions for each DNN inference task, which provides augmented training data for a machine learning-assisted decision-making algorithm. Then, another DT is constructed to estimate the inference status at the device to avoid frequently fetching the status information from the device, thus reducing the signaling overhead. We also derive necessary conditions for optimal offloading decisions to reduce the offloading decision space. Simulation results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our DT-assisted approach in terms of balancing the tradeoff among inference accuracy, delay, and energy consumption.},

  abstract={Network digital twin, as a fundamental enabling technology in emerging network scenarios and applications, establishes a connection between the physical and virtual networks through real-time representation and synchronization of physical entities. The value of network digital twins lies in their ability to accurately model future network states and behaviors, facilitating numerous downstream network tasks such as network optimization and management. However, the importance of network traffic prediction as an essential prerequisite module for these network tasks has been relatively overlooked. Limited surveys provide insights into the network traffic characteristics and advanced prediction models, resulting in performance degradation and unnecessary resource consumption. Hence, it deserves to explore an efficient data-driven traffic prediction framework that can adapt to different network tasks. This article first examines the general forms and characteristics of various network traffic based on specific datasets. Subsequently, we introduce a multi-module data-driven framework for network traffic prediction to effectively cater to diverse data types and downstream task requirements. A case study of cellular traffic prediction based on traffic characteristics and requirements is proposed to demonstrate the practicability of our framework. Finally, we outline several open challenges toward future traffic prediction in network digital twins.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-14},
  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD), which aims at transferring the knowledge from a complex network (a teacher) to a simpler and smaller network (a student), has received considerable attention in recent years. Typically, most existing KD methods work on well-labeled data. Unfortunately, real-world data often inevitably involve noisy labels, thus leading to performance deterioration of these methods. In this article, we study a little-explored but important issue, i.e., KD with noisy labels. To this end, we propose a novel KD method, called ambiguity-guided mutual label refinery KD (AML-KD), to train the student model in the presence of noisy labels. Specifically, based on the pretrained teacher model, a two-stage label refinery framework is innovatively introduced to refine labels gradually. In the first stage, we perform label propagation (LP) with small-loss selection guided by the teacher model, improving the learning capability of the student model. In the second stage, we perform mutual LP between the teacher and student models in a mutual-benefit way. During the label refinery, an ambiguity-aware weight estimation (AWE) module is developed to address the problem of ambiguous samples, avoiding overfitting these samples. One distinct advantage of AML-KD is that it is capable of learning a high-accuracy and low-cost student model with label noise. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets show the effectiveness of our AML-KD against state-of-the-art KD methods and label noise learning (LNL) methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Runqing-forMost/ AML-KD.},

Our work includes heuristic and constant approximation algorithms for offline multi-FL service scenarios and we also investigate an online setting of our solution with dynamic bandwidth and moving client conditions. To adapt to changing network conditions, we utilize historical bandwidth data in DTs and implement a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Ra_DDPG, for automatic bandwidth allocation. Evaluation results demonstrate a significant 49.8% increase in system utility compared to a benchmark algorithm, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach.},

  year={2023},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={The recurrent neural network (RNN)-based equalizers, especially the bidirectional long-short-term memory (biLSTM) structure, have already been proven to outperform the feed-forward NNs in nonlinear mitigation in coherent optical systems. However, the recurrent connections still prevent the computation from being fully parallelizable. To circumvent the non-parallelizability of recurrent-based equalizers, we propose, for the first time, knowledge distillation (KD) to recast the biLSTM into a parallelizable feed-forward 1D-convolutional NN structure. In this work, we applied KD to the cross-architecture regression problem, which is still in its infancy. We highlight how the KD helps the student's learning from the teacher in the regression problem. Additionally, we provide a comparative study of the performance of the NN-based equalizers for both the teacher and the students with different NN architectures. The performance comparison was carried out in terms of the Q-factor, inference speed, and computational complexity. The equalization performance was evaluated using both simulated and experimental data. The 1D-CNN outperformed other NN types as a student model with respect to the Q-factor. The proposed 1D-CNN showed a significant reduction in the inference time compared to the biLSTM while maintaining comparable performance in the experimental data and experiencing only a slight degradation in the Q-factor in the simulated data.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Low-delay high-gain optimal multi-hop routing path is crucial to guarantee both the latency and reliability requirements for infotainment services in the high mobility internet of vehicles (IoVs) subject to queue stability. The high mobility in multi-hop IoVs reduces reliability and energy efficiency, and becomes bottleneck for the optimal route solution using classical optimization methods. To a great extent, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method is not applicable in IoVs environment because of the continuously changing topology and space complexity, which grows exponentially with the number of state variables as well as the relaying hops. Usually, in multi-hop scenario, network reliability and latency are affected by mobility as well as average hop count, which limit the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) link connectivity. To cope with this problem, in this paper, we formulate a minimum hop count delay-sensitive buffer-aided optimization problem in a dynamic complex multi-hop vehicular topology using a digital twin-enabled dynamic coordination graph (DCG). Particularly, for the first time, a DCG-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DCG-MADDPG) decentralized algorithm is proposed that combines the advantage of DCG and MADDPG to model continuously changing topology and find the optimal routing solutions by cooperative learning in the aforementioned communications. The proposed DCG-MADDPG coordinated learning trains each agent towards highly reliable and low latency optimal decision-making path solutions while maintaining queue stability and convergence on the way to a desired state. Experimental results reveal that the proposed coordinated learning algorithm outperforms the existing learning in terms of energy consumption and latency at less computational complexity.},

  title={Causal Semantic Communication for Digital Twins: A Generalizable Imitation Learning Approach}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={4},
  number={},
  pages={698-717},
  abstract={A digital twin (DT) leverages a virtual representation of the physical world, along with communication (e.g., 6G), computing (e.g., edge computing), and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to enable many connected intelligence services. In order to handle the large amounts of network data based on digital twins (DTs), wireless systems can exploit the paradigm of semantic communication (SC) for facilitating informed decision-making under strict communication constraints by utilizing AI techniques such as causal reasoning. In this paper, a novel framework called causal semantic communication (CSC) is proposed for DT-based wireless systems. The CSC system is posed as an imitation learning (IL) problem, where the transmitter, with access to optimal network control policies using a DT, teaches the receiver using SC over a bandwidth-limited wireless channel how to improve its knowledge to perform optimal control actions. The causal structure in the transmitter’s data is extracted using novel approaches from the framework of deep end-to-end causal inference, thereby enabling the creation of a semantic representation that is causally invariant, which in turn helps generalize the learned knowledge of the system to new and unseen situations. The CSC decoder at the receiver is designed to extract and estimate semantic information while ensuring high semantic reliability. The receiver control policies, semantic decoder, and causal inference are formulated as a bi-level optimization problem within a variational inference framework. This problem is solved using a novel concept called network state models, inspired from world models in generative AI, that faithfully represents the environment dynamics leading to data generation. Furthermore, the proposed framework includes an analytical characterization of the performance gap that results from employing a suboptimal policy learned by the receiver that uses the transmitted semantic information to construct a model of the physical environment. The CSC system utilizes two concepts, namely the integrated information theory principle in the theory of consciousness and the abstract cell complex concept in topology, to precisely express the information content conveyed by the causal states and their relationships. Through this analysis, novel formulations of semantic information, semantic reliability, distortion, and similarity metrics are proposed, which extend beyond Shannon’s concept of uncertainty. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CSC system outperforms conventional wireless and state-of-the-art SC systems by achieving better semantic reliability with reduced bits and enabling better control policies over time thanks to the generative AI architecture.},

  abstract={To predict the oxygen content in flue gas quickly and accurately during the municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI), the dynamic pruning strategy based on mutual information (MI) is used to build a learner model of deep stochastic configuration network (DSCN) in this paper. This learning model consists of two parts. One is to select the characteristic variables of the oxygen content in flue gas through the improved sailfish optimizer (SFO) with t-distribution. The other is to use MI to prune hidden nodes dynamically in a layer-by-layer manner during the training of DSCN, and then obtain a prediction model of the oxygen content in flue gas. The experimental results show that the improved SFO can select the optimal characteristic variables, MI can effectively reduce the complexity of the DSCN after pruning and achieve the rapid and accurate prediction of oxygen content in flue gas, which lays a foundation for timely optimization and adjustment of incineration conditions.},

  abstract={Contrastive learning is a recent hot topic in computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and even a broad perspective of artificial intelligence, which also has obtained increasing attention for self-supervised graph representation learning. However, most graph contrastive learning methods might sub-optimally integrate node features and topological structures in a complex graph with rich information. To address this issue and improve the richness of node representation learned from graphs, we propose a novel contrastive node representation learning in graph via Mutual Channel Distillation(MCD), which utilizes knowledge distillation and multichannel contrastive learning techniques to improve the quality of node embeddings. Our approach applies mutual channel distillation and multi-channel contrastive learning to help the student model and the teacher model learn from each other, allowing for more diversified and informative node representation to be generated. Experimental results demonstrated that MCD yielded competitive performance over baseline models on multiple node classification and clustering benchmark datasets.},

  abstract={The eikonal equation has become an indispensable tool for modeling cardiac electrical activation accurately and efficiently. In principle, by matching clinically recorded and eikonal-based electrocardiograms (ECGs), it is possible to build patient-specific models of cardiac electrophysiology in a purely non-invasive manner. Nonetheless, the fitting procedure remains a challenging task. The present study introduces a novel method, Geodesic- BP, to solve the inverse eikonal problem. Geodesic-BP is well-suited for GPU-accelerated machine learning frameworks, allowing us to optimize the parameters of the eikonal equation to reproduce a given ECG. We show that Geodesic-BP can reconstruct a simulated cardiac activation with high accuracy in a synthetic test case, even in the presence of modeling inaccuracies. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm to a publicly available dataset of a biventricular rabbit model, with promising results. Given the future shift towards personalized medicine, Geodesic-BP has the potential to help in future functionalizations of cardiac models meeting clinical time constraints while maintaining the physiological accuracy of state-ofthe- art cardiac models.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) technologies create digital models of physical entities frequently in multimedia forms, which are crucial for concurrent simulation and analysis of real-world systems. In displaying DTs, Holographic-Type Communication (HTC) provides immersive multimedia access for users to interact with Holographic DTs (HDTs) by transmitting holographic data such as Light Field (LF) and other multisensory information. HDT has applications in remote education, work, and social interactions. However, the effective matching of demand and supply between HDT users and providers remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical architecture that integrates the DT and HTC paradigms. This architecture incorporates a marketplace for HDT services, leveraging a formulated Double Dutch Auction (DDA) mechanism to optimize matching and pricing based on user and provider valuation. Furthermore, We employ an actor-critic-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to train a DDA auctioneer that dynamically adjusts auction clocks during the auction process. As an alternative to the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), we experiment with a Deep Simplistic Variational Quantum Circuit (DSVQC) to reduce the number of parameters and enhance performance stability. Our simulations reveal that the proposed learning-based auctioneer achieves 92% optimal social welfare at a 37% auction information exchange cost for an MLP-based actor and 99% optimal social welfare at a 77% auction information exchange cost for a DSVQC-based actor.},

  abstract={In recent years, deep learning has been widely applied to learning nonlinear dynamic models for the development of a digital twin system. However, most traditional deep learning frameworks, such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and multilayer perceptrons, find it difficult to learn continuous-time and nonlinear system models. To address this challenge, in this paper, a novel deep learning method called neural controlled differential equation has been proposed to model the unknown nonlinear dynamics of controlled continuous-time systems seen in Francis hydroturbines of hydropower systems. Following the development of discretized-model structures for the system using the first principles, a detailed learning algorithm is formulated that is integrated with the physical model of the hydroturbine. As a result, a hybrid modeling with effective learning capability is obtained. To test the effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm, a set of operational data has been collected and used to train the nonlinear dynamics of the Francis hydroturbine, where the learning results of the two nonlinear dynamics, namely the mechanical torque and water flow dynamics, using the real data have indicated that the proposed method can accurately learn these unknown nonlinear dynamics in an online, adaptive way. Moreover, to address the overfitting problem that appears during the online training phase, we propose to apply a meta-learning technique to pre-train a meta-initial value for each parameter of the proposed neural controlled differential equations. It has been shown that the use of the meta-learning technique can reduce the prediction mean square error significantly by more than 60%.},

This limits the reliability and latency performance of C-V2X and hinders transmission scheme optimization. To address this issue, we propose a simple but accurate prediction model to estimates packet reception rate at the transmitter side without requiring additional signaling from the receiver side.

  abstract={With the development of information technology, the next-generation information technologies such as artificial intelligence, digital twin and reconfigurable intelligent surface have become key research areas for current 6G networks. In addition, to improve the end-to-end information processing capability in the next-generation networks and better meet the demand for high-speed communication and high-precision sensing for digital twin, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality immersive services in the 6G networks, integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged. To deal with the conflict between high-quality communication services and low-latency sensing targets in an ISAC architecture, this paper investigates a UAV-assisted ISAC system in which the UAV adopts a flight-hover-communication protocol. In particular, the UAV communicates with Internet of Things (IoT) devices during the hovering period, while it senses the location of targets during the flying period. To maximize the number of connected IoT devices and minimize the energy consumption of the UAV, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based trajectory planning algorithm is designed. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect sensor devices as well as collect sensor data.},

  abstract={In the era of Information and Communication, big data is rapidly generated due to the increasing data-driven applications in Internet of Things (IoT). Effectively processing such data, e.g., knowledge learning, on resource-limited IoT becomes a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a digital twin-enabled IoT, in order to achieve hyper-connected experience, green communication, and sustainable computing. Although knowledge learning benefits from the proposed system, system latency and energy consumption are still our focus in the distributed learning architecture. To this end, we leverage Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to present the deep deterministic policy gradient with double actors and double critics (D4PG) to manage the multi-dimensional resources, i.e., CPU cycles, DT models, and communication bandwidths, enhancing the exploration ability and improving the inaccurate value estimation of agents in continuous action spaces. Extensive experimental results prove that the proposed architecture can efficiently conduct knowledge learning, and our intelligent scheme can effectively improve the system efficiency.},

  abstract={Digital Twin Edge Network (DITEN) is a new paradigm that constructs virtual models for resource allocation, system optimization, and fault prediction through real-time information sharing between physical entities and virtual environments. However, the existing DITEN faces challenges such as high computing requirements and complex network layouts. IRS is a novel type of artificial microstructured material that controls the angle and intensity of signals by manipulating reflecting units. Therefore, we address the limitations of computing capabilities and complex communication environments by incorporating IRS into the construction of DITEN. We get help from IRS to offload training tasks to edge servers at the physical network layer and create digital twin models to capture the real-time state changes of the physical network layer. Furthermore, we formulate a problem aimed at minimizing system latency and propose a federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to jointly optimize the system’s computing resources, offloading coefficients, and reflection link configurations. Experimental results demonstrate the convergence and performance improvements of our proposed algorithm under various scenarios and parameters.},

  abstract={The CPS technology based on the digital twin provides a dynamic and accurate digital model and real-time control of equipment for the construction of the smart grid. However, integrating physical and information sides makes the power grid CPS system vulnerable to attacks from the network and physical sensors, which brings new challenges to communication security. From the perspective of collaborative, secure communication, this paper proposes a secure transmission scheme for power grid CPS based on physical layer security and deep reinforcement learning. Grid transmission nodes select idle trusted devices as relay transmission nodes. Signals are transmitted between nodes through narrow directional beams, which alleviates blocking effects and prevents eavesdroppers from obtaining good eavesdropping capacity. We use the multi-agent dual-dueling deep Q-network algorithm (D3QN) to optimize the selection of cooperative nodes, maximizing the total secrecy ability as the optimization objective. The simulation experiment proves that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the secrecy ability of CPS nodes.},

  abstract={This paper focuses on an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approach for fault localization in a squirrel cage three-phase induction motor (TIM). A multifaceted Digital-Twin (DT) is designed by integrating physics domain knowledge with AI algorithms. The aim is to design a Multiphysics-informed hybrid DT for fault detection and localization in TIM. To achieve this, a high-fidelity computational model of an induction motor is developed using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in COMSOL Multiphysics. The model parameters, loading conditions, and boundary conditions are meticulously tuned with an experimental workbench using a Sparse Nonlinear Optimization (SNOPT) solver. Simulations are conducted to replicate various electrical and mechanical defects. Additionally, the model order reduction technique is employed to generate a reduced state-space model, enabling the high-fidelity dynamic system to act as a virtual sensor exhibiting real-time capabilities. The feature fusion process leverages Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) within the hybrid DT modeling framework. Comparative analysis demonstrates that the Multiphysics-informed hybrid modeling approach enhances the interpretability of AI classifiers, improving real-time condition monitoring and fault localization in TIM.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the issue of high resource consumption in named entity recognition (NER) under large models by utilizing meta-learning and structured distillation to generate lightweight models. Knowledge distillation from commonly used models in NER tasks poses challenges because of the exponentially large output space. Previous work treated it as a structured prediction task for distillation, but did not consider utilizing the feedback from the student model to optimize the student itself. Therefore, this paper proposes Meta-Structured Distillation (MSD). Specifically, this paper incorporates meta-learning into structured distillation, updating the teacher parameters based on the student's performance feedback on the dataset to obtain a better student model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing improvement over previous work in structured distillation.},

  abstract={Change detection and irregular object extraction in 3D point clouds is a challenging task that is of high importance not only for autonomous navigation but also for updating existing digital twin models of various industrial environments. This article proposes an innovative approach for change detection in 3D point clouds using deep learned place recognition descriptors and irregular object extraction based on voxel-to-point comparison. The proposed method first aligns the bi-temporal point clouds using a map-merging algorithm in order to establish a common coordinate frame. Then, it utilizes deep learning techniques to extract robust and discriminative features from the 3D point cloud scans, which are used to detect changes between consecutive point cloud frames and therefore find the changed areas. Finally, the altered areas are sampled and compared between the two time instances to extract any obstructions that caused the area to change. The proposed method was successfully evaluated in real-world field experiments, where it was able to detect different types of changes in 3D point clouds, such as object or muck-pile addition and displacement, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach. The results of this study demonstrate important implications for various applications, including safety and security monitoring in construction sites, mapping and exploration and suggests potential future research directions in this field.},

  pages={1-11},
  abstract={Accurate 3D object segmentation in point clouds is a basis for industrial robot applications, such as robot manipulation and digital twin, which require an understanding of the 3D environment. However, the unstructured and disordered nature of point clouds makes it challenging, especially for the incomplete 3D data under a single view in the real-world scenario. To this end, this paper proposes a novel 3D object segmentation framework (3DT-Seg) based on Cross-Window Point Transformer (CP-Former). CP-Former captures the long-range dependencies between local windows and latent semantic boundaries to enhance the point-wise features extracted from irregular point clouds via a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism. In addition, a contrastive learning loss and an adaptive dual aggregation strategy are introduced on semantic transition regions during the semantic supervising and instance clustering process, respectively. In this way, the latent boundary information is further utilized to improve the overall segmentation performance. Experiments on the popular benchmark (SI3DS) dataset show the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach in terms of semantic and instance segmentation. Furthermore, a real-world point cloud dataset (IP-Cloud) for the robotic grasping task is presented to fully validate the effectiveness of our method in practice, where it also achieves remarkable performance.},

  abstract={Radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) is a remarkable lightweight authentication scheme to support rapid and scalable identification in the internet of things (IoT) systems. Deep learning (DL) is a critical enabler of RFF identification by leveraging the hardware-level features. However, traditional supervised learning methods require huge labeled training samples. Therefore, how to establish a highperformance supervised learning model with few labels under practical application is still challenging. To address this issue, we in this paper propose a novel RFF semi-supervised learning (RFFSSL) model which can obtain a better performance with few meta labels. Specifically, the proposed RFFSSL model is constituted by a teacher-student network, in which the student network learns from the pseudo label predicted by the teacher. Then, the output of the student model will be exploited to improve the performance of teacher among the labeled data. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation on the accuracy is conducted. We derive about 50 GB real long-term evolution (LTE) mobile phone's raw signal datasets, which is used to evaluate various models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RFFSSL scheme can achieve up to 97% experimental testing accuracy over a noisy environment only with 10% labeled samples when training samples equal to 2700.},

  abstract={Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are increasingly significant in modern cities due to their potential to reduce air pollution. Precise and real-time estimation of energy consumption for them is imperative for effective itinerary planning and optimizing vehicle systems, which can reduce driving range anxiety and decrease energy costs. As public awareness of data privacy increases, adopting approaches that safeguard data privacy in the context of BEV energy consumption modeling is crucial. Federated Learning (FL) is a promising solution mitigating the risk of exposing sensitive information to third parties by allowing local data to remain on devices and only sharing model updates with a central server. Our work investigates the potential of using FL methods, such as FedAvg, and FedPer, to improve BEV energy consumption prediction while maintaining user privacy. We conducted experiments using data from 10 BEVs under simulated real-world driving conditions. Our results demonstrate that the FedAvg-LSTM model achieved a reduction of up to 67.84% in the MAE value of the prediction results. Furthermore, we explored various real-world scenarios and discussed how FL methods can be employed in those cases. Our findings show that FL methods can effectively improve the performance of BEV energy consumption prediction while maintaining user privacy.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect novel targets with only a few instances of the associated samples. Although combinations of distillation techniques and meta-learning paradigms have been acknowledged as the primary strategies for FSOD tasks, the existing distillation methods exhibit inherent biases and sensitivity to novel class variability. A critical hurdle for FSOD distillation is the difficulty in ensuring appropriate knowledge learned from the teacher model during the fine-tuning stage. Furthermore, coarse distillation procedures risk misalignment between the learned and actual distributions. This misalignment could potentially negate the benefits of positive cases and impede the detector’s evolution. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel self-distillation paradigm exclusively for the fine-tuning stage (SD-FSOD). Our methods integrate a Distribution Prototype Extractor (DPE) and Self-Distillation Memory (SDM), promoting feature distribution consistency during distillation. In detail, the DPE module reliably initializes the weights of the detector, ensuring a robust class distribution for the distillation process. Meanwhile, the SDM module utilizes decoupling techniques to divide the distillation tasks into two sub-task branches, allowing the student model to independently learn and share precise features through isolated distillation processes. The synergistic integration of feature calibration techniques and the continuous self-distillation paradigm distinctly enhances the fine-tuning process, which shows the superiority of the FSOD self-distillation methodologies. The extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach produces significant improvements and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.},

  abstract={The use of Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) in vehicular networks can lead to better connectivity, reliability, and performance. However, communication in this setting is often done over an unsecured wireless network, which creates a challenge in verifying the validity of received transactions by Internet of Vehicles (IoV) due to the untrusted network. It also creates a potential for attackers to tamper with the data content and conduct different IoV-related attacks. To address these issues, a new framework called “STIoV” has been proposed for secure and trustworthy communication in IoV. The framework includes a mutual authentication scheme to register and exchange session keys among the IoV participants, and a credit-based trust management system to assign reputation scores for the vehicular devices. The latter scheme discards transactions with low credit scores. To overcome the complexity and variability of the IoV network, digital twin technology is used to map Road Side Units (RSU) servers into virtual space, which facilitates constructing the vehicular relation model. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on deep learning techniques is also introduced to detect anomalies in the traffic flow. The legitimate data is further used by the blockchain scheme for transaction verification, block creation and addition. Finally, the proposed framework has been evaluated based on two network intrusion datasets, and the results show the accuracy and efficacy of STIoV in comparison to several recent state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract={Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been one of the common neuromonitoring modalities for real-world brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) because of its non-invasiveness, low cost, and high temporal resolution. In recent years, the emergence of lightweight and portable EEG wearable devices with low-density montages has significantly increased the convenience and usability of BCI applications. However, the use of low-density EEG montages often leads to a loss in EEG decoding performance due to the reduced number of electrodes and limited coverage of scalp regions. To address this issue, we introduce knowledge distillation (KD), a learning mechanism developed for transferring information between neural network models, to enhance the performance of low-density EEG decoding. Our framework includes a newly proposed similarity-keeping (SK) teacher-student KD scheme that allows a low-density EEG student model to acquire the inter-sample similarity from a pre-trained teacher model trained on high-density EEG data. The experimental results validate that our SK-KD framework consistently improves motor-imagery EEG decoding accuracy for low-density EEG data and outperforms other KD methods across various model architectures. As the first KD scheme developed for enhancing EEG decoding, we foresee the proposed SK-KD framework facilitating the practicality of low-density EEG-based BCI in real-world applications.},

  pages={144421-144434},
  abstract={In recent years, most of the research on speech enhancement (SE) has applied different strategies to improve performance through deep neural network models. However, as the performance improves, the memory resources and computational requirements of the model also increase, making it difficult to directly apply them to edge computing. Therefore, various model compression and acceleration techniques are desired. This paper proposes a learning method that dynamically uses Knowledge Distillation (KD) to teach a small student model from a large teacher model by considering the learning ratio from the teacher’s output and the real target based on reinforcement learning (RL). During the KD learning process, RL is adopted to estimate the learning ratio by considering the reward favoring the hard target (clean speech) or the soft target (the output of the teacher model) during the training of KD. The proposed method results in a more stable training process for the resulting smaller SE model and yields improved performance. In the experiment, we used the TIMIT and CSTR VCTK datasets and evaluated two representative SE models that employ different loss functions. On the TIMIT dataset, when we reduced the number of parameters in the Wave-U-Net student model from 10.3 million to 2.6 million, our method performed better than non-KD models with improvements of 0.05 in PESQ, 0.1 in STOI, and 0.47 in the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio. Moreover, by utilizing prior knowledge from the pre-trained teacher model, our method effectively guided the learning process of the student model, achieving excellent performance even under low SNR conditions. Furthermore, we use Conv-Tasnet to further validate our proposed method. Finally, for ease of comparison, we conducted a comparison on the VCTK dataset as well.},

  abstract={There are many important and interesting academic competitions that attract an increasing number of students. However, traditional student team building methods usually have strong randomness or involve only some first-class students. To choose more suitable students to compose a team and improve students’ abilities overall, a competition-oriented student team building method is proposed. This would not only lead to better competition results by choosing more suitable students and teams but also improve the overall involvement of students in considering education fairness. First, a big data platform is constructed to collect students’ various behavior data. Based on that, a competition with a six-tuple attribute and a student with a six-tuple attribute are modeled. Then, a corresponding utility function is designed for each attribute in the student model to denote the student's utility in this attribute for attending a competition. Furthermore, a team utility function is developed for each team to denote the utilities of all involved students. A team building utility function is also developed to denote the utilities of all involved teams. Second, a multiple-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm with dimension by dimension improvement is proposed to build appropriate teams to optimize team building utility maximization and education fairness simultaneously. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that overall performance, not only our proposed team building method has better performance in terms of team utility and student ability than other current methods, but also our proposed multiple-objective optimization algorithm has better performance in terms of hyper volume and inverted generational distance than other optimization algorithms.},

  abstract={This paper describes a study on building a digital twin environment using point cloud data for mobile robots. A digital twin environment for mobile robots is a method to reproduce almost the same environment in a simulation space as if it were a twin, using data from an actual natural environment. In fact, in the development of mobile robots, experiments on public urban area are conducted, however, they are incredibly time-consuming and labor-intensive, so it would be helpful if a realistic simulation environment could be created. This study focuses on building a digital twin environment using point-cloud-data for mobile robots. In order to verify the effectiveness of this approach, we constructed the environment using data from a real mobile robot that has been driven. The navigation of the mobile robot was performed in the constructed simulation environment, and it was possible to realize a navigation run in the driving environment that was almost the same as the run of the real mobile robot.},

  abstract={We introduce a state-of-the-art approach for URL categorization that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address the primary objectives of web content filtering: safeguarding organizations from legal and ethical risks, limiting access to high-risk or suspicious websites, and fostering a secure and professional work environment. Our method utilizes LLMs to generate accurate classifications and then employs established knowledge distillation techniques to create smaller, more specialized student models tailored for web content filtering. Distillation results in a student model with a 9 % accuracy rate improvement in classifying websites, sourced from customer telemetry data collected by a large security vendor, into 30 distinct content categories based on their URLs, surpassing the current state-of-the-art approach. Our student model matches the performance of the teacher LLM with 175 times less parameters, allowing the model to be used for in-line scanning of large volumes of URLs, and requires 3 orders of magnitude less manually labeled training data than the current state-of-the-art approach. Depending on the specific use case, the output generated by our approach can either be directly returned or employed as a pre-filter for more resource-intensive operations involving website images or HTML.},

  abstract={Although desirable, achieving a high-fidelity digital twin of buildings often requires a substantial influx of real-time data, demanding a dense network of environmental sensors. Regrettably, factors such as high hardware expenses, deployment constraints, and sensor malfunctions can impede the realization of such digital twins. In this demonstration, we introduce a pioneering approach that harnesses data-driven virtual sensing within a real-time, high-fidelity 3D digital twin of a building environment. Our innovative method provides accurate machine learning-based inference of real-time sensor variables across both two-dimensional (varying rooms) and three-dimensional (diverse elevations) domains, with limited reliance on physical sensor inputs. Thus, by extending the sensing coverage through the use of ML-driven virtual sensing, we are able to create a more accurate digital twin. Our initial results indicate a mean absolute percentage error of <1 % for temperature and around 10% for air quality parameters such as CO2, when compared against the ground truth physical sensors.},

  abstract={Medical professionals have devised novel solutions to transform the healthcare industry. Modern technology of Digital Twins (DT) can revolutionize medical treatment significantly. DT technology incorporates digitizing physical entities by constantly monitoring their current status. Conspicuously, a state-of-the-art secure framework for monitoring adults’ physical activity is formulated using the culmination of DT technology with IoT-edge computing, and blockchain technology. The presented framework is designed to discreetly secure the health data of the individual. To identify healthcare vulnerabilities in adults, the present study employs deep learning’s ability to analyze IoT data sequentially. Specifically, a deep learning-assisted Multi-Layered Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technique is proposed for real-time vulnerability assessment. Additionally, the proposed framework can protect personal healthcare data by using the blockchain technique. For performance validation, numerous simulations were performed over the challenging data set. Based on the results, the proposed methodology can outperform state-of-the-art techniques by registering enhanced values of Temporal Delay Efficacy (120.79s), Prediction Efficacy (Accuracy (92.24%), Specificity (94.67%), Sensitivity (95.26%), and F-measure (95.69%)), Reliability (91.58%), and Stability (64%).},

  abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of designing incentive mechanisms by a virtual service provider (VSP) to hire sensing IoT devices to sell their sensing data to help creating and rendering the digital copy of the physical world in the Metaverse. Due to the limited bandwidth, we propose to use semantic extraction algorithms to reduce the delivered data by the sensing IoT devices. Nevertheless, mechanisms to hire sensing IoT devices to share their data with the VSP and then deliver the constructed digital twin to the Metaverse users are vulnerable to adverse selection problem. The adverse selection problem, which is caused by information asymmetry between the system entities, becomes harder to solve when the private information of the different entities are multi-dimensional. We propose a novel iterative contract design and use a new variant of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to solve the modelled multi-dimensional contract problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we conduct extensive simulations and measure several key performance metrics of the contract for the Metaverse. Our results show that our designed iterative contract is able to incentivize the participants to interact truthfully, which maximizes the profit of the VSP with minimal individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC) violation rates. Furthermore, the proposed learning-based iterative contract framework has limited access to the private information of the participants, which is to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind in addressing the problem of adverse selection in incentive mechanisms.},

  abstract={Considering the limited resources, user mobility and unpredictable driving environment in intelligent driving, this paper studies the optimal training efficiency of federated learning for distributed training of collision warning services with the assistance of digital twin (DT). DT is emerging as one of the most promising technologies to make the digital representation of physical components for better prediction, analysis, and optimization of various services in intelligent driving. we first propose a DT-enabled collision warning framework, including physical network layer, digital twin layer, and application layer. Then, for the cooperative training of multi-level warning models combining gate recurrent unit (GRU) and support vector machine (SVM) in the digital twin layer, we propose semi-asynchronous federated learning with adaptive adjustment of parameters (SFLAAP) scheme. We aim at minimizing the training delay of collision warning model by dynamically adjusting the training parameters according to real-time training state and resource conditions of digital space, specifically the local training times and the number of local nodes participating in the aggregation, while ensuring the accuracy of the model. Considering the complexity of the target problem, we propose parameter adjustment algorithm based on asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C). Experiments on the classical dataset show high effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Specifically, SFLAAP can reduce the completion time by about 12% and improve the learning accuracy by about 1%, compared with the state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract={Equipping students with hands-on experience and knowledge of robot manipulators is crucial as robotics becomes more applicable in Industry 4.0. However, the practical implementation of physical manipulators in educational settings is challenging due to high capital costs, operational expertise requirements, safety considerations, and remote accessibility. This paper introduces an approach to address these obstacles by implementing a Virtual Reality (VR) platform for studying robot manipulators. The paper details the conceptual methodology, containing five domains: 3D Modelling, Application of Mechanics, VR Development, VR Integration, and Application Development. The methodology shows the creation of three VR applications focusing on distinct learning scenarios. The first application offers an overview of manipulators, while the second illustrates a specific operation (pick-and-place), providing insights into the combined function of links and joints. The third application allows users to interact with the manipulator, facilitating the execution of programming tasks. The paper concludes by outlining the benefits and the features of a VR manipulator over a physical robot manipulator. Then, it outlines the future enhancements, including developing a digital twin for the VR manipulator and a series of laboratory experiments. The study illustrates a crucial step towards broadening the accessibility of robotics education.},

  abstract={In the United Kingdom, industry accounts for roughly a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. The UK Government has set ambitious net-zero targets committed to the decarbonisation of heavy industry, and the Industrial Clusters mission aims to establish the world's first net-zero carbon industrial cluster by 2040. To reduce the energy costs and carbon footprint of industry, one of the most effective solutions is the use of digital tools enabling businesses to monitor and visualize their energy consumption in real-time. Due to recent advancements in industrial digitalization, many industrial sites already generate data, including energy monitoring data, with varying degrees of digital maturity. However, a major challenge with this data is a lack of commercial tools for modeling, predicting, and visualizing industrial manufacturing energy data for efficiency improvement and emissions reduction. This paper describes efforts in a recently funded project to develop a prototype flexible, industrial energy efficiency, and visualization profiling Toolbox (I-CAT). The toolbox embeds energy analytics and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities into an existing commercial SCADA platform for industrial manufacturing operations. This approach allows the creation of an energy Digital Twin. The paper describes requirements of the toolbox, and experimental analysis of the toolbox in a case study, an operational sawmill in Carlisle, UK. Data-driven modeling allows the creation of a predictive model of the energy consumption of the facility from a forecasted production schedule. Mean average modeling errors of less than 10% were obtained. The paper concludes by highlighting areas of future development work.},

  abstract={Online signature verification (OSV) is a standardized personal authentication scheme with wide social acceptance in critical real-time applications include access control, m-commerce, etc. Even though the current advances in Deep learning (DL) technologies catalysed state-of-the-art frameworks for challenging domains like computer vision, speech recognition, etc., the DL-based frameworks are voluminous with huge trainable parameters and are hard to deploy in real-time systems demanding faster inference. To adopt DL into OSV for improved performance, we propose an OSV framework made up of teacher-student collaborative knowledge distillation (TSKD) technique. A heavy Transformer based teacher is trained first and the teacher knowledge is distilled into a very lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based student. A well trained teacher network results in an efficient deep representative feature learning by the student and results in a performance improvement. In a thorough set of experiments with three popular and standard datasets, i.e., the MCYT-100, SUSIG, and SVC, TSOSVNet framework, with a CNN based student model requiring only 3266 trainable parameters results in an EER of 12.42% compared to the recent SOTA 13.38% by a model with 206277 parameters in skilled_01 category of MCYT-100 dataset. In comparison to cutting-edge CNN-based OSV models, the proposed TSOSVNet produced a state-of-the-art EER in the most of the test categories with an average of 90% lesser trainable parameters.},

  abstract={Many practical applications require training of semantic segmentation models on unlabelled datasets and their execution on low-resource hardware. Distillation from a trained source model may represent a solution for the first but does not account for the different distribution of the training data. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques claim to solve the domain shift, but in most cases assume the availability of the source data or an accessible white-box source model, which in practical applications are often unavailable for commercial and/or safety reasons. In this paper, we investigate a more challenging setting in which a lightweight model has to be trained on a target unlabelled dataset for semantic segmentation, under the assumption that we have access only to black-box source model predictions. Our method, named CoRTe, consists of (i) a pseudo-labelling function that extracts reliable knowledge from the black-box source model using its relative confidence, (ii) a pseudo label refinement method to retain and enhance the novel information learned by the student model on the target data, and (iii) a consistent training of the model using the extracted pseudo labels. We benchmark CoRTe on two synthetic-to-real settings, demonstrating remarkable results when using black-box models to transfer knowledge on lightweight models for a target data distribution.},

  abstract={The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones, is expanding quickly across a wide range of industries, such as package delivery, defense, law enforcement, etc. UAVs equipped with machine learning (ML) capabilities can improve system performance by carrying out autonomous actions at the edge, which lowers the need for communication. A prominent area of research addresses the challenge of a UAV equipped with a pre-trained model adapting to rapidly evolving, previously unencountered situations in real-world applications. Such scenarios can arise in situations like emergency deployments of multiple drones with minimal setup time for initial training of the ML models. When the UAV is equipped with sensors that are less sophisticated than those used during the initial training phase, the probability of autonomous operation failure increases. This paper suggests using the Teacher-Student self-training architecture with federated ML capability for a situation involving several heterogeneous UAVs. In this work, we examine a UAV docking scenario where a UAV with a pre-trained model of a docking station is used to teach additional UAVs in real-time in order to show the applicability. The process is done in a distributed framework, where the Teacher and the Student nodes are updated with the newly trained model. The results of our experiments show that our proposed method can improve the performance of the entire system.},

Through this approach, the model is trained to map the network configuration to KPIs in a single forward pass. Hence, it offers a more efficient alternative to traditional simulation-based methods, thus allowing for rapid experimentation and optimization.

  abstract={An efficient deep-detector image quality assessment (EDIQA) is proposed to address the need for an objective and efficient medical image quality assessment without requiring reference images or ground truth scores from expert radiologists. Existing methods encounter limitations in meeting diagnostic quality and computation efficiency, especially when reference images are unavailable. The proposed EDIQA leverages knowledge distillation in a two-stage training procedure, using a task-based image quality assessment (IQA) model and the modified deep-detector IQA (mD2IQA) as the teacher model and novel student model designed for effective learning. This approach enables the student model to compute image scores based on a task-based approach without complex signal insertion and multiple predictions, resulting in a speed improvement of over 1.6e + 4 times compared to the teacher model. A deep learning architecture is developed to allow the student model to learn hierarchical multi scale features of the image from low- to high-level semantic features. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed model across various modalities and anatomical parts, indicating a step toward a universal IQA metric in medical imaging.},

  abstract={Nowadays, intensive interests are targeting the deep learning on edge precision health towards instantaneous disease measurements. However, edge inference usually has constrained computing resource, which poses a great challenge on running the heavy deep learning for real-time measurements. In this study, we propose to leverage a knowledge distillation methodology to enable ultra-efficient deep learning on edge. We take a special interest in Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based cardiac abnormality measurement. More specifically, we propose to train two deep learning models, including a heavy teacher model and a light-weight student model, and leverage the ‘soft target distribution’ learned by the teacher model to supervise the learning of the student model. So, the powerful teacher model can transfer learned knowledge to the student model and boost the latter’s accuracy. Further, to mitigate the vulnerability of the deep learning model under adversarial attacks, we further introduce preserving-robustness learning to the student model, without needing extra computing resources, through enhancing its loss function under adversarial perturbations. Our experiments on real-time heart disease measurement have demonstrated that, the learned lightweight student model, with a model reduction of 45x and under adversarial attacks, can still achieve comparable disease detection performance. The proposed robust knowledge distillation methodology has effectively enabled light-weight and secure cardiac measurement. Significance: This study is expected to contribute to on-edge deep learning-powered disease detection, for real-time, long term, and secured cardiac precision health.},

  abstract={Test certification is an important link during the market-oriented process of C-V2X (Cellular-Vehicle to Everything) technologies. The usual approach, on-road test scenario construction seldom regards the impact of VRU (Vulnerable Road Users) due to the V2P (Vehicle to Pedestrian) communication mode with no definite conclusion. With the development of V2P technologies, VRUs should be considered in test scenario design, and pedestrian-vehicle-oriented scenes are needed. In this paper, we use the genetic algorithm to reconstruct basic pedestrian-vehicle scenarios and use the K-means++ algorithm to sort them according to the critical factors and construct digital twin testing datasets. And after that, we propose a CNN-GRU model to analyze the spatiotemporal features of scenarios and identify the critical pedestrian-vehicle test scenarios. The experimental results show that the pedestrian-vehicle scenario identification precision of the proposed CNN-GRU model is better than that of other algorithms. Pedestrian-vehicle-oriented safety applications can be triggered by the identified scenarios, proving the proposed method’s effectiveness.},

  year={2023},

  pages={253-258},
  abstract={As deep learning technologies, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have advanced, object detection models have become more powerful. This has opened up new possibilities for using cameras to detect fire and smoke for fire warning purposes. However, the high computational demands of deep CNNs make them unsuitable for low computing power devices, which is a challenge for fire detection. A fire detection algorithm based on adaptive region decoupling knowledge distillation has been proposed to address this. Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique that transfers knowledge from a larger, more accurate teacher model to a smaller, less accurate student model. This allows the smaller model to achieve relatively high accuracy using fewer parameters and computational resources. In the proposed approach, the most informative region of the feature map is selected through adaptive region selection, and separate the foreground and background of this region, distilling them with different weights. This approach has been applied to state-of-the-art detectors, and experiments have been conducted on the D-fire dataset. The experiments demonstrate that this approach has improved the AP score from 37.9 to 38.9 for Gfocal with ResNet-50 while training each model for only 12 epochs, especially without incurring any additional cost. Additionally, the proposed approach has achieved similar AP scores as the teacher model but with lower model complexity, fewer parameters, and a faster detection speed of less than 50 milliseconds per image. Specifically, this approach addresses the challenge of deploying such models for fire detection and proposes a promising solution.},

  abstract={To support safety driving and various on-board services, efficient resource allocation is crucial for the promising implement of vehicle platooning in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The resource allocation of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications for vehicular platoons is studied in this paper. First, a multi-objective function is formulated to jointly optimize sub-band and power allocation to satisfy quality-of-service (QoS) in vehicular networks. With the advantage of dealing with complex decision-making problems in multi-agent systems, distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) stands out for resource allocation of vehicular networks. However, it faces the challenge of cooperation ageing when every agent is only learning from information of others to form a cooperation model in the training process. Considering the random and dynamic combination of vehicles in vehicle platooning, a tactic-interactive MADRL method named as TacNet is then proposed to improve the cooperation efficiency of multiple agents. In TacNet, the tactics of other agents will be encoded and transmitted through interactive communications among agents. In addition, with the development of vehicular edge computing (VEC), digital twin (DT) networks are constructed to assist offloading computation-intensive resource allocation tasks in vehicles to the edge. The superiority of the proposed method is verified through extensive simulation results, which refers to convergence and performance of satisfying diversified QoS requirements compared with state-of-the-art MADRL methods.},

  abstract={Massive high-quality annotated data is required by fully-supervised learning, which is difficult to obtain for image segmentation since the pixel-level annotation is expensive, especially for medical image segmentation tasks that need domain knowledge. As an alternative solution, semi-supervised learning (SSL) can effectively alleviate the dependence on the annotated samples by leveraging abundant unlabeled samples. Among the SSL methods, mean-teacher (MT) is the most popular one. However, in MT, teacher model’s weights are completely determined by student model’s weights, which will lead to the training bottleneck at the late training stages. Besides, only pixel-wise consistency is applied for unlabeled data, which ignores the category information and is susceptible to noise. In this paper, we propose a bilateral supervision network with bilateral exponential moving average (bilateral-EMA), named BSNet to overcome these issues. On the one hand, both the student and teacher models are trained on labeled data, and then their weights are updated with the bilateral-EMA, and thus the two models can learn from each other. On the other hand, pseudo labels are used to perform bilateral supervision for unlabeled data. Moreover, for enhancing the supervision, we adopt adversarial learning to enforce the network generate more reliable pseudo labels for unlabeled data. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets to evaluate the proposed BSNet, and results show that BSNet can improve the semi-supervised segmentation performance by a large margin and surpass other state-of-the-art SSL methods.},

  abstract={Accurate modeling of magnetic behaviors, such as the hysteresis loop and core loss, is critical in the design and optimization of power magnetic components. However, these behaviors can be significantly influenced by various factors, such as excitation waveforms and operating conditions, which makes their precise modeling challenging. Neural-network-based power magnetics modeling has emerged as an effective approach for capturing complicated multi-variable non-linearity. This paper uses transformer-based encoder-projector-decoder neural network models to study the material characteristics under ideal excitations, which cannot be done with traditional methods. The neural network model functions as a digital-twin of the original material database with over 10000x smaller data size (e.g., from 3.8 GB to 204 kB) while accurately and rapidly reproducing the material characteristics under complex operating conditions. An online platform – MagNet-AI – is developed as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of using neural networks as the digital-twins to study and compare power magnetics materials.},

  abstract={Nanogrids provide a redundant mode of operation when the grid power fails. Nanogrids use data communication networks to coordinate power and energy between distributed energy resources (DERs). Under the corner-case of simultaneous communication failure and electrical faults, it can be difficult for the energy storage system with grid-forming/grid-following capability to select the correct operational mode. This paper proposes the use of a digital twin to assist in minimizing the degradation on the nanogrid caused by loss of communication during islanded operation under electrical fault conditions. The structure of the digital twin is proposed, and the construction of a virtual twin is presented. The error vector produced by the difference between the physical twin and virtual twin is demonstrated in various fault conditions. Lastly, the paper presents a discussion of how the error vector could be used to make inferences about the nanogrid state and to choose actions during off-nominal communication.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT) models are computational models that can effectively represent different assets and processes in the manufacturing environment. Moreover, the DT models can support intelligent automation by integrating with the digital foundation and the data analytics provided by the cyber-physical system (CPS) in an industrial environment. To properly model a physical process, a DT model should be updated online to closely and timely model the underlying process and reduce modeling uncertainty in the CPS. However, most DT models are created offline and implemented online, which cannot be easily updated by using online data from heterogeneous product designs or manufacturing processes. This limitation arises from existing online learning methods, which are typically designed for identical structures, while real manufacturing CPS involves personalized designs and diverse processes. More importantly, there are limited samples for the same product design or manufacturing process due to manufacturing personalization, which slows down the online updating of DT models. In this article, the authors investigated online DT model updating based on data collected from different product designs and/or processes. The authors proposed a mutual active learning framework to identify informative samples from different designs or processes for online DT model updating. Specifically, by properly balancing the gradient-based features of the DT models and the similarity among these heterogeneous designs or processes, the proposed method can effectively query the most informative samples among heterogeneous processes to update the corresponding DT model in a timely manner. The advantages of the proposed method are illustrated by an engineering-driven statistical DT model for an additive manufacturing process (i.e., fused deposition modeling).},

  abstract={Copy detection patterns (CDP) present an efficient technique for product protection against counterfeiting. However, the complexity of studying CDP production variability often results in time-consuming and costly procedures, limiting CDP scalability. Recent advancements in computer modelling, notably the concept of a “digital twin” for printing-imaging channels, allow for enhanced scalability and the optimization of authentication systems. Yet, the development of an accurate digital twin is far from trivial. This paper extends previous research which modelled a printing-imaging channel using a machine learning-based digital twin for CDP. This model, built upon an information-theoretic framework known as “Turbo”, demonstrated superior performance over traditional generative models such as CycleGAN and pix2pix. However, the emerging field of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) presents a potential advancement in generative models due to its ability to stochastically model the inherent randomness of the printing-imaging process, and its impressive performance in image-to-image translation tasks. This study aims at comparing the capabilities of the Turbo framework and DDPM on the same CDP datasets, with the goal of establishing the real-world benefits of DDPM models for digital twin applications in CDP security. Furthermore, the paper seeks to evaluate the generative potential of the studied models in the context of mobile phone data acquisition. Despite the increased complexity of DDPM methods when compared to traditional approaches, our study highlights their advantages and explores their potential for future applications.},

  abstract={The role of education is of paramount importance in influencing the cognitive development of future generations. This paper presents a novel IoT-based Behavioural Analysis (IoT -BA) Model for Smart Learning integrated with neural network technology. The Internet of Things (IoT) enables educational institutions to perform management tasks more quickly and risk- freely by analyzing organized data and acquiring insights from it to inform decisions. The significance of teaching college students in the self-directed application of effective learning strategies has evolved with various trending digital twin frameworks. The proposed IoT -BA model can collect the motion features and facial expressions of the students from the classroom video while attending classes through self-learning applications. The collected images can then be preprocessed using augmentation and a local binary pattern approach. This deep-preprocessed data has been passed to the deep learning algorithm convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained with the preprocessed data for classification. Spatiotemporal feature extraction and selection from the preprocessed data can be performed using the preprocessing algorithm principal component analysis (PCA). The student's attention level classification for the IoT -BA uses the CNN algorithm. This experimental research uses the real-time data collected by setting the classroom environment for model training and validation. The CNN model has been trained with the data collected from the environment using the simulation platform TensorFlow and performs five-cross-validation with the realistic data. The IoT -BA model can predict the student's attention level in the classroom based on the collected features from the classroom video. The simulation results of the CNN -based IoT -BA model showed better performance in terms of 96.42% classification accuracy and a minimal error rate of 1.82%.},

Based on the scenarios engineering theory, we discuss how to perform interactions between metaverses and the physical world for virtual design instruction and physical validation feedback. Then we introduce a bottomup inspection device development workflow with productivity tools offered by metaverses, making development more effective and efficient than ever. As the core of quality inspection, we propose Quality Transformers to complete detection task, while federated learning is integrated to regulate data sharing.

  abstract={While the industry is exploring the key drivers and future needs of 6G cellular communication systems, 6G research is in full swing, globally supported by large programs. As a result, many new technologies are being proposed. This could be noticed in various fora and publications that convey new visions for the verticals that 6G would serve and the key elements that could make this happen. New radio and optical wireless access technologies for 3D coverage, new waveforms, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), edge–cloud supported by AI, joint communication and sensing, optical fiber networks, nonterrestrial network (NTN) integration, new network architectures, trusted computing platforms, quantum communications, and digital twin provisioning systems are some of many technology enablers for 6G. However, 6G will support many more vertical industries. This requires defining a new model for network infrastructures that builds on 5G architectures and designs, especially private networks and open networking. This means that operating minor networks independently at their local domains and allowing separated domains to handle services without centralized management may become more mainstream. AI and ML will become important enablers for future network management and control. This segregation within the mobile network architecture allows AI-driven components to maximally utilize resources at their local domain. In addition, minor domains would be able to decompose service requests to reduce operational cost incurred by the network. This network modeling takes advantage of fully automated elements and services that could be onboarded upon user demand for more efficient networks that fully utilize resources in a cost-efficient manner. Therefore, operators and vendors need to work closely with network planning engineers and academia to bring such designs into reality.},

  abstract={With the growing maturity of the advanced edge-cloud collaboration and integrated sensing-communication-computing systems, edge intelligence has been envisioned as one of the enabling technologies for ubiquitous and latency-sensitive machine learning based services in future wireless systems. However, with the ever-growing scale of the edge-cloud systems as well as the rapid advances in future 6G technologies, there exists a critical issue that limits the deep penetration of future 6G enabled edge intelligence services, i.e., how to accurately evaluate the performance when leveraging the emerging yet pre-matured technologies, protocols, and algorithms into the existing systems. The recent advanced Digital Twin (DT) has been envisioned to provide a fault-tolerant and low-cost platform for accurately simulating and evaluating the emerging technologies, protocols, and algorithms, without causing any negative influence on the existing systems. The essence of DT aims at enabling a systematic and fully digitalized modeling systems that can produce accurate digital model of the corresponding physical identity in the DT-space. By simulating the digital models in the DT-space, DT can accurately and reliably predict and estimate the dynamics and evolutions of the physical networks during the entire life cycle, thus providing a timely and risk-free methodology for evaluating the performance when adopting the emerging yet pre-matured technologies, protocols, and algorithms for network management. Therefore, DT has been considered as an efficient scheme for addressing the challenging issue to 6G enabled edge intelligence, and thus has attracted lots of interests from both academia and industries. It is observed that DT and edge intelligence can benefit each other, which thus yields a deep convergence of themselves. On the one hand, the increasing network scale, complexity, and security risks of edge intelligence raise more challenges to the security and reliability. DT can accurately simulate and predict the performance of edge intelligence services and thus provide accurate benchmark references for edge services. On the other hand, to enable accurate mapping and real-time synchronization between the physical identifies and their digital models, DT necessitates massive sensing of the targeted physical identifies as well as the consequent data analytics and modeling. Moreover, efficient yet low-latency transmissions of the sensing data and the data analytics (e.g., the inference models) are required. 6G edge intelligence can naturally provide a solution to these requirements. Therefore, this special issue focuses on the convergence of DT and 6G enabled Edge Intelligence, from the perspectives of theories, algorithms, and applications.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is experiencing unimaginable fast booming with the popularization of end devices and advanced machine learning and data processing techniques. An increasing volume of data is being collected every single second to enable Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the Internet of Things (IoT). The explosion of data brings significant benefits to various intelligent industries to provide predictive services and research institutes to advance human knowledge in data-intensive fields. To make the best use of the collected data, various data mining techniques have been deployed to extract data patterns. In classic scenarios, the data collected from IoT devices is directly sent to cloud servers for processing using diverse methods such as training machine learning models. However, the network between cloud servers and massive end devices may not be stable due to irregular bursts of traffic, weather, etc. Therefore, autonomous data mining that is self-organized by a group of local devices to maintain ongoing and robust AI services plays a growing important role for critical IoT infrastructures. Privacy issues become more concerning in this scenario. The data transmitted via autonomous networks are publicly accessible by all internal participants, which increases the risk of exposure. Besides, data mining techniques may reveal sensitive information from the collected data. Various attacks, such as inference attacks, are emerging and evolving to breach sensitive data due to its great financial benefits. Motivated by this, it is essential to devise novel privacy-preserving autonomous data mining solutions for AIoT. In this Special Issue, we aim to gather state-of-art advances in privacy-preserving data mining and autonomous data processing solutions for AIoT. Topics include, but are not limited to, the following: • Privacy-preserving federated learning for AIoT • Differentially private machine learning for AIoT • Personalized privacy-preserving data mining • Decentralized machine learning paradigms for autonomous data mining using blockchain • AI-enhanced edge data mining for AIoT • AI and blockchain empowered privacy-preserving big data analytics for AIoT • Anomaly detection and inference attack defense for AIoT • Privacy protection measurement metrics • Zero trust architectures for privacy protection management • Privacy protection data mining and analysis via blockchain-enabled digital twin.},
