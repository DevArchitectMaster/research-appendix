  abstract={Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) face challenges due to the personalized care required by people with developmental disabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the issues associated with limited staff who are overworked. Such a scenario also disrupted the research and development of socially assistive robots (SARs) as access to care facilities and the elderly was restricted. The restriction sparked creative thinking and innovation aimed at addressing the challenges introduced by the pandemic. Such is the case for developing Aether™, a SAR designed to monitor falls and engage in playful activities with users. This paper presents the use of game technologies to develop a Virtual reality digital twin simulator for overcoming the lack of access to LTCFs and the elderly by creating synthetic data that simulates the robot's behavior, interactions with the environment, and virtual avatars, before its deployment. Our approach additionally allows overcoming the limitation with traditional datasets for training machine learning where depicted people and actions are not representative of the elderly population. Our preliminary results indicate that combining DTs and VR expedites robot development. We tested and compared the robot navigation, person detection, and inspection behavior while observing COVID-19 restrictions.},

  abstract={Assessment is a critical component of any teaching-learning process. It is the only way to gain a better understanding of the knowledge and abilities of the learners, especially in a collaborative learning environment. The learner must pay special attention to interactions and real-world context when selecting collaborative situations and activities. As a result, it is critical to ensure that assessment methods and techniques are adapted so that the learning process is better suited to each group of learners, with their unique learning style, background, needs, previous experiences, and most importantly, context. This paper addressed two major issues in the development of a personalized formative assessment system that will be used to assess the knowledge, skills, and competencies of individual and group learners in an online collaborative learning environment. One approach is to design an adaptive assessment path that helps learners achieve specific learning goals based on previous learner performance, level, and context. The other is to make a personalized recommendation using a Context-Aware Recommender System (CARS), which monitors group formation while performing collaborative assessment activities. To formalize and well define our proposed system, we suggest a semantic web approach using ontologies and eLearning standards, CMI5 to describe the proposed assessment path, and IEEE PAPI for the learner model, all of which allow data reusability and interoperability.},

  abstract={Predicting the evolution of Covid19 pandemic has been a challenge as it is significantly influenced by the characteristics of people, places and localities, dominant virus strains, extent of vaccination, and adherence to pandemic control interventions. Traditional SEIR based analyses help to arrive at a coarse-grained ‘lumped up’ understanding of pandemic evolution which is found wanting to determine locality-specific measures of controlling the pandemic. We comprehend the problem space from system theory perspective to develop a fine-grained simulatable city digital-twin for “in-silico” experimentations to systematically explore - Which indicators influence infection spread to what extent? Which intervention to introduce, and when, to control the pandemic with some a-priori assurance? How best to return to a new normal without compromising individual health safety? This paper presents a digital twin centric simulation-based approach, illustrates it in a real-world context of an Indian City, and summarizes the learning and insights based on this experience.},

  abstract={Technological innovations are expanding rapidly in the public safety sector providing opportunities for more targeted and comprehensive urban crime deterrence and detection. Yet, the spatial dispersion of crimes may vary over time. Therefore, it is unclear whether and how sensors can optimally impact crime rates. We developed a Smart City Digital Twin-based method to dynamically place license plate reader (LPR) sensors and improve their detection and deterrence performance. Utilizing continuously updated crime records, the convolutional long short-term memory algorithm predicted areas crimes were most likely to occur. Then, a Monte Carlo traffic simulation simulated suspect vehicle movements to determine the most likely routes to flee crime scenes. Dynamic LPR placement predictions were made weekly, capturing the spatiotemporal variation in crimes and enhancing LPR performance relative to static placement. We tested the proposed method in Warner Robins, GA, and results support the method's promise in detecting and deterring crime.},

  abstract={The construction industry is struggling with low productivity rates because of a low level of digitalization, dynamic interactions, and uncontrollable circumstances on sites, which make the planning process complex. Usage of the digital twin construction paradigm enables to facilitate construction management and leverage the sector's unexploited potential. This research addresses current shortcomings by real-time discrete event simulation. During crane operations, kinematic data were collected, which were classified by machine learning algorithms for activity recognition and duration extraction. Based on the identified durations, Goodness-of-Fit techniques determined suitable probability density functions. The resulting probability density functions were used as input parameters in stochastic discrete event simulations. It was shown that with enriched data collection, probability density functions have to be updated. The data-driven discrete event simulation facilitates decision-making processes by providing more reliable real-time information for the planning of upcoming construction works. Thus, data-based instead of experience-based management can be enabled.},

Machine learning technology can help to predict properties of innovative compounds and material, but it takes enormous amount of raw data. The implementation of digital twin technology in spectral and molecular dynamics helps to reduce risks introducing the innovations. Large systems technologies are used in multiscale modeling of materials with computer programs. The world experience of chemical data aggregation and storage is based on specialized databases creation. Disunity of data sources demands a single multiscale data model to operate raw data and amend the accuracy of prediction.

  abstract={in order to create a digital twin of the spine to simulate the behavior of the spine after various interventions, the task of automating the marking of the vertebral bodies on radiographs was formulated. The presented work describes the developed approaches to solving the problem of marking the vertebral bodies on radiographs, and also describes algorithms for extracting images of the spine and images of individual vertebrae. For the detection of images of each individual vertebra, the YOLOv5 model was used, and an ensemble of regression models was created to solve the problem of marking the image of each individual vertebra. After a series of experiments, marking errors were estimated at 4.6% using the ratio of coordinates obtained using trained models and correctly marked data. Theories were also put forward about the possible improvement of the created software by dividing the vertebrae into two subclasses in order to reduce the markup error to the desired 0.8%.},

  abstract={This paper presents the results of ongoing work. Today, personalization is one of the main trends in education. Universities collect and analyze data about the students' identity and their needs in order to develop specialized systems that support the personalization of the educational process. The purpose of the current work is to verify the applicability of the "Learner model" that was designed previously. This model is one of the main component of universities' intelligent learning system architecture. This model is based on the results of psychometric test. We increased the sample of students by including new observations and new predictors. Having performed preliminary data preparation, we obtained linear regression models. The results of psychometric tests were used as independent predictors (regressors). We tested students from the 2nd to 4th year of the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Informatics. The dependent variable is the general ECTS score, as well as the average score for the groups of disciplines (mathematical, work-oriented, humanitarian). We compared the resulting models with those obtained using a smaller sample. In general, our conclusion was confirmed.},

  abstract={Machine learning proxy models are often used to speed up or completely replace complex computational models. The greatly reduced and deterministic computational costs enable new use cases such as digital twin control systems and global optimization. The challenge of building these proxy models is generating the training data. A naive uniform sampling of the input space can result in a non-uniform sampling of the output space of a model. This can cause gaps in the training data coverage that can miss finer scale details resulting in poor accuracy. While larger and larger data sets could eventually fill in these gaps, the computational burden of full-scale simulation codes can make this prohibitive. In this paper, we present an adaptive data generation method that utilizes uncertainty estimation to identify regions where training data should be augmented. By targeting data generation to areas of need, representative data sets can be generated efficiently. The effectiveness of this method will be demonstrated on a simple one-dimensional function and a complex multidimensional physics model.},

  abstract={Machine learning algorithms typically assume that the training and test samples come from the same distributions, i.e., in-distribution. However, in open-world scenarios, streaming big data can be Out-Of-Distribution (OOD), rendering these algorithms ineffective. Prior solutions to the OOD challenge seek to identify invariant features across different training domains. The underlying assumption is that these invariant features should also work reasonably well in the unlabeled target domain. By contrast, this work is interested in the domain-specific features that include both invariant features and features unique to the target domain. We propose a simple yet effective approach that relies on correlations in general regardless of whether the features are invariant or not. Our approach uses the most confidently predicted samples identified by an OOD base model (teacher model) to train a new model (student model) that effectively adapts to the target domain. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the performance is improved over the SOTA by ∼10-20%.},

  abstract={Recently Cyber-Physical Systems, Digital Transformation, and Digital Twin have been discussed towards the digitalization of service to people thanks to the integration of information, intelligence, communication, and robot technologies. topological structure is useful to extract features from given or measured big data and to simulate a real-world phenomenon in such a cyber world. Therefore, we proposed the concept of topological twin. The aim of topological twin is to (1) extract topological structures hidden implicitly in the real world, (2) reproduce them explicitly in the cyber world, and (3) simulate and analyze the real world in the cyber world. The topological twin plays the important role in extracting and connecting structures hidden in real world from the mutliscopic point of view. In this talk, we discuss the concept of topological twin for sophisticated service to people in order to bridge the cyber-physical gap from the multiscopic point of view. First, we discuss the role of trailer living laboratory as a new style of smart home in the future society. We can bring the trailer living laboratory to elderly houses, hospitals, and public spaces, and discuss the co-creation towards open innovation using daily life settings with multi-stakeholder approach. Next, we explain various types of topological mapping methods, unsupervised learning methods, and graph-based methods as the methodology of topological intelligence. One of them is Growing Neural Gas (GNG) that can dynamically change the topological structure composed of nodes and edges. We have proposed various types of methods based on multi-scale batch-learning GNG called Fast GNG. Next, we show the comparison result of Fast GNG with other methods. Furthermore, we show several experimental results of multiscopic topological twin in the trailer living laboratory. Finally, we discuss the future direction of researches on the multiscopic topological twin.},

  abstract={We propose an ensemble learning framework with Poisson sub-sampling to effectively train a collection of teacher models to issue some differential privacy (DP) guarantee for training data. Through boosting under DP, a student model derived from the training data suffers little model degradation from the models trained with no privacy protection. Our proposed solution leverages upon two mechanisms, namely: (i) a privacy budget amplification via Poisson sub-sampling to train a target prediction model that requires less noise to achieve a same level of privacy budget, and (ii) a combination of the sub-sampling technique and an ensemble teacher-student learning framework that introduces DP-preserving noise at the output of the teacher models and transfers DP-preserving properties via noisy labels. Privacy-preserving student models are then trained with the noisy labels to learn the knowledge with DP-protection from the teacher model ensemble. Experimental evidences on spoken command recognition and continuous speech recognition of Mandarin speech show that our proposed framework greatly outperforms existing state-of-the-art DP-preserving algorithms in both ASR tasks.},

We propose a framework based on interactive machine learning that could facilitate a continuous biodiversity projection modeling to facilitate incremental learning and reduce uncertainties from the complex factors that contribute to biodiversity declines. The proposed framework exploits digital twin model based on a research forest setting that pioneers this work in Malaysia. The framework comprises of short-term quick wins and long-term expectation of digitalization transformation towards precision biodiversity.},

  abstract={Thereis a paucity of studies on the consumption of digital content by elderly people utilising smart devices as well as strategies to get elderly people acquainted with smart gadgets. Usability and familiarity with smart devices for senior persons to utilise and get the most out of smart devices and digital content must be prioritised. A cognitive reaction-based intelligent UI suited for senior persons is proposed in this paper, which is based on the user's cognitive performance and demographics. A cognitive response feedback and demography dataset was built by interviewing a group of elderly in Malaysia. The context of the interview is associated with the unique cognitive keywords that may be anticipated by contextual semantic search. In this paper, two classifiers are used, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naïve Bayes (NB), and they are compared in terms of classification performances. The classifiers are validated using k-fold cross-validation (to-folds) using unigram TF-IDF and bigram TF-IDF, and the results were presented using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. Thus, user interface (UI) pre-sets lists will be matched to the user model based on the dataset classification result and be visualized using a mobile app interface builder.},

  year={2022},

  pages={837-842},
  abstract={Converting wearable sensor data to actionable health insights has witnessed large interest in recent years. Deep learning methods have been utilized in and have achieved a lot of successes in various applications involving wearables fields. However, wearable sensor data has unique issues related to sensitivity and variability between subjects, and dependency on sampling-rate for analysis. To mitigate these issues, a different type of analysis using topological data analysis has shown promise as well. Topological data analysis (TDA) captures robust features, such as persistence images (PI), in complex data through the persistent homology algorithm, which holds the promise of boosting machine learning performance. However, because of the computational load required by TDA methods for large-scale data, integration and implementation has lagged behind. Further, many applications involving wearables require models to be compact enough to allow deployment on edge-devices. In this context, knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely applied to generate a small model (student model), using a pre-trained high-capacity network (teacher model). In this paper, we propose a new KD strategy using two teacher models - one that uses the raw time-series and another that uses persistence images from the time-series. These two teachers then train a student using KD. In essence, the student learns from heterogeneous teachers providing different knowledge. To consider different properties in features from teachers, we apply an annealing strategy and adaptive temperature in KD. Finally, a robust student model is distilled, which utilizes the time series data only. We find that incorporation of persistence features via second teacher leads to significantly improved performance. This approach provides a unique way of fusing deep-learning with topological features to develop effective models.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose an offline Deep Adaptive Dynamic Programming (DADP) algorithm to improve the real-time performance of trajectory tracking control. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an effective method for solving nonlinear optimal control problems of trajectory tracking, while as an online solution, the processing speed of MPC is too slow to meet the high real-time requirements of automatic driving motion control, especially under long predictive step length. DADP consists of two parts, policy evaluation and policy improvement, where both the policy function and the evaluation function are approximated by neural networks mapping the state of agent to control outputs and value evaluation of the state respectively. Besides, multi-agent parallel training is adopted to speed up the neural network training. The optimal policy function is obtained after the iterations of policy evaluation and policy improvement reach the final equilibrium. Finally, double lane change tracking is performed on the CarSim digital twin platform verifying the high real-time performance of DADP.},

It is of great significance to complete the expansion and optimization of the real world in the virtual environment. So it is inevitable for the meta universe to simulate various real world scenes. It has a wide application prospect to establish virtual images and virtual objects in the simulation scenes of the meta universe, and to drive, interact and optimize them in an intelligent way. The scope of the meta universe is huge, there are many scenes, and the implementation methods are also different. Firstly, this paper gives a basic implementation framework of the mapping of the meta universe to the real scene. On this framework, it takes the meta universe to the industrial scene as the starting point, and simulates the industrial robot as the basic virtual image of the robot in this environment. In the meta universe scene of virtual reality fusion, the motion route of the simulated industrial robot realized by the framework proposed in this paper is optimized by reinforcement learning. This digital twin scene is also of great significance to the path optimization of robots in the world. This framework can be extended to various field scenes of each meta universe to complete the construction of the virtual environment of the meta universe.},

  abstract={Aerial drones come in handy in a variety of science and research applications, sometimes even cause privacy harms during aerial surveillance. In many anti-drone situations, detection, tracking, and classification of drones are of great significance to secure the airspace. Drones are small in size, different in appearance, and have different flight attitudes for various flight environments, which makes the drone data sets too expensive to annotate and the foreground-background imbalance occurs in drone detection. Previous works on drone detection have focused on supervised learning, which depends on large labeled data set. To alleviate the problem of scarce labeled data sets, Semi-Supervised Learning can be employed to leverage unlabeled samples. In this paper, we propose a Semi-Supervised Object Detection method Decoupled Teacher to use unlabeled data and address the foreground-background imbalance issue. Specifically, Decoupled Teacher decouples the Exponential Moving Average mechanism in the general SSOD paradigm, and applies a fusion method of weak/strong data augmentation. We have bench-marked our method and the state-of-the-art SSOD methods using two publicly available drone data sets. The experiment results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Deep Neural Network (DNN) models have brought significant performance gains to machine learning tasks. Nevertheless, the huge storage and computational costs of high-performance models severely limit their deployment on resource-limited embedded devices. Knowledge distillation (KD) is the mainstream approach for models compression, but the existing KD framework has some limitations. First, the student model underperforms when there is a considerable capacity gap between the student and teacher models, which reduces the model compression rate in knowledge distillation. Second, compared with training from scratch, the billions of additional forward propagation of the complex teacher model is time-consuming, resulting longer train time in the distillation process. This paper proposes AKD, an efficient difference-adaptive knowledge distillation framework. AKD consists of two modules. The distillation module uses a modified auxiliary teaching architecture as the backbone, and the adaptive module introduces a difference-adaptive method, which can adjust the teacher model adaptively according to the continuously improving representation ability of the student model. Experimental results on different kinds of datasets and models indicate that AKD not only improves the efficiency of distillation, but also enhances the performance of the compact student model and raise the compression rate.},

  abstract={Personalized news headline generation aims to sum-marize a news article as a news headline, according to the preference of a specific user. It can help users filter their interested news quickly and increase the news click rates for news providers. However, in this field, when learning user interests from their historically clicked news, existing research only learned user interests on word and news level, ignoring sentence level informativeness. This paper proposes a user model, adding sentence-level informativeness to learn user interests, and further guide the news headline generation. To be more detailed, based on attention layers, sentence and news are represented as the weighted sum of word and sentence representations, respectively. To further explore the correlation between different news contents (news title, body, and topic information), the query vectors in the attention layers are replaced by news content. Experiments on the dataset PENS show that the performance of these two models is better than the baseline model on the evaluation metrics ROUGE. Finally, some future directions are discussed, including interactions across informativeness levels and contents.},

  abstract={Building a new-type power system with renewable energy is the key to achieving the target of carbon peak and carbon neutrality, which has been the consensus of the clean, low-carbon, and safe energy transition. The construction of a new-type power system at the industrial park level is the first demonstration of the coordinated optimization and intelligent control of power sources, grid, load, and energy storage to make overall planning to achieve diversified development. To sustain the ‘balance, security, diversity, and low cost’ construction goals of the new-type power system at the park level, the power grid dispatching and control system is transformed to the direction of intelligence and automation, which is reflected in the rapid emergence and construction of complex systems such as digital twin, simulation, reinforcement learning, model training and prediction, and intelligent decision-making of the EMS (Energy Manage System). This brings more complex data sharing, interaction, construction, and other technical requirements than ever before. At the same time, along with the simultaneous construction of new power systems such as micro-grids, virtual power plants, and distributed photovoltaic systems, it has exacerbated the problems of data divergence from business, low data utilization, and centralized architecture brought by the data lakes and data warehouses under the previous monolithic architecture, leading to the data model hard to deploy to meet the demand for efficient collection, interaction, and sharing of scattered and heterogeneous data under the new generation energy structure and greatly increases the work pressure of the data team, making the data team a bottleneck for business applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel design scheme of data processing framework with the data mesh concept, supports the federal computing and analysis engine by building a distributed metadata center, changes the previous centralized data modeling method through data service and productization, realizes data sharing and interaction between complex multi-systems by defining service invocation and encapsulation technology means, improves data utilization, and better supports the automation, rationalization, and balanced construction of the intelligent dispatch system to meet the challenges and requirements brought by the new-type park-level power system.},

  abstract={Although the recent advances in pre-training language models have achieved great success and migrated annotation bottleneck for many tasks, the task-specific fine-tuning for text classification still requires thousands of labeled samples or even more. When few human annotations are available, active self-training is one of the efficient approaches for reducing human annotation costs which integrates pseudo labels of self-training into the procedure of active learning. The traditional active self-training approaches mix manual labels and pseudo labels indistinguishably without considering the impact of active learning and self-training on each other. There are two problems for active self-training in few-shot text classification: (1) The noise in a large number of pseudo-labels may mislead the model training. (2) The confusing samples in overlap boundaries between classes are especially difficult to identify correctly with a few labels. To solve these problems, we propose UCL-AST, an active self-training framework that boosts the performance of the active teacher model to provide superior pseudo labels for the self-training student model and facilitates the active teacher model to learn more clear class boundaries with uncertainty-aware clouded logits in few-shot. The extensive experiments and visualization analysis have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework on four datasets compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Over the last decade, the rapid growth of wind power is driving an increase of efforts in defining the frameworks and rules for the connection of wind power plants (WPPs) through the grid codes and standards, making testing/validation more demanding and complex for wind turbine (WT) manufacturers and WPP developers. Traditionally, WT manufacturers carry out grid compliance tests at full-scale prototype turbines whereas WPP developers and Transmission System Operators (TSOs) mainly perform studies for new WPPs based on offline RMS and EMT simulations. Until now, these strategies have been sufficient for ensuring grid compliance of WTs and WPPs, however moving forward the wind sector needs new testing methods to meet the increasing WT capacity, WPP complexity, and deployment pace to achieve society's desired sustainability targets. In this paper, the emerging strategies that target these challenges are presented as: a) subsystems and component testing of WTs specified in IEC 61400- 21-4; b) - hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) real time simulation for WT/WPP control and protection appraisals (future 61400-21-5). Finally, a future outlook is given on the importance of addressing model validation and how these strategies can be complemented with other modern analytical tools such as artificial intelligence/machine learning, data-driven dynamic modelling, digital twin technology, and software-in-the-loop (SiL) real time simulation.},

To examine the efficiency of the proposed model, we compare its simulation accuracy to a physical based DT, i.e., Single Diode Model (SDM), and data driven DTs, i.e., Support Vector Machines (SVM), Feed Foreword Neural Networks (FFNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Additionally, in terms of data-driven DTs, two different scenarios have been implemented for the selected inputs (solar irradiance and panels' temperature). The results highlight that the proposed model has the highest simulation accuracy, since it leads to lower MAE compared to SDM, while at the same time its accuracy is comparable to the simple LSTM model.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Control valves are integral to the piping infrastructure in most process industries including nuclear, oil and gas, and chemical. They serve as pressure, temperature, and flow rate regulators. Hence detailed information about these parameters within the complex valve shape is particularly useful for design, optimisation, and efficient operation of control valves. For better reliability and operation under safety-critical installations, extensive research is being carried out to develop multi-layer and knowledge-intensive digital twins for such valves. This paper reports a computational investigation to determine the local valve flow coefficient (Cv) at various valve opening positions (VOP)/flow rate conditions and develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the local Cv distribution within the valve-pipe system. This is expected to provide sufficient information to embed extensive knowledge base in the valve’s digital twin. Ten internal locations (at L/D=1 to 10) were chosen for data extraction to give a detailed Cv profile from the pipe inlet through the valve to the pipe outlet. Three VOPs (20, 60, and 100%) were considered and for each, three inlet velocities of 1, 2 and 3 m/s were simulated. This combination resulted in a database of 90 data-points which were used to train the ANN using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. MATLAB’s Neural Network Toolbox was used with 70%, 15%, and 15% of the data used for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Model performance was measured using the mean-square-error and square-of-residuals (R2) metrics. Sensitivity analysis of hidden layer neuron number was conducted, and the results show that 10 neurons produced a robust prediction of the CV profile. An overall average R2 of 0.92 was obtained. Hence, it may be efficiently used for the valve’s internal (rather than global) CV prediction for design and other purposes – including implementation within digital twin architectures for remote/condition monitoring in difficult to reach areas such as offshore and within complex industrial sites.},

  abstract={Open Social Learner Model (OSLM) is a kind of learning models in the field of personalized learning systems. While in traditional personalization systems, student models representing the students’ current states of knowledge are hidden from students and used solely to personalize the educational process, OSLM gives students an opportunity to view, explore, compare peers, and even correct their own knowledge states. In this paper, we propose SmartMe, which is an online learning system for university-level programming algorithm courses, where students can practice exercises to improve their algorithm skills. The questions are presented in the form of multiple-choice questions, which each question links one or more targeted skills. There are two main modules in SmartMe, which are OSLM and case example recommender. The recommender aimed to find case examples based on their similarities with questions and student models. For this study, we applied a cosine similarity algorithm and webbing matrix. To measure the usability of the OSLM and case example recommender, both modules were evaluated by experts and students. The results show that 80.58% of participants found that the combination of OSLM and the case example recommender is useful. Furthermore, the suitability between the recommended case examples and the exercises was 85.86%, based on the expert review.},

  abstract={Coke-oven is not a closed, stable and continuous reaction device in the actual production process. It has periodic operation procedures and the transformation of production rhythm. These factors lead to the strong nonlinear and uncertain characteristics of coke-oven production process. It is difficult to accurately model the gas generation process from the reaction mechanism. In this paper, a digital twin model for forecast of coke-oven gas generationcoke-oven in metallurgical industry based on long short term memory network (LSTM) is proposed. The forecasting models of coke-oven gas based on neural network does not need to study the mechanism of complex chemical reaction. It only needs to determine the correlation characteristics of parameters, and then conduct model training through sufficient historical data, so as to obtain accurate predictive results, which can provide data support for advanced applications such as abnormal working condition early warning and integrated energy management system.},

  abstract={Improving the interactivity and interconnectivity between people is one of the highlights of the Metaverse. The Metaverse relies on a core approach, digital twinning, which is a means to replicate physical world objects, people, actions and scenes onto the virtual world. Being able to access scenes and information associated with the physical world, in the Metaverse in real-time and under mobility, is essential in developing a highly accessible, interactive and interconnective experience for all users. This development allows users from other locations to access high-quality real-world and up-to-date information about events happening in another location, and socialize with others hyper-interactively. Nevertheless, receiving continual, smooth updates generated by others from the Metaverse is a challenging task due to the large data size of the virtual world graphics and the need for low latency transmission. With the development of Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR), users can interact via the Metaverse in a highly interactive manner, even under mobility. Hence in our work, we considered an environment with users in moving Internet of Vehicles (IoV), downloading real-time virtual world updates from Metaverse Service Provider Cell Stations (MSPCSs) via wireless communications. We design an environment with multiple cell stations, where there will be a handover of users' virtual world graphic download tasks between cell stations. As transmission latency is the primary concern in receiving virtual world updates under mobility, our work aims to allocate system resources to minimize the total time taken for users in vehicles to download their virtual world scenes from the cell stations. We utilize a deep reinforcement learning approach and evaluate the performance of the algorithms under different environmental configurations. Our work provides a use case of the Metaverse over AI-enabled 6G wireless communications.},

  abstract={Deep learning-based detection of marine microalgae in natural waters can meet the need for rapid monitoring, facilitating researchers in marine and environmental sciences, while also paving the way for downstream cellular analysis tasks. We use a new training scheme for marine microalgae detection that consists of two phases: a teacher benchmark model phase and a student model learning phase. Using teacher model supervision to get better student model training results. Through a simple and fast image fusion method, we can obtain more realistic algae-generated images to extend the training set and eventually improve the convergence speed and performance of the model. Based on the algorithms of YOLOv5 and YOLOv6, we use the DHLC backbone network fusion method to fuse features from different levels of C3 modules and BepC3 modules together as the input of the PANet middle layer. We also use the module in BoTNet network to obtain stronger feature extraction capability by introducing self-attention mechanism in the yolo model. Since there are many small targets in marine microalgae images, we also extend the YOLOv6l model to the more powerful YOLOv6l-P6 model, which can get better detection results in the input image size of 1280. In addition, we also use time-test augmentation (TTA), weighted boxes fusion (WBF) and Single-class wighted boxes fusion (SinWBF) techniques to optimize the performance of each class. These strategies greatly improve the model detection performance and robustness under the conditions of small amount of marine microalgae microscopic image data. Finally our solution won the first place on the “Vision Meets Algae” Object Detection Challenge, and got 58.25 MAP.},

  abstract={Network Digital Twin is a model that emulates the behavior of a real communication network and is commonly used for prototyping, testing, and network optimization. Utilizing the inherent graph structure in the communication network, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling digital twins of small-scale network. However, they face the challenge of scaling up the GNN model to make predictions on large-scale networks. In this paper, we build a scalable network digital twin capable of predicting the per-path mean delay from traffic and routing configuration on larger topology networks. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of our proposed solutions when modeled using different neural network architectures and combined through various ensemble methods. We explore the performance of GNN models implemented using traditional Artificial Neural Networks and the novel Spiking Neural Network (SNN) techniques. We study the performance of different ensemble weighing techniques such as Averaging, Grid Search, and a Reinforcement Learning(RL)-based weighing technique.

  abstract={The emergence of digital twins provides a new technical means for enabling cyber-physical manufacturing systems. When digital twins are applied in workshops, a major problem is how to use virtual-real mapping to connect the cyber and the physical world to improve decision-making and management in the workshop, to enable the self-adaptive scheduling automation of flexible workshops in multi-disturbance and uncertain production environments. This paper studies the adaptive scheduling of flexible workshops and combines the digital twin technology to establish a digitaltwin-based prototype system of self-adaptive scheduling of flexible workshop. Targeting the real-time and adaptability requirements of workshop scheduling in dynamic production environments, and based on the digital twin environment of workshops, this paper selects the average delivery time of workpieces as the optimization target, and proposes a Deep Q-network (DQN) method driven by the perception-cognitive dual system. The perception system generates workshop states using digital twins and knowledge graphs; the cognitive system abstracts the scheduling process into a process sequencing agent to optimize the completion time, and uses a workshop state matrix to describe the constraints of the problem, introducing order selection and workpiece selection actions step by step into the scheduling decision-making process; then a reward function is designed to evaluate the decision. The superiority of the proposed method is verified by the example verification and algorithm comparison analysis in the sewing workshop of a garment factory.},

  abstract={The IoT devices are widely used in Industrial environment, but usually suffers the resource and energy bottlenecks which may affect the task processing efficiency. Computation offloading is a mechanism to utilize resources well by moving resource-intensive applications from terminal devices to network edge or cloud servers. However, there are still some challenges in applying computation offloading to the Industrial Internet environment due to the complexity and uncertainty of the actual industrial environment. Emerging Digital Twin (DT) is capable of predicting, estimating, and analyzing the real-time state of physical entities and monitoring system environments by creating virtual models of physical entities. Therefore, in this paper, we design a Digital Twin-assisted End-Edge-Cloud collaboration architecture for Industrial Internet (DT-EEC) and propose a computation offloading method based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to minimize the average delay and energy consumption of task processing under this architecture. In addition, we find the extra delay and energy consumption caused by the unreliability of computing nodes are often ignored in previous studies, so the reliability of IoT terminal devices and edge servers are also considered in our computation offloading. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in different scenarios.},

  abstract={UAV-assisted vehicle-edge-computing (VEC) has become a viable solution for a new generation of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and has attracted widespread attention from academia and industry. Compared with fixed ground devices, UAV can provide line-of-sight (LoS) link and has good mobility, which better matches the needs of individual wireless connectivity and high mobility of vehicle. However, the mobility of UAVs leads to dynamic changes in the network topology environment and brings new challenges in the rational path planning of UAVs, which brings new problems for network autonomous decision-making to achieve network resource allocation and load balancing. Therefore, in order to solve above problems, we introduce digital twins-based multi-agent deep Q-network (DT-based MADQN). Digital twin (DT) collects network data and reconstructs the network environment and provides the basis for Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model training. DRL model provides a network decision-making solution based on real-time network status and empirical data. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

  abstract={E-learning proves its importance in the diverse educational levels over traditional education. An adaptive e-learning system needs to deduce the learner model for adding personalization to instructional websites. The learner model is the perception repository about the e-content user, which can be inferred implicitly by employing meaningful semantic analysis of the text. In this research, a novel methodology is proposed to conceptually deduce the semantic learner model for personalized e-learning recommendations. Firstly, Conceptual Learner Model (CLM) is developed based on the learner's behavior and context-based text semantic representation by exploiting concepts from the ConceptNet knowledge base, with a significant association of patterns and rules. Then, Expanded Contextual Learner Model (ECLM) is developed by exploring the latent semantics in graphs to add concepts with the common-sense meanings that exceeded the named entities. The learner's knowledge graph is defined based on contextually associated concepts. Semantic relations in ConceptNet are exploited to extend learner models. The Normalized Particle Swarm Optimization (NPSO) algorithm is used to learn the importance of the relation types between the concepts. Thus, CLM and ECLM each are represented as a vector of weighted concepts in which updating is obtained automatically. The proposed recommendation system incorporates dynamic learner models to predict an appropriate e-content with the highest ranking, matching the true needs of a particular learner. Our simulation results show that the performance of ECLM is better Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) value 0.780 than other existing methods.},

  abstract={Enhancing virtual learning platforms need to adapt new intelligent mechanisms so that long-term learner experience can be improved. Sentiment Analysis gives us perception on how a specific scientific material is suitable to be recommended to the learner. It depends on the feedback of a similar learner taking many factors under consideration such as preference, knowledge level, and learning pattern. In this work, a hybrid e-learning recommendation system is proposed based on individualization and Sentiment Analysis. A new approach is provided for modelling the semantic user model based on the generated semantic matrix to capture the learner's preferences based on their selections of interest. The extracted semantic matrix is used for text representation by utilizing ConceptNet knowledge base which relies on contextual graph and expanded terms to represent the correlation among terms and materials. On the extracted terms from semantic user model, Word Embeddings-Based-Sentiment Analysis (WEBSA) must recommend the learning materials with highest rating to the learners properly. Variant models of (WEBSA) are proposed relying on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate effective vocabulary representations along with the use of qualitative customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for sentiment multi-classification tasks. To validate the language model, two datasets are used, a tailored dataset that has been created by scraping reviews of different e-learning resources, and a public dataset. From the experimental results, it has been found that the lowest error rate is achieved with our customized dataset, where the model named CNN-Specific-Task-CBOWBSA outperforms than others with 89.26% accuracy.},

  abstract={Federated distillation (FD) is a popular novel algorithmic paradigm for Federated learning (FL), which achieves training performance competitive to prior parameter averaging-based methods, while additionally allowing the clients to train different model architectures, by distilling the client predictions on an unlabeled auxiliary set of data into a student model. In this work, we propose FedAUX, an extension to FD, which, under the same set of assumptions, drastically improves the performance by deriving maximum utility from the unlabeled auxiliary data. FedAUX modifies the FD training procedure in two ways: First, unsupervised pre-training on the auxiliary data is performed to find a suitable model initialization for the distributed training. Second,  $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ -differentially private certainty scoring is used to weight the ensemble predictions on the auxiliary data according to the certainty of each client model. Experiments on large-scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer models demonstrate that our proposed method achieves remarkable performance improvements over state-of-the-art FL methods, without adding appreciable computation, communication, or privacy cost. For instance, when training ResNet8 on non-independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) subsets of CIFAR10, FedAUX raises the maximum achieved validation accuracy from 30.4% to 78.1%, further closing the gap to centralized training performance.

  pages={785-795},
  abstract={Nuclei segmentation is an essential step in DNA ploidy analysis by image-based cytometry (DNA-ICM) which is widely used in cytopathology and allows an objective measurement of DNA content (ploidy). The routine fully supervised learning-based method requires often tedious and expensive pixel-wise labels. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised nuclei segmentation framework which exploits only sparsely annotated bounding boxes, without any segmentation labels. The key is to integrate the traditional image segmentation and self-training into fully supervised instance segmentation. We first leverage the traditional segmentation to generate coarse masks for each box-annotated nucleus to supervise the training of a teacher model, which is then responsible for both the refinement of these coarse masks and pseudo labels generation of unlabeled nuclei. These pseudo labels and refined masks along with the original manually annotated bounding boxes jointly supervise the training of student model. Both teacher and student share the same architecture and especially the student is initialized by the teacher. We have extensively evaluated our method with both our DNA-ICM dataset and public cytopathological dataset. Without bells and whistles, our method outperforms all existing weakly supervised entries on both datasets. Code and our DNA-ICM dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/CVIU-CSU/Weakly-Supervised-Nuclei-Segmentation.},

  abstract={Transfer learning is prevalent as a technique to efficiently generate new models (Student models) based on the knowledge transferred from a pre-trained model (Teacher model). However, Teacher models are often publicly available for sharing and reuse, which inevitably introduces vulnerability to trigger severe attacks against transfer learning systems. In this article, we take a first step towards mitigating one of the most advanced misclassification attacks in transfer learning. We design a distilled differentiator via activation-based network pruning to enervate the attack transferability while retaining accuracy. We adopt an ensemble structure from variant differentiators to improve the defence robustness. To avoid the bloated ensemble size during inference, we propose a two-phase defence, in which inference from the Student model is first performed to narrow down the candidate differentiators to be assembled, and later only a small, fixed number of them can be chosen to validate clean or reject adversarial inputs effectively. Our comprehensive evaluations on both large and small image recognition tasks confirm that the Student models with our defence of only 5 differentiators are immune to over 90% of the adversarial inputs with an accuracy loss of less than 10%. Our comparison also demonstrates that our design outperforms prior problematic defences.},

  abstract={The rapid development of digital technology is reshaping the architecture of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The traditional architecture cannot process vast amounts of data exchanges and provide entities with trust. The future IIoT is expected to be a decentralized architecture in which blockchain and digital twin-driven IIoT can enable trusted data exchanges. However, this architecture cannot obtain huge amounts of external real-time data and isolated data. Moreover, it cannot handle complex industrial computing tasks. Therefore, we combine oracle with decentralized learning to propose a novel IIoT-oriented digital twin architecture. We also propose an effective decentralized collaboration mechanism to support external data and resources exchanges. Moreover, we propose a novel computing collaboration mechanism to expand the learning capabilities of the industrial ecology. Experiments show that our proposed paradigm has less processing time, a more stable process, and better learning ability compared to other paradigms.},

  volume={34},

  pages={8743-8752},
  abstract={Existing online knowledge distillation approaches either adopt the student with the best performance or construct an ensemble model for better holistic performance. However, the former strategy ignores other students’ information, while the latter increases the computational complexity during deployment. In this article, we propose a novel method for online knowledge distillation, termed feature fusion and self-distillation (FFSD), which comprises two key components: FFSD, toward solving the above problems in a unified framework. Different from previous works, where all students are treated equally, the proposed FFSD splits them into a leader student set and a common student set. Then, the feature fusion module converts the concatenation of feature maps from all common students into a fused feature map. The fused representation is used to assist the learning of the leader student. To enable the leader student to absorb more diverse information, we design an enhancement strategy to increase the diversity among students. Besides, a self-distillation module is adopted to convert the feature map of deeper layers into a shallower one. Then, the shallower layers are encouraged to mimic the transformed feature maps of the deeper layers, which helps the students to generalize better. After training, we simply adopt the leader student, which achieves superior performance, over the common students, without increasing the storage or inference cost. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of our FFSD over existing works. The code is available at https://github.com/SJLeo/FFSD.},

  abstract={Nowadays, emerging sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile-edge computing (MEC) technologies have played significant roles in developing a sustainable computing network. In sustainable computing networks, with the increasing scale of data-driven applications, massive privacy-sensitive data are generated. How to effectively process such data on resource-limited IoT devices is challenging. Although edge intelligence (EI) is designed to maintain an appropriate level of ultradelay reliability, low-latency communication (URLLC), real-time data processing, and security and privacy are concerning. In this article, we propose a novel blockchain-supported hierarchical digital twin IoT (HDTIoT) framework, which combines the digital twin to edge network and adopts blockchain technology to achieve secure and reliable real-time computation. We first propose a data and knowledge dual-driven learning solution to ensure real-time interaction and efficient optimization between the physical and the digital worlds. To improve communication and computation efficiency with data and knowledge dual-driven learning, the optimization goal is to minimize the system delay and energy consumption and ensure system reliability and the learning accuracy of IoT devices. Moreover, we propose a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm to solve the resource allocation (RA) problem. Experimental results show that the proposed RA scheme can improve the efficiency of the HDTIoT system, guarantee learning accuracy, reliability, and security, and make a balance between system delay and energy consumption.},

  abstract={In this paper, a novel self-adaptive control method based on a digital twin is developed and investigated for a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear system, which is a heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system. For this purpose, hardware-in-loop (HIL) and software-in-loop (SIL) are integrated to develop the digital twin control concept in a straightforward manner. A nonlinear integral backstepping (NIB) model-free control technique is integrated with the HIL (implemented as a physical controller) and SIL (implemented as a virtual controller) controllers to control the HVAC system without the need for dynamic feature identification. The main goal is to design the virtual controller to minimize the distinction between system outputs in the SIL and HIL setups. For this purpose, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is applied to update the NIB controller coefficients of the virtual controller based on the measured data of the physical controller. Since the temperature and humidity of HVAC systems should be regulated, the NIB controllers in the HIL and SIL are designed by the DRL algorithm in a multi-objective scheme (MO). In particular, the simulations of the HIL and SIL environments are coupled by a new advanced tool: function mockup interface (FMI) standard. The Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) is adopted into the FMI interface for data exchange. The extensive research of HIL and SIL controllers shows that the system outputs of the virtual controller are controlled exactly according to the physical controller.},

  volume={22},

  pages={5231-5247},
  abstract={Software-Defined Vehicular Network (SDVN) is a networking architecture that can provide centralized control for vehicular networks. However, the design for routing policies in SDVNs is generally influenced by several limitations, such as frequent topological changes, complex service requests, and long model training time. Intelligent Digital Twin-based Software-Defined Vehicular Networks (IDT-SDVN) can overcome these weaknesses and maximize the advantages of the conventional SDVN architecture by enabling the controller to construct virtual network spaces and provide virtual instances of corresponding physical objects within the Digital Twin (DT). In this paper, we propose a junction-based hierarchical routing scheme in IDT-SDVN, namely, intelligent digital twin hierarchical (ELITE) routing. The proposed scheme is conducted in four phases: policy training and generation in the virtual network, and deployment and relay selection in physical networks. First, the policy learning phase employs several parallel agents in DT networks and derives multiple single-target policies. Second, the generation phase combines the learned policies and generates new policies based on complex communication requirements. Third, the deployment phase selects the most suitable generated policy according to the real-time network status and message types. A road path is calculated by the controller based on the selected policy and then sent to the requester vehicle. Finally, the relay selection phase is utilized to determine relay vehicles in a hop-by-hop process along the selected path. Simulation results demonstrate that ELITE achieves substantial improvements in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and communication overhead compared with its counterparts.},

  abstract={Recent advances in electronic devices and communication infrastructure have revolutionized the traditional healthcare system into a smart healthcare system by using internet of medical things (IoMT) devices. However, due to the centralized training approach of artificial intelligence (AI), mobile and wearable IoMT devices raise privacy issues concerning the information communicated between hospitals and end-users. The information conveyed by the IoMT devices is highly confidential and can be exposed to adversaries. In this regard, federated learning (FL), a distributive AI paradigm, has opened up new opportunities for privacy preservation in IoMT without accessing the confidential data of the participants. Further, FL provides privacy to end-users as only gradients are shared during training. For these specific properties of FL, in this paper, we present privacy-related issues in IoMT. Afterwards, we present the role of FL in IoMT networks for privacy preservation and introduce some advanced FL architectures by incorporating deep reinforcement learning (DRL), digital twin, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for detecting privacy threats. Moreover, we present some practical opportunities for FL in IoMT. In the end, we conclude this survey by discussing open research issues and challenges while using FL in future smart healthcare systems.},

  abstract={Smart home systems are both technologically and economically advancing rapidly. As people become gradually inalienable to smart home infrastructures, their security conditions are getting more and more closely tied to everyone's privacy and safety. In this paper, we consider smart apps, either malicious ones with evil intentions or benign ones with logic errors, that can cause property loss or even physical sufferings to the user when being executed in a smart home environment and interacting with human activities and environmental changes. Unfortunately, current preventive measures rely on permission-based access control, failing to provide ideal protections against such threats due to the nature of their rigid designs. In this paper, we propose CommandFence, a novel digital-twin-based security framework that adopts a fundamentally new concept of protecting the smart home system by letting any sequence of app commands to be executed in a virtual smart home system, in which a deep-q network (DQN) is used to predict if the sequence could lead to a risky consequence. CommandFence is composed of an Interposition Layer to interpose app commands and an Emulation Layer to figure out whether they can cause any risky smart home state if correlating with possible human activities and environmental changes. We fully implemented our CommandFence implementation and tested against 553 official SmartApps on the Samsung SmartThings platform and successfully identified 34 potentially dangerous ones, with 31 of them reported to be problematic Author: Please provide index terms/keywords for your article.

Moreover, We tested our CommandFence on the 10 malicious SmartApps created by Jia et al. 2017, and successfully identified 7 of them as risky, with the missed ones actually only causing smartphone information leak (not harmful to the smart home system). We also tested CommandFence against the 17 benign SmartApps with logic errors developed by Celik et al. 2017, and achieved a 100% accuracy. Our experimental studies indicate that adopting CommandFence incurs a neglectable overhead of 0.1675 seconds.},

  abstract={The rapid expansion of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) necessitates the digitization of industrial processes in order to increase network efficiency. The integration of Digital Twin (DT) with IIoT digitizes physical objects into virtual representations to improve data analytics performance. Nevertheless, DT empowered IIoT generates a massive amount of data that is mostly sent to the cloud or edge servers for real-time analysis. However, unreliable public communication channels and lack of trust among participating entities causes various types of threats and attacks on the ongoing communication. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, we present a blockchain and Deep Learning (DL) integrated framework for delivering decentralized data processing and learning in IIoT network. The framework first present a new DT model that facilitates construction of a virtual environment to simulate and replicate security-critical processes of IIoT. Second, we propose a blockchain-based data transmission scheme that uses smart contracts to ensure integrity and authenticity of data. Finally, the DL scheme is designed to apply the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) against valid data retrieved from blockchain. In DL scheme, a Long Short Term Memory-Sparse AutoEncoder (LSTMSAE) technique is proposed to learn the spatial-temporal representation. The extracted characteristics are further used by the proposed Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) algorithm to learn long-distance features and accurately detect attacks. The practical implementation of our proposed framework proves considerable enhancement of communication security and data privacy in DT empowered IIoT network.},

  abstract={For a complex electromechanical product that is a cyber–physical system (CPS), its dynamic behaviors are embodied in the closed-loop control between the logic process in its cyber component and actual actuators/sensors in its physical component, and thus, a well-defined model of the control is important to create a digital twin that acts as much like the real machine as possible. This article proposes a Petri nets (PNs)-based modeling solution that employs hybrid PNs (HPNs) for physics and system of sequential systems with shared resources (S4R) nets for logic in building a hierarchical control model. We also present PNs technologies for implementing a smooth transition and bidirectional mapping from the virtual prototype to the real machine. These technologies involve a PNs integration of a reinforcement learning (RL) method for generating a workflow scheduling agent in design, an extension of PNs definitions that is compatible with the microcontroller for easy deployment in manufacturing, and an architecture of PNs execution recording for data-driven monitoring in service. A software kit is provided for the solution that includes an integrated development environment of PNs, tools for quickly building a virtual prototype, and a monitor server for remote data-driven monitoring. This solution is successfully applied in the development of a typical cyber–physical product case, namely, the chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) analyzer.},

  abstract={The real-time electrical equipment management, such as renewable energy, controllable loads, and storage units, plays a key role in low-carbon operation of smart industrial park. Digital twin (DT), which explores cloud-edge-device collaboration and artificial intelligence to establish accurate digital representation of physical equipment, is a cutting-edge technology to realize intelligent optimization of electrical equipment management. However, the practical implementation still faces reliability and communication efficiency problems, such as adverse impact of electromagnetic interference on DT reliability, high communication cost of DT model training, and uncoordinated resource allocation among cloud, edge, and device layers. We propose a Cloud-edge-device Collaborative reliable and Communication-efficient DT for lOW-carbon electrical equipment management named $\text{C}^{3}$-FLOW. It minimizes the long-term global loss function and time-average communication cost by jointly optimizing device scheduling, channel allocation, and computational resource allocation.

  title={Ubiquitous Control Over Heterogeneous Vehicles: A Digital Twin Empowered Edge AI Approach}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={30},

  pages={166-173},
  abstract={The forthcoming of automated driving has led to vehicular heterogeneity, where vehicles with different automation levels, including connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and human-driven vehicles (HVs), coexist in the road traffic. However, the design of current traffic control systems fail to account for the vehicular traffic heterogeneity. In addition, the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) based traffic control strategies require large quantities of computation resources and generate high delay, which cannot meet the fault-intolerance requirement of the traffic control system. Therefore, there is an urgent need for constructing a new traffic control framework to jointly satisfy the fault-intolerance requirement and realize ubiquitous control over the heterogeneous vehicles. Inspired by this, a digital twin (DT) empowered edge AI framework is proposed in this article. The DT's virtualization capability is utilized to enable virtual risk assessment and performance analysis under the fault-intolerant traffic control system. In addition, the DT's offline learning capability helps the edge AI understand the road traffic data more intelligently to perform enforced optimizations and decisions. Then, a three-layer vehicle control paradigm is discussed under the proposed framework. In the first layer, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is utilized to intelligently control the CAV acceleration and lane-changing. In the second layer, indirect CV/HV control can be performed by adjusting the target speed and penetration rate of the DRL-controlled CAVs which are mixed in the traffic flow. In the third layer, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications and variable message signs are utilized to realize the direct control of CVs and HVs. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed control paradigm.},

  abstract={Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) means to identify fine-grained aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities. Recent ABSA research focuses on utilizing multi-task learning (MTL) to achieve less computational costs and better performance. However, there are certain limits in MTL-based ABSA. For example, unbalanced labels and sub-task learning difficulties may result in the biases that some labels and sub-tasks are overfitting, while the others are underfitting. To address these issues, inspired by neuro-symbolic learning systems, we propose a meta-based self-training method with a meta-weighter (MSM). We believe that a generalizable model can be achieved by appropriate symbolic representation selection (in-domain knowledge) and effective learning control (regulation) in a neural system. Thus, MSM trains a teacher model to generate in-domain knowledge (e.g., unlabeled data selection and pseudo-label generation), where the generated pseudo-labels are used by a student model for supervised learning. Then, the meta-weighter of MSM is jointly trained with the student model to provide each instance with sub-task-specific weights to coordinate their convergence rates, balancing class labels, and alleviating noise impacts introduced from self-training. The following experiments indicate that MSM can utilize 50% labeled data to achieve comparable results to state-of-arts models in ABSA and outperform them with all labeled data.},

  abstract={With the continuous integration of information technology and operation technology, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is gradually changing from closed to open. Operators can configure, monitor, or control the industrial production process remotely via Internet, which brings security threats to IIoTs. Since the IIoT focuses on the availability of industrial production, it is unfeasible to study security issues directly on the industrial field. Thus, constructing an IIoT cyber range to reproduce industrial scenarios for offensive and defensive confrontation research is necessary. However, the traditional IIoT cyber range relies on physical industrial field devices that are not reproducible and hard to recover from cyber-attacks. To solve these problems, in this article, we propose a framework for a digital twin-based cyber range and a digital twin construction method with multiple models. Cyber ranges with digital twins are more flexible and convenient. Based on the proposed method, an industrial scenario is reproduced using machine learning algorithms to predict temperature changes from different perspectives. The experimental result shows the ability of digital twins to construct an IIoT cyber range to reproduce production processes and replace field devices.},

  abstract={Rapid growth of diversity, uncertainty, and coupling effect of units in modern energy systems jointly challenges the traditional model-based situation awareness (SA) in Energy Internet of Things (EIoT). This work explores the digital twin of EIoT (EIoT-DT) and then provides a novel data-driven SA paradigm, named DT-SA, as a promising alternative. Based on the combination of the latest data technologies and machine learning algorithms, DT-SA transfers those stubborn SA challenges to digital space, and then addresses them by building a domain-specific and data-friendly digital twin (DT) model upon massive data. The established model can be quantitatively tested via iterative virtual–real interaction and, thus, be evaluated and updated through closed-loop feedback to improve its performance in the physical world. To this end, some engineering and scientific problems are raised: 1) virtual–real interaction mechanism relevant to resource flow and data flow; 2) unified modeling and analysis of heterogeneous spatial–temporal data; 3) DT configuration and evolution; and 4) domain-specific DT-SA characterization. To solve these problems, cloud-edge-terminal configuration, big data analytics (BDA), DT, and SA indicator systems are studied, respectively. Then, the random matrix theory (RMT) and overarching DT-SA framework are designed as a roadmap. Besides, some potential applications and undergoing projects on the terminal, edge, or cloud are discussed, e.g., condition assessment of equipment, digital monitoring and diagnosis of the power grid network, and EIoT construction in the smart city. Finally, some perspectives and recommendations are proposed in conclusion for future research. This research can be regarded as an efficient handbook for both energy engineering and data science, which may benefit enterprise digitization, smart city, etc.},

  abstract={Federated learning (FL) allows user devices (UDs) to upload local model parameters to participate in a global model training, which protects UDs' data privacy. Nevertheless, FL still faces challenges such as core network congestion, UDs' limited resources and less efficient mapping between devices and cyber systems. Therefore, in this article, we integrate the digital twin (DT) and the mobile edge computing (MEC) technologies into a hierarchical FL framework in the heterogeneous cellular network scenario. When the UDs are not in the service range of the small base stations (SBSs), the framework allows macro base stations to assist UDs' local computation, thus reducing the transmission delay. It also protects the user privacy and allows more users to join in the training in order to improve the FL accuracy. In addition, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based scheme to solve the joint optimization problem of dynamic UDs-stations association and resource allocation, thereby minimizing the energy consumption within a limited time delay. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme not only effectively reduces the task transmission failure rate and energy consumption compared with the baseline scheme, but also saves the communication cost through the DT network.},

  year={2023},
  volume={72},

  pages={1224-1239},
  abstract={Base stations (BSs) are the most energy-consuming segment of mobile networks. To reduce the energy consumption of BSs, inactive components of BSs, with a certain activation/deactivation time, can sleep. In this study, we model the problem of BS energy saving utilizing multiple sleep modes as a sequential MDP and propose an online traffic-aware deep Q-learning approach to maximize the long-term energy saving. However, there is a risk that BS is not sleeping at the right time and incurs delays to the users. To tackle this issue, we propose to use a digital twin model to encapsulate the dynamics underlying the investigated system and estimate the risk of decision-making (RDM) in advance. We define a novel metric to quantify RDM and predict the performance degradation. Mobile operators can compare the RDM with a tolerable threshold to decide on deactivating SMs, re-training, or activating SMs. We trained an agent using real traffic, obtained from an operator's BS in Stockholm. The data-set contains data rate information with very coarse-grained time granularity. Thus, we propose a scheme to generate a new data-set using the real network data-set which 1) has finer-grained time granularity and 2) considers the bursty behavior of traffic data. Simulation results show that using proposed methods, considerable energy saving is obtained at cost of negligible number of delayed users. Moreover, the proposed digital twin model can predict the performance of the DQN proactively in terms of RDM hence preventing the performance degradation in the network in anomalous situations.},

  year={2023},
  volume={33},
  number={2},
  pages={793-803},
  abstract={A common challenge posed to robust semantic segmentation is the expensive data annotation cost. Existing semi-supervised solutions show great potential for solving this problem. Their key idea is constructing consistency regularization with unsupervised data augmentation from unlabeled data for model training. The perturbations for unlabeled data enable the consistency training loss, which benefits semi-supervised semantic segmentation. However, these perturbations destroy image context and introduce unnatural boundaries, which is harmful for semantic segmentation. Besides, the widely adopted semi-supervised learning framework, i.e. mean-teacher, suffers performance limitation since the student model finally converges to the teacher model. In this paper, first of all, we propose a context friendly differentiable geometric warping to conduct unsupervised data augmentation; secondly, a novel adversarial dual-student framework is proposed to improve the Mean-Teacher from the following two aspects: (1) dual student models are learned independently except for a stabilization constraint to encourage exploiting model diversities; (2) adversarial training scheme is applied to both students and the discriminators are resorted to distinguish reliable pseudo-label of unlabeled data for self-training. Effectiveness is validated via extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2012 and Cityscapes. Our solution significantly improves the performance and state-of-the-art results are achieved on both datasets. Remarkably, compared with fully supervision, our solution achieves comparable mIoU of 73.4% using only 12.5% annotated data on PASCAL VOC2012.

  abstract={The sixth-generation (6G) wireless network is conceptualized to provide ubiquitous and reliable network access through effective inter-networking among space, air, and terrestrial networks, while posing considerable pressure on dynamic network orchestration. Digital twin (DT) provides an alternative approach to proactively make real-time resource allocation by mapping and learning the complex network topology. However, the dual challenges of limited energy capacity and insufficient computing power of unmanned aerial vehicles make it difficult to establish digital twin on aerial networks. In light of this, in this paper, we propose a lightweight DT empowered air-ground network architecture, where the DT modelling task is distributed to diverse ground devices based on federated learning. To improve the efficiency of DT modelling, we design a distributed incentive mechanism that incentivizes high-performance ground devices to take part in federated learning. Considering the computing burden and possible private disclosure caused by the incentive, we further solve the incentive scheme with a new distributed algorithm. The optimal solution, such as the local training rounds and required accuracy of terminal devices, could be calculated in parallel on ground devices. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight DT scheme in terms of energy consumption and model accuracy.},

  title={Simulation Failure-Robust Bayesian Optimization for Data-Driven Parameter Estimation}, 
  year={2023},

  pages={2629-2640},
  abstract={Advances in modeling and computation have resulted in high-fidelity digital twins capable of simulating the dynamics of a wide range of industrial systems. These simulation models often require calibration, or the estimation of an optimal set of parameters in some goodness-of-fit sense, to reflect a system’s observed behavior. While searching over the parameter space is an inevitable part of the calibration process, simulation models are rarely designed to be valid for arbitrarily large parameter spaces. The application of existing calibration methods, therefore, often results in repeated model evaluations using parameters that can cause the simulations to be impractically slow or even result in catastrophic failure. In general, the shape of subregions in the parameter space that could result in simulation failure is unknown. In this article, we propose a novel failure-robust Bayesian optimization (FR-BO) algorithm that learns these failure regions (FRs) from online simulations and informs a Bayesian optimization algorithm to avoid FRs while optimizing model parameters. This results in acceleration of the optimizer’s convergence and prevents wastage of time trying to simulate parameters with high failure probabilities. The effectiveness of the proposed FR-BO algorithm is demonstrated via a well-known benchmark example where we compare against state-of-the-art gradient matching techniques, and a practical example related to parameter estimation for digital twins of buildings.},

  year={2023},
  volume={33},
  number={5},
  pages={2176-2189},
  abstract={Recently, much attention has been paid to segmenting subtle unknown defect regions by knowledge distillation in an unsupervised setting. Most previous studies concentrated on guiding the student network to learn the same representations on the normality, neglecting the different behaviors of the abnormality. This leads to a high probability of false detection of subtle defects. To address such an issue, we propose to push representations on abnormal areas of the teacher and student network as far as possible while pulling representations on normal areas as close as possible. Based on this idea, we design an efficient teacher-student model for anomaly detection and localization, which maximizes pixel-wise discrepancies for anomalous regions approximated by data augmentation and simultaneously minimizes discrepancies for pixel-wise normal regions between these two networks. The explicit differential knowledge distillation enlarges the margin between normal representations and abnormal ones in favour of discriminating them. Then, the appropriate small student network is not only efficient, but more importantly, helps inhibit the generalization ability of anomalous patterns when learning normal patterns, facilitating the precise decision boundary. The experimental results on the MVTec AD, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better performance than current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Especially, For the MVTec AD dataset with high resolution images, we achieve 98.1 AUROC% and 93.6 AUPRO% in anomaly localization, outperforming knowledge distillation based SOTA methods by 1.1 AUROC% and 1.5 AUPRO% with a lightweight model.},

  abstract={Social media sentiment analysis, which aims to evaluate the attitudes of online users based on their posts, has attracted significant research attention due to its successful application in the field of social media monitoring. It is a beneficial way to utilize multimodal information uploaded by users in order to improve sentiment classification ability. However, existing multimodal fusion-based approaches continue to face difficulties due to the issues of between-modality semantic inconsistency and missing modality. To address these issues, we propose a cross-modal consistency modeling-based knowledge distillation framework for image–text sentiment classification of social media data. Specifically, we design a hybrid curriculum learning strategy to measure the semantic consistency of multimodal data, then gradually train all image–text pairs from easy to hard, which can effectively handle the massive amounts of noise caused by inconsistencies between image and text data on social media. Moreover, in order to alleviate the problem of missing images in unimodal posts, we propose a privileged feature distillation method, in which the teacher model additionally considers images as privileged features, to transfer the visual knowledge to the student model, thereby enhancing the accuracy for text sentiment classification. Extensive experiments conducted over three real-world social media datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed multimodal sentiment analysis model.},

  abstract={The sixth generation (6G) wireless communication aims to enable ubiquitous intelligent connectivity in future space–air–ground–ocean-integrated networks, with extremely low latency and enhanced global coverage. However, the explosive growth in Internet of Things devices poses new challenges for smart devices to process the generated tremendous data with limited resources. In 6G networks, conventional mobile edge computing (MEC) systems encounter serious problems to satisfy the requirements of ubiquitous computing and intelligence, with extremely high mobility, resource limitation, and time variability. In this article, we propose the model of wireless computing power networks (WCPNs), by jointly unifying the computing resources from both end devices and MEC servers. Furthermore, we formulate the new problem of task transfer, to optimize the allocation of computation and communication resources in WCPN. The main objective of task transfer is to minimize the execution latency and energy consumption with respect to resource limitations and task requirements. To solve the formulated problem, we propose a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to find the optimal task transfer and resource allocation strategies. The DRL agents collaborate with others to train a global strategy model through the proposed asynchronous federated aggregation scheme. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can improve computation efficiency, speed up convergence rate, and enhance utility performance.},

  abstract={Virtual reality-embedded digital twin (VR-DT) service integrates digital twin with virtual reality to visualize the digital representation of real-world production, boosting the digital transformation of manufacturing industry in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Balanced against the advantages of the VR-DT service, its data-driven, computing-intensive, and security-sensitive features bring challenges to the current IIoT. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based distributed resource allocation scheme to improve the average Quality of Service (QoS) of the VR-DT services with regard to service delay and transaction throughput. We formulate the joint optimization of channel assignment, subframe configuration, computing capacity allocation, and block size adjustment as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. A fully decentralized multiagent compound-action actor–critic algorithm is developed to solve the QoS optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can efficiently improve the average QoS of the VR-DT services in a realizable way as compared to existing schemes.},

  abstract={For prognostics and health management of industrial systems, machine remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is an essential task. While deep learning-based methods have achieved great successes in RUL prediction tasks, large-scale neural networks are still difficult to deploy on edge devices owing to the constraints of memory capacity and computing power. In this article, we propose a lightweight and adaptive knowledge distillation (KD) framework to alleviate this problem. First, multiple teacher models are compressed into a student model through KD to improve the industrial prediction accuracy. Second, a dynamic exiting method is studied to enable an adaptive inference on the distilled student model. Finally, we develop a reparameterization scheme to further lessen the student network. Experiments on two turbofan engine degradation datasets and a bearing degradation dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods and enables the distilled model with an adaptive inference ability.},

  abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the key technology of Industry 4.0. The combination of machine learning and IIoT has spawned a thriving smart industry. Machine learning models are trained and predicted based on raw data that contains sensitive information, and data sharing leads to information leakage. Data security and privacy protection in IIoT face serious challenges. Therefore, we propose a federated learning-based privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme (FLPDA) for IIoT. Data aggregation to protect individual user model changes in federated learning against reverse analysis attacks from industry administration centers. Each round of data aggregation uses the PBFT consensus algorithm to select an IIoT device from the aggregation area as the initialization and aggregation node. Paillier cryptosystem and secret sharing are combined to realize data fault tolerance and secure sharing. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that the scheme can effectively protect data privacy and resist various attacks.

  volume={32},
  number={},
  pages={116-127},
  abstract={While deep models have proved successful in learning rich knowledge from massive well-annotated data, they may pose a privacy leakage risk in practical deployment. It is necessary to find an effective trade-off between high utility and strong privacy. In this work, we propose a discriminative-generative distillation approach to learn privacy-preserving deep models. Our key idea is taking models as bridge to distill knowledge from private data and then transfer it to learn a student network via two streams. First, discriminative stream trains a baseline classifier on private data and an ensemble of teachers on multiple disjoint private subsets, respectively. Then, generative stream takes the classifier as a fixed discriminator and trains a generator in a data-free manner. After that, the generator is used to generate massive synthetic data which are further applied to train a variational autoencoder (VAE). Among these synthetic data, a few of them are fed into the teacher ensemble to query labels via differentially private aggregation, while most of them are embedded to the trained VAE for reconstructing synthetic data. Finally, a semi-supervised student learning is performed to simultaneously handle two tasks: knowledge transfer from the teachers with distillation on few privately labeled synthetic data, and knowledge enhancement with tangent-normal adversarial regularization on many triples of reconstructed synthetic data. In this way, our approach can control query cost over private data and mitigate accuracy degradation in a unified manner, leading to a privacy-preserving student model. Extensive experiments and analysis clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={The sixth generation (6G) is conceived to address the expected high level of requirements (such as ultra-high-data-transmission rate, support for the highest moving speed and seamless connection, etc.) in the next decade and beyond.

However, a large number of IoT devices, the tremendous volume of data, the heterogeneous nature of devices, and the increasing concerns of privacy challenge the efficient management and quality of services in IIoT. To address these problems, in this article, a device-to-device (D2D) communication-aided digital twin edge network is proposed, where edge computing is introduced to bring computing and storage resources near to the end devices, and digital twin is utilized to fill the gap between physical and virtual space and D2D communication is applied to assist resource limited IoT devices to achieve normal communication. Moreover, digital twin-empowered federated reinforcement learning is leveraged to provide privacy awareness and decentralized resource allocation strategy training on D2D communication links to further improve network performance.

In this article, graph digital twin (GDT) is proposed by combining digital twin technology with graph theory, to describe the logical relationships between physical entities more accurately in digital space, and then a novel SA model for IoE based on GDT is proposed. In order to make full use of the relationship between nodes, two classifiers based on graph convolution network are designed for fault location and stability prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed SA model can localize the multiple fault components with high accuracy, and can accurately predict the stability of the system.},

  abstract={Digital twinning and edge computing are attractive solutions to support computing-intensive and service-sensitive Internet of Vehicles applications. Most of the existing Internet of Vehicles service offloading solutions only consider edge-cloud collaboration, but the collaboration between small cell eNodeB (SCeNB) should not be ignored. Service delays far lower than offloading tasks to the cloud can be obtained through reasonable collaborative computing between nodes. The proposed framework realizes and maintains the simulation of collaboration between SCeNB nodes by constructing a digital twin that maintains SCeNB nodes in the central controller, thereby realizing user task offloading positions, sub-channel allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then an algorithm named AUC-AC is proposed, based on the dominant actor-critic network and the auction mechanism. In order to obtain a better command of global information, the convolutional block attention mechanism (CBAM) is used in the digital twin of each SCeNB node to observe its environment and learn strategies. Numerical results show that our experimental scheme is better than several baseline algorithms in terms of service delay.},

More specifically, a real-time general machine-learning-based architecture for sensor validation is proposed, built upon a series of neural-network estimators and a classifier. Estimators correspond to virtual sensors of all unreliable sensors (to reconstruct normal behavior and replace the isolated faulty sensor within the system), whereas the classifier is used for detection and isolation tasks.

  abstract={With the development of IoT, virtual reality, cloud computing, and digital twin technologies, the advent of metaverse has attracted increasing world attention. Metaverse integrates and applies multiple emerging technologies to cloud education, smart health, digital government, and emergency evacuation. Evacuation systems are of great importance to ensure life safety. Due to panic, people in a building may not be able to make the right judgment to choose an optimal path to leave the building in case of an emergency event such as a fire. As a branch of machine learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can model an evacuation scene, collect real-time information, such as crowd distribution and disaster location, find the optimal escape path with a path-planning algorithm, induce the movement state of the crowd through dynamic guidance signs, and improve the evacuation efficiency. In this article, we apply DRL technology to solve the efficient emergency evacuation problem with the help of metaverse and show a training system built upon metaverse that would enable evacuees to choose the most efficient route and leave the building in the least amount of time. The information collected by various sensors, such as video cameras and smoke detectors, can give a whole picture of the status of the building in a real-time manner. The collected data are processed by cloud servers in which a DRL model is trained to dynamically guide evacuees. Experiments in different simulation scenes demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the traditional static guidance method in saving evacuation time. It can effectively avoid major crowding along the evacuation route and improve evacuation efficiency.},

  abstract={Data centres are becoming an increasingly important part of our society’s infrastructure.

But for this, new advanced technologies must be applied to solve the problems of complexity and heterogeneity in various types of data centre design. A new concept, which is based on the automated generation of a digital twin (DT) system, directly from its schematic representation is presented in this paper. A DT is a virtual version of an object or system, designed to aid decision-making and virtual commissioning through simulation, machine learning, and reasoning. In the scope of current work, the IEC 61850 standard is chosen as a starting point for a multi-step generation of the DT combining simulation model and decentralized control logic. As a result, the designed DT “clone” of an electrical system consists of the SIMULINK model of the electrical system plus the automatically generated control application (based on the IEC 61499 standard).},

  abstract={Natural language BERTs are trained with language corpus in a self-supervised manner.

We propose a self-training approach that allows training VL-BERTs from unlabeled image data. The proposed method starts with our unified conditional model– a vision language BERT model that can perform zero-shot conditional generation. Given different conditions, the unified conditional model can generate captions, dense captions, and even questions. We use the labeled image data to train a teacher model and use the trained model to generate pseudo captions on unlabeled image data. We then combine the labeled data and pseudo labeled data to train a student model. The process is iterated by putting the student model as a new teacher. By using the proposed self-training approach and only 300k unlabeled extra data, we are able to get competitive or even better performances compared to the models of similar model size trained with 3 million extra image data.},

  number={},
  pages={1-11},
  abstract={Accurate and robust 6-DOF (6D) pose estimation from a single RGB image and depth map (RGB-D) image is an essential task of intelligent manufacturing, such as robot assembly and digital twin. However, incomplete and noisy 3-D data acquired from depth sensors make the task challenging, especially for various industrial parts without sufficient textures, where the occlusion further exacerbates the problem. To tackle this issue, this article proposes a geometry-enhanced network with incomplete shape recovery (GER-Net) to estimate the 6D pose of industrial parts. First, an incomplete 3-D shape recovery (ISR) module with a learnable shape protection (SP) layer is introduced to recover the complete 3-D geometry shapes of raw point clouds obtained from depth measurements. Subsequently, the multimodal features extracted from raw RGB-D data are enhanced with the geometry information from the recovered point cloud via multiscale concatenation and recurrent forward fusion in the point cloud space. In this way, the enhanced RGB-D representations contribute to the regression of accurate 6D pose. Experiments on two popular benchmark datasets (LineMOD and Occlusion-LineMOD) show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, a real-world low-texture industrial part dataset industrial texture-less machined and 3-D-printed parts (ITM3D) is presented to fully validate the effectiveness of our method, where it also achieves the best performance with remarkable accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract={An efficient serving of predictive management and what-if-analysis of smart cities is the only way to achieve a net-zero waste target. With the aid of the enhanced learning capabilities of digital twin, net-zero aims of smart cities can be obtained with highly accurate results in the prediction of waste-to-energy and candidate truck paths. However, there is no unified communication model yet for a digital twin to maintain complete data and control flow in a fully synchronized way. Without having a clear communication model for the digital twin, the interaction between the physical and digital replica cannot be sustained. To handle this, we propose a digital twin networking framework called T6CONF, based on an IPv6 infrastructure, to solve the end-to-end two-way communication and synchronization problem of the resource-constrained Internet of Things networks. Besides, T6CONF serves two specific net-zero waste services, waste-to-energy and planned-truck-routing prediction services, for the net-zero goal. We evaluate the proposed digital twin communication model with changing fidelity levels over the twinning rate and round-trip time. Additionally, we prove that the proposed T6CONF model increases the accuracy of service layer operations.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) has emerged as an enabling technology for the sixth generation (6G) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. However, there are two crucial issues on leveraging DT for 6G V2X communications. First, what kind of DT capabilities can be combined with the 6G V2X networks? Second, how to transform the DT capabilities into the practical V2X network performance gain? Motivated to solve these problems, this article investigates the DT capabilities under a DT and mobile edge computing empowered 6G V2X network architecture. Specifically, three DT capabilities are presented: (1) Strengthening the human-machine interaction via driving behavior analysis; (2) Improving the traffic safety via knowledge-based vehicle fault diagnosis; (3) Analyzing the spatial-temporal traffic characteristics via data aggregation. Furthermore, we investigate two case studies for illustrating how the DT capabilities can be utilized to perform the task-efficiency oriented V2X network scheduling. In the first case study, the driver behavior analysis result is combined with the V2X channel scheduling strategy. In the second case study, a deep reinforcement learning based vehicle merging decision is devised in the DT domain. Then, a coalition based V2X channel scheduling strategy is proposed to help accomplish the vehicle merging decision task. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed task-efficiency oriented V2X channel scheduling schemes and highlight the future research directions.},

  year={2023},

  pages={7247-7257},
  abstract={To meet the fairly high safety and reliability requirements in practice, the state of health (SOH) estimation of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), which has a close relationship with the degradation performance, has been extensively studied with the widespread applications of various electronics. The conventional SOH estimation approaches with digital twin are end-of-cycle estimation that require the completion of a full charge/discharge cycle to observe the maximum available capacity. However, under dynamic operating conditions with partially discharged data, it is impossible to sense accurate real-time SOH estimation for LIBs. To bridge this research gap, we put forward a digital twin framework to gain the capability of sensing the battery's SOH on the fly, updating the physical battery model. The proposed digital twin solution consists of three core components to enable real-time SOH estimation without requiring a complete discharge. First, to handle the variable training cycling data, the energy discrepancy-aware cycling synchronization is proposed to align cycling data with guaranteeing the same data structure. Second, to explore the temporal importance of different training sampling times, a time-attention SOH estimation model is developed with data encoding to capture the degradation behavior over cycles, excluding adverse influences of unimportant samples. Finally, for online implementation, a similarity analysis-based data reconstruction has been put forward to provide real-time SOH estimation without requiring a full discharge cycle. Through a series of results conducted on a widely used benchmark, the proposed method yields the real-time SOH estimation with errors less than 1$\%$ for most sampling times in ongoing cycles.},

  abstract={Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs), as the crucial support of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), have received great attention in recent years. With the rapid development of VANETs, various services have generated a great deal of data that can be used for transportation planning and safe driving. Especially, with the advent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the transportation system has been impacted, thus novel modes of transportation planning and intelligent applications are necessary. Digital twins can provide powerful support for artificial intelligence applications in Transportation Big Data (TBD). The features of VANETs are varying, which arises the main challenge of digital twins applying in TBD. Network traffic prediction, as part of digital twins, is useful for network management and security in VANETs, such as network planning and anomaly detection. This paper proposes a network traffic prediction algorithm aiming at time-varying traffic flows with a large number of fluctuations. This algorithm combines Deep Q-Learning (DQN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for network traffic feature extraction. DQN is leveraged to carry out network traffic prediction, in which GAN is involved to represent Q-network. Meanwhile, the generative network can increase the number of samples to improve the prediction error. We evaluate the performance of our method by implementing it on three real network traffic data sets. Finally, we compare the two state-of-the-art competing methods with our method.},

  abstract={With the high flexibility of supporting resource-intensive and time-sensitive applications, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) is proposed as an innovational paradigm to support the mobile users (MUs). As a promising technology, digital twin (DT) is capable of timely mapping the physical entities to virtual models, and reflecting the MEC network state in real-time. In this paper, we first propose an MEC network with multiple movable UAVs and one DT-empowered ground base station to enhance the MEC service for MUs. Considering the limited energy resource of both MUs and UAVs, we formulate an online problem of resource scheduling to minimize the weighted energy consumption of them. To tackle the difficulty of the combinational problem, we formulate it as a Markov decision process (MDP) with multiple types of agents. Since the proposed MDP has huge state space and action space, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) with Beta distribution and attention mechanism to pursue the optimal computation offloading policy. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme is able to efficiently reduce the energy consumption and outperforms the benchmarks in performance, convergence speed and utilization of resources.},

  abstract={High-fidelity modeling is of great importance for digital twin (DT) technology. A Transformer-based modeling method for radio over fiber (RoF) link is developed and experimentally demonstrated, in which the Transformer is a kind of deep learning network. The modeling performance of the constructed model by using the proposed method is evaluated, which is better than the ones based on fully connected neural network (FCNN), convolution neural network (CNN), and generative adversarial network (GAN). In addition, the modeling consistency with different laser launch power, fiber length, carrier frequency, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is also investigated. Experimental results show that the fitting waveforms predicted by the proposed method agree well with the actual waveforms at the receiver end. The normalized mean square errors of the fitting waveforms are lower than the acceptable bound of 0.02.},

  title={Instance-Aware Distillation for Efficient Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images}, 
  year={2023},

  pages={1-11},
  abstract={Practical applications ask for object detection models that achieve high performance at low overhead. Knowledge distillation demonstrates favorable potential in this case by transferring knowledge from a cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight student model. However, previous distillation methods are plagued with massive misleading background information in remote sensing images and ignore investigating the relationships between different instances. In this article, we propose an instance-aware distillation (InsDist for short) method to derive efficient remote sensing object detectors. Our InsDist combines feature-based and relation-based knowledge distillation to make the most of instance-related information in the knowledge transfer from the teacher to the student. On one hand, we propose a parameter-free masking module to decouple instance-related foreground from instance-irrelevant background in multiscale features. On the other hand, we construct the relationships between different instances to enhance the learning of intraclass compactness and interclass dispersion. The student comprehensively imitates both features and relationships from the teacher, yielding considerable effectiveness in dealing with complex remote sensing images. In addition, our InsDist can be easily built on mainstream object detectors with negligible extra cost. Extensive experiments on two large-scale remote sensing object detection datasets, namely DIOR and DOTA, show that our InsDist obtains noticeable gains over other distillation methods for both one-stage and two-stage, as well as both anchor-based and anchor-free detectors. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/swift1988/InsDist.},
