  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) is widely used in various industrial sectors to optimize the operations and maintenance of physical assets, system and manufacturing processes. In this paper our goal is to introduce an architecture in which the radio access control happens automatically to minimize the utilized radio resources while still maximizing the production KPIs of the robot cell. To achieve this, we apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a simulated environment to explore the environment fast, while the DT ensures that the learned policy can be applied on the real world environment as well. We show that the application of Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) connection can be reduced to approx. 30% of the total radio time while achieving real-world accurate robot control. The system in action can be seen on [1].},

  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) is a promising technology for in-memory computing with high storage density, fast inference, and good compatibility with CMOS. However, the mapping of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) model on RRAM suffers from realistic device issues, especially the variation and quantization error, resulting in a significant reduction in inference accuracy. In this work, we first extract these statistical properties from 65 nm RRAM data on 300mm wafers. The RRAM data present 10-levels in quantization and 50% variance, resulting in an accuracy drop to 31.76% and 10.49% for MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Based on the experimental data, we propose a combination of machine learning algorithms and on-line adaptation to recover the accuracy with the minimum overhead. The recipe first applies Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer an ideal model into a student model with statistical variations and 10 levels. Furthermore, an on-line sparse adaptation (OSA) method is applied to the DNN model mapped on to the RRAM array. Using importance sampling, OSA adds a small SRAM array that is sparsely connected to the main RRAM array; only this SRAM array is updated to recover the accuracy. As demonstrated on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, a 7.86% area cost is sufficient to achieve baseline accuracy for the 65 nm RRAM devices.},

  abstract={In a world where Artificial Intelligence revolutionizes inference, prediction and decision-making tasks, Digital Twins emerge as game-changing tools. A case in point is the development and optimization of Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITSs): a confluence of cyber-physical digital infrastructure and (semi)automated mobility. Herein we introduce Digital Twin for self-dRiving Intelligent VEhicles (DRIVE). The developed framework tackles shortcomings of traditional vehicular and network simulators. It provides a flexible, modular, and scalable implementation to ensure large-scale, city-wide experimentation with a moderate computational cost. The defining feature of our Digital Twin is a unique architecture allowing for submission of sequential queries, to which the Digital Twin provides instantaneous responses with the "state of the world", and hence is an Oracle. With such bidirectional interaction with external intelligent agents and realistic mobility traces, DRIVE provides the environment for development, training and optimization of Machine Learning based C-ITS solutions.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Internet of things (IoT) devices are prone to attacks due to the limitation of their privacy and security components. These attacks vary from exploiting backdoors to disrupting the communication network of the devices. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play an essential role in ensuring information privacy and security of IoT devices against these attacks. Recently, deep learning-based IDS techniques are becoming more prominent due to their high classification accuracy. However, conventional deep learning techniques jeopardize user privacy due to the transfer of user data to a centralized server. Federated learning (FL) is a popular privacy-preserving decentralized learning method. FL enables training models locally at the edge devices and transferring local models to a centralized server instead of transferring sensitive data. Nevertheless, FL can suffer from reverse engineering ML attacks that can learn information about the user's data from model. To overcome the problem of reverse engineering, mimic learning is another way to preserve the privacy of ML-based IDS. In mimic learning, a student model is trained with the public dataset, which is labeled with the teacher model that is trained by sensitive user data. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines the advantages of FL and mimic learning, namely federated mimic learning to create a distributed IDS while minimizing the risk of jeopardizing users' privacy, and benchmark its performance compared to other ML-based IDS techniques using NSL-KDD dataset. Our results show that we can achieve 98.11% detection accuracy with federated mimic learning.},

  abstract={As a key service of the future 6G network, healthcare digital twin is the virtual replica of a person, which employs Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and AI-powered models to predict the state of health and provide suggestions to a range of clinical questions. To support healthcare digital twins, the right cyber resilience technologies and policies must be applied and maintained to preserve cyber resilience. Vulnerability detection is a fundamental technology for cyber resilience in healthcare digital twins. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been applied to address the limitations of traditional machine learning in vulnerability detection. However, it is important to consider code context relationships and pay attention on the vulnerability related keywords for searching an IoT vulnerability in healthcare digital twins. Due to massive software and complexity of healthcare digital twin, a full automatic solution is really needed for assisting cyber resilience check in the real-world scenarios. This article presents a novel scheme for recognising potential vulnerable functions to support healthcare digital twins. We develop a new deep neural model to capture bi-directional context relationships among the risky code keywords. A number of well-designed experiments are carried out on a large ground truth, which consists of tens of thousands of vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions from IoT related software. The results show our new scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art DL-based methods for vulnerability detection.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Vienna, among other cities, has the aspirations of transforming into a smart city of tomorrow. To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of the derived models for thermal rating calculation are indicated by comparison to the analytical method given by the IEC 60287 on an example. Accurate mathematical models with real time calculation capabilities and prediction accuracies in the range of 98 to 99% could be derived on the basis of relatively small data sets and implementation of external data.},

  abstract={The hammering sound inspection for pieces plays the Digital Twin part in the Hybrid Twin approach. The map generated by Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm makes it possible to cluster the pieces into defected and non-defected groups by checking the corresponding hammering sounds. However, the applicability of map generated by SOM has not yet been discussed. This paper suggests a procedure how to improve a map generated by SOM algorithm. It shows that if the hammering sound of a piece is mapped on the boundary between the areas corresponding to defected and non-defected products, the map cannot be applied to inspect this piece and another map must be generated by repeating the training including the hammering sounds of such pieces by SOM algorithm. By executing the procedure some number of times, it is likely that the improved map will be used for hammering sound inspection.},

In its autonomous operating, the length estimation of lawn grasses or of such ground conditions as dirt, gravel, or concrete, etc., are important for precisely controlling the rotation speed of motor and moreover, the estimation must be fast. Therefore, an SNN is constructed, and its performances are compared with those of random forest algorithm through some experiments. The accuracy of SNN is 0.7 point better than that of random forest algorithm and the training time is very fast, that is, less than 0.4 seconds. The SNN is being further improved from the view point of application range and performances.},

  abstract={This paper states an estimation method for lawn grass lengths or ground conditions based on random forest algorithm. This relates to Digital Twin and Virtual Twin of Hybrid Twin approach. Recently, the robotic lawn mowers are becoming popular with the advent of efficient sensors and embedded systems. However, the length of lawn grasses or such ground conditions as dirt, gravel, or concrete, etc., are not recognized. As a result, the motor for cutting lawn grasses is running with constant rotation speed from the beginning to the end of operation of robotic lawn mower. In order to precisely control the rotation speed of motor, the lawn grass lengths and ground conditions are estimated by using the effective sensor data. By applying the random forest algorithm, the combination of sensing parameters attained more than 90% correct estimation ratio is shown through some experiments. Now, the suggested algorithm and the sensor fusion are evaluated against wide range of lawn and grounds.},

  title={Weakly Supervised Cross-Domain Mixed Dish Detection With Mean-Teacher}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={201236-201246},
  abstract={Mixed dish, which mixes different types of dishes in one plate, is a popular kind of food in East and Southeast Asia. Identifying the dish type in the mixed dish is essential for dietary tracking, which gains increasing research attention recently. Nevertheless, mixed dish detection is a challenging task because of large visual variances among dishes in different canteens, which is known as the domain shifting problem. Since collecting and annotating sufficient training samples in each canteen for model training is difficult, a more practical way is developing detection models that can adapt quickly to cross-canteen mixed-dish detection with less supervision information. To this end, we propose a novel framework called Weakly-supervised Mean Teacher Network (WMT-Net) that addresses this specific detection task in a weakly supervised manner, where bounding box annotations are not required in the target domain. The proposed WMT-Net constructs Mean Teacher learning by maintaining the image-level consistency between teacher and student modules. Specifically, WMT-Net firstly learns instance-level information from the source dataset in a fully supervised fashion for the student model. Then the whole architecture is optimized with weakly supervised learning: 1) weakly supervised training in student model to reduce the domain gap in global semantics between source data and target data, 2) image-level consistency to align the image-level predictions between teacher model and student model. Experimental results on mixed-dish dataset show that even the proposed WMT-Net is trained in a weakly supervised fashion on the target domain, the performances attained by WMT-Net are very close to the model trained in a fully supervised fashion, which verify the effectiveness of WMT-Net. In addition, the proposed WMT-Net also achieves 44.6% mAP on Pascal VOC to Clipart cross-domain detection, which improves 7.2% mAP compared with the state-of-the-arts method and further demonstrates its generalization capabilities.},

Decisions are taken in the high layer of the MES based on real time machine learning algorithms that predict resource performances and QoS influencing usage costs, classify and cluster resource states to predict anomalies in behaviours and prevent resource failures. The distributed control layer keeps reality awareness during production by using digital twins replicated for all resources. Data is collected in real time streams from physical resource and process twins, aggregated in time series and sent to the intelligent agents in the cloud without delaying production.

This paper presents a virtual commissioning digital twin model for the modularized automatic assembly system running in our lab. First, the Siemens NX MCD software tool is used to develop the virtual commissioning digital twin model for the system. Then the different working scenarios are simulated and implemented in the virtual physical simulation environment. The data from the proposed virtual commissioning digital twin model is collected and trained with 6 different machine learning algorithm such as Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The advantage of our newly developed virtual commissioning model is that it is able to simulate different working conditions without risk and cost-free. It is also convenient to mimic the worsening working status and failed operation scenarios which need long time to collect for the real system. We use the collected data as input for the machine learning to implement the system monitoring and predicting. The machine learning results for 6 learning algorithms are presented and it shows the possibilities and advantages of our proposed virtual commissioning digital twin model.},

  abstract={Cyber-physical systems revolve around context awareness, empowering objective-oriented services, products and operations based on real data. Self-aware and self-control systems are core elements in the Industry 4.0 framework towards self-sustainable adaptive manufacturing and personalized services. This development is witnessed by the context-aware pervasive assistance to users and machines in decisions making process for optimizing product performance and economic yield. While integration of the virtual and the physical world entails smart sensors communication and complex data analytics, it relies on artificial intelligence tools to manage process operations. The objective of the article is to create awareness that systems & control community must address theoretical and practical aspects from a larger perspective. Context aware control is emerging as a natural solution to maximize the use of available sensing instrumentation and the relatively low cost data logging, i.e. an important source for extracting information, interpreting and using context information and adapt its functionality to the current context of use.

  abstract={This paper presents the details of our solution for the mask sub-task of the INTERSPEECH 2020 Computational Para-linguistics Challenge (ComParE). The speech production can be significantly affected when the speaker wears a face mask. The task evaluates the systems for the classification of speech recordings with and without a surgical mask. A student-teacher deep-learning neural network is proposed inspired by the well-performed consistency learning method on a lot of classification problems. In particular, the consistency regularization term is designed between out-puts of the student model and the guided teacher model. Different level Gaussian noises are respectively added into the inputs of the teacher model as model perturbations to optimize the system robustness. To take further advantage of the consistency learning, a small number of unlabeled evaluation data is utilized to be combined with the labeled data for the system training in a semi-supervised learning manner. Finally, the proposed system achieves an unweighted average recall up to 72.50% on the official evaluation dataset, increasing by 10% compared with the baseline result of 62.60%.},

  abstract={The massive penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and high speed power electronics, even at the distribution grid edge, increases the management and operational complexity of the network while necessitates predictive maintenance, control and failure prediction mechanisms in near real time. A distribution subsystem comprises a CPS (Cyber Physical System) where the Cyber part is enabled by a low latency IIoT network and computational resources at the edge (distribution grid subsystem controller) while the physical system is represented (Digital Twin) by a hybrid model of the grid: a data driven machine learning representation of a limited number of nodes, along with a discrete-time model-based transient state estimator which captures the near real time physical operation of the grid. In case of early warning measurements acquired through the IIoT, machine learning edge computations can detect the severity of the warning, identify the network area of interest while ignite the execution of the transient state estimation. The transient state estimation predicts the incoming failure in near real time while the timing window allows possible preventive actuation.},

  abstract={Agriculture needs to optimization for satisfying the rising demands of food due to world population growth. An approach to this problem is digitization of agriculture through IT tools by creating digital twins. However, in the digital twin creation the uniqueness of the plant is lost, therefore, plant based agricultural cultivation cannot be performed. Hence, this paper proposes a methodology to assign an identification marker to plants in a crop using an image analysis pipeline. To show the effectiveness of the algorithm the proposed method is evaluated on the Rovitis robotic platform and compared with the crop ontology. The outcome of this work can be used in robotic agricultural platforms to address plants singularly thus optimizing their cultivation.},

  abstract={To reduce the number of aircrafts on ground, the electrical design engineers are interested in predicting the oil temperature of the generator during a flight. Changes on the temperature value may indicate an incorrect functioning of the generator. An abnormal behavior can be identified by using machine learning algorithms trained on flights free from any anomalies to predict the generator oil temperature. These predictions can then be compared to the observed values, here the sensor data collected from the aircraft during flight. If the observed value is far from the predicted value, a failure warning is raised and a maintenance action shall be performed.In this paper, we build a digital twin of the electrical generator which predicts the oil generator temperature at a given time thanks to the history of features. We compare several machine learning algorithms and the most promising appears to be a neural network which was implemented as part of the electrical generator digital twin.The digital twin is tested by using real flight data containing generator failures and it is verified that the algorithm is able to detect an anomaly prior to the failure events (early failure detection).},

  abstract={Knowledge Distillation is one approach in Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to compress huge parameters and high level of computation associated with a teacher model to a smaller student model. Therefore, the smaller model can be deployed in embedded systems. Most of Knowledge Distillations transfer information at the last stage of the DNN model. We propose an efficient compression method that can be split into three parts. First, we propose a cross-layer Gramian matrix to extract more features from the teacher's model. Second, we adopt Kullback Leibler (KL) Divergence in an offline deep mutual learning (DML) environment to make the student model find a wider robust minimum. Finally, we propose the use of offline ensemble pre-trained teachers to teach a student model. With ResNet-32 as the teacher's model and ResNet-8 as the student's model, experimental results showed that Top-l accuracy increased by 4.38% with a 6. 11x compression rate and 5. 27x computation rate.},

  abstract={The complexity of global distribution networks in the automotive industry and likewise the number of disruptions significantly increased throughout the last years. In order to monitor relevant processes and to optimize decision-making in case of disruptions, a concept for a decision support system (DSS) was introduced. For this purpose, the distribution process weaknesses of the German premium automotive company BMW were identified. The method used was a Failure Mode and Effect Analysis with operational managers and relevant process partners interviews. Based on the findings, performance indicators, thresholds, early warnings and options for action were specified. A big data platform supports the processing of the growing number of relevant data in real-time. In the long-term decision-making can be automated using machine learning algorithms. This paper proves that negative impacts of disruptions can be minimized, and the robustness of the process improved by anticipating and identifying deviations beforehand and in real-time. Hence, companies save money while strengthening customer satisfaction. The DSS can be seen as a necessary precursor of a digital twin.},

This paper presents the development and implementation of a bi-directional digital twin application in an Industry 4 testing laboratory at University of South Australia. The solution is based on the establishment of OPC UA connection between two cobots of different brands, the use of NX Siemens as a CAD simulation platform and a SCADA system from Inductive Automation.

  abstract={We train a unified model to perform three tasks: facial action unit detection, expression classification, and valence-arousal estimation. We address two main challenges of learning the three tasks. First, most existing datasets are highly imbalanced. Second, most existing datasets do not contain labels for all three tasks. To tackle the first challenge, we apply data balancing techniques to experimental datasets. To tackle the second challenge, we propose an algorithm for the multitask model to learn from missing (incomplete) labels. This algorithm has two steps. We first train a teacher model to perform all three tasks, where each instance is trained by the ground truth label of its corresponding task. Secondly, we refer to the outputs of the teacher model as the soft labels. We use the soft labels and the ground truth to train the student model. We find that most of the student models outperform their teacher model on all the three tasks. Finally, we use model ensembling to boost performance further on the three tasks.

  abstract={Like the current digitalization process [1], digitalization in the Smart Home and Smart Building goes beyond seeing digital systems as individual elements or isolated solutions. In principle, solutions must be developed that enable comprehensive networking and barrier-free data exchange to support the numerous new application scenarios [2]. Nowadays, in a typical smart home, there exist a large number of miscellaneous devices and systems with different characteristics. Using their sensors and actuators, these devices and systems can form an interface to the real world and can make their measurements available in near real time. Furthermore, it is possible to provide a digital representation of an entire Smart Home or Building using a socalled Digital Twin. Digital Twins can not only represent the current state of the underlying systems, but also the history of the data for learning processes in a semantic context. Hence, they can provide interfaces to AI systems in a service environment. In this paper, we present an approach which uses the WoT Thing Description (TD) as standardized by the W3C [3] as the basis for the implementation of a novel Digital Twin for Smart Homes and Buildings. The use of the standardized TD model enables interoperability across manufacturers and devices. The goal is to make extended services more flexible and dynamic on the basis of semantic device type and building descriptions of Digital Twins.},

  abstract={Relevance has significant impact on user experience and business profit for e-commerce search platform. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for search relevance prediction, by distilling knowledge from BERT and related multi-layer Transformer teacher models into simple feed-forward networks with large amount of unlabeled data. The distillation process produces a student model that recovers more than 97% test accuracy of teacher models on new queries, at a serving cost that's several magnitude lower (latency 150x lower than BERT-Base and 15x lower than the most efficient BERT variant, TinyBERT). The applications of temperature rescaling and teacher model stacking further boost model accuracy, without increasing the student model complexity. We present experimental results on both in-house e-commerce search relevance data as well as a public data set on sentiment analysis from the GLUE benchmark. The latter takes advantage of another related public data set of much larger scale, while disregarding its potentially noisy labels. Embedding analysis and case study on the in-house data further highlight the strength of the resulting model. By making the data processing and model training source code public, we hope the techniques presented here can help reduce energy consumption of the state of the art Transformer models and also level the playing field for small organizations lacking access to cutting edge machine learning hardwares.},

  abstract={Data-efficient domain adaptation with only a few labelled data is desired for many robotic applications, e.g., in grasping detection, the inference skill learned from a grasping dataset is not universal enough to directly apply on various other daily/industrial applications. This paper presents an approach enabling the easy domain adaptation through a novel grasping detection network with confidence-driven semi-supervised learning, where these two components deeply interact with each other. The proposed grasping detection network specially provides a prediction uncertainty estimation mechanism by leveraging on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), and the mean-teacher semi-supervised learning utilizes such uncertainty information to emphasizing the consistency loss only for those unlabelled data with high confidence, which we referred it as the confidence-driven mean teacher. This approach largely prevents the student model to learn the incorrect/harmful information from the consistency loss, which speeds up the learning progress and improves the model accuracy. Our results show that the proposed network can achieve high success rate on the Cornell grasping dataset, and for domain adaptation with very limited data, the confidence- driven mean teacher outperforms the original mean teacher and direct training by more than 10% in evaluation loss especially for avoiding the overfitting and model diverging.},

  abstract={In this study, we present a dynamic graph representation learning model on weighted graphs to accurately predict the network capacity of connections between viewers in a live video streaming event. We propose EGAD, a neural network architecture to capture the graph evolution by introducing a self-attention mechanism on the weights between consecutive graph convolutional networks. In addition, we account for the fact that neural architectures require a huge amount of parameters to train, thus increasing the online inference latency and negatively influencing the user experience in a live video streaming event. To address the problem of the high online inference of a vast number of parameters, we propose a knowledge distillation strategy. In particular, we design a distillation loss function, aiming to first pretrain a teacher model on offline data, and then transfer the knowledge from the teacher to a smaller student model with less parameters. We evaluate our proposed model on the link prediction task on three real-world datasets, generated by live video streaming events. The events lasted 80 minutes and each viewer exploited the distribution solution provided by the company Hive Streaming AB. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of link prediction accuracy and number of required parameters, when evaluated against state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we study the distillation performance of the proposed model in terms of compression ratio for different distillation strategies, where we show that the proposed model can achieve a compression ratio up to 15:100, preserving high link prediction accuracy.

  abstract={Deep learning models trained on large-scale data have achieved encouraging performance in many real-world tasks. Meanwhile, publishing those models trained on sensitive datasets, such as medical records, could pose serious privacy concerns. To counter these issues, one of the current state-of-the-art approaches is Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles, or PATE, which achieved promising results in preserving the utility of the model while providing a strong privacy guarantee. PATE combines an ensemble of "teacher models" trained on sensitive data and transfers the knowledge to a "student" model through the noisy aggregation of teachers' votes for labeling unlabeled public data which the student model will be trained on. However, the knowledge or voted labels learned by the student are noisy due to private aggregation. Learning directly from noisy labels can significantly impact the accuracy of the student model. In this paper, we propose the PATE++ mechanism, which combines the current advanced noisy label training mechanisms co-teaching(+) with the original PATE framework to enhance its accuracy. A novel structure of Generative Adversarial Nets with one generator and two discriminators is developed in order to integrate them effectively. Furthermore, we discuss the intrinsic limitations of the "update-by-disagreement" method in the co-teaching+ mechanism and develop a novel noisy label detection mechanism for semi-supervised model training to further improve student model performance when training with noisy labels. We evaluate our method on Fashion-MNIST and SVHN to show the improvements on the original PATE on all measures.},

However, the underlying neural architectures require a large amount of parameters to train and suffer from high online inference latency, that is several model parameters have to be updated when new data arrive online. In this study we propose Distill2Vec, a knowledge distillation strategy to train a compact model with a low number of trainable parameters, so as to reduce the latency of online inference and maintain the model accuracy high. We design a distillation loss function based on Kullback-Leibler divergence to transfer the acquired knowledge from a teacher model trained on offline data, to a small-size student model for online data. Our experiments with publicly available datasets show the superiority of our proposed model over several state-of-the-art approaches with relative gains up to 5% in the link prediction task. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our knowledge distillation strategy, in terms of number of required parameters, where Distill2Vec achieves a compression ratio up to 7:100 when compared with baseline approaches. For reproduction purposes, our implementation is publicly available at https://stefanosantaris.github.io/Distill2Vec.},

  abstract={With the passage of the 2018 U.S. Farm Bill, Industrial Hemp production is moved from limited pilot programs to a regulated agriculture production system. However, Industrial Hemp Supply Chain (IHSC) faces critical challenges, including high complexity and variability, very limited production knowledge, and lack of data/information tracking. In this paper, we propose blockchain-enabled IHSC and develop a preliminary simulation-based digital twin for this distributed cyber-physical system (CPS) to support the process learning and risk management. Basically, we develop a two-layer blockchain with proof of authority smart contract, which can track the data and key information, improve the supply chain transparency, and leverage local authorities and state regulators to ensure the quality control verification. Then, we introduce a simulation-based digital twin for IHSC management, which can characterize the process spatial-temporal causal interdependencies and dynamic evolution to guide risk control and decision making.

  abstract={With more and more data collected in the offshore platform production, the application of digital twins (DT) in the power grid can realize the data feedback to the digital model concurrently, and realize a high degree of uniformity between the prediction model and the actual physical system based on the exchange of data. On this basis, an accurate digital modeling description of the actual physical process can be accomplished, so that the load can be optimized and scheduled more accurately. In this paper, a micro grid of oilfield platforms is taken as the research object. The load forecasting, fault analysis and power system optimization of offshore oilfield platforms is hard in traditional models. This paper uses the (phasor measurement unit) PMU for situation awareness and update actual time data thus the digital model can receive feedback from actual situation. A DT model based on data collected and uploaded by sensors and the PMU is proposed as a digital model on the cloud. On this basis, this loop forms an adaptive and self-learning system which can minimize the forecast error and obtain better optimization. The DT model can make the design and update of offshore oilfield platforms power system easier, as well as cut down the cost of optimization.},

  year={2021},
  volume={43},

  pages={786-797},
  abstract={Knowledge distillation aims to train a student (model) for accurate inference in a resource-constrained environment. Traditionally, the student is trained by a high-capacity teacher (model) whose training is resource-intensive. The student trained this way is suboptimal because it is difficult to learn the real data distribution from the teacher. To address this issue, we propose to train the student against a discriminator in a minimax game. Such a minimax game has an issue that it can take an excessively long time for the training to converge. To address this issue, we propose adversarial distillation consisting of a student, a teacher, and a discriminator. The discriminator is now a multi-class classifier that distinguishes among the real data, the student, and the teacher. The student and the teacher aim to fool the discriminator via adversarial losses, while they learn from each other via distillation losses. By optimizing the adversarial and the distillation losses simultaneously, the student and the teacher can learn the real data distribution. To accelerate the training, we propose to obtain low-variance gradient updates from the discriminator using a Gumbel-Softmax trick. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed adversarial distillation under both accuracy and training speed.},

  pages={837-852},
  abstract={Large scale 3D maps constructed via LiDAR sensor are widely used on intelligent vehicles for localization in outdoor scenes. However, loading, communication and processing of the original dense maps are time consuming for onboard computing platform, which calls for a more concise representation of maps to reduce the complexity but keep the performance of localization. In this paper, we propose a teacher-student learning paradigm to compress the 3D point cloud map. Specifically, we first find a subset of LiDAR points with high number of observations to preserve the localization performance, which is regarded as the teacher of map compression. An efficient optimization strategy is proposed to deal with the massive data in original map. With the supervision of compressed map, a student model is built by training a random forest model fed with geometric feature descriptors of each point. As a result, the student model is able to compress the map without referring to the expensive numerical optimization. Additionally, by incorporating the features, the innovative student model can be generalized to other new maps while no re-training is required. We conduct thorough experiments on multi-session dataset and KITTI dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed learning paradigm, and the comparison with other map compression methods. The final results show that the learned student model can achieve efficient map compression with comparable LiDAR based localization performance to the original map at the same time.},

  pages={1354-1366},
  abstract={In this work, we develop a joint sample discovery and iterative model evolution method for semi-supervised learning on very small labeled training sets. We propose a master-teacher-student model framework to provide multi-layer guidance during the model evolution process with multiple iterations and generations. The teacher model is constructed by performing an exponential moving average of the student models obtained from past training steps. The master network combines the knowledge of the student and teacher models with additional access to newly discovered samples. The master and teacher models are then used to guide the training of the student network by enforcing the consistency between their predictions of unlabeled samples and evolve all models when more and more samples are discovered. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the process of discovering confident samples from the unlabeled dataset, once coupled with the master-teacher-student network evolution, can significantly improve the overall semi-supervised learning performance. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with a small set of 250 labeled samples, our method achieves an error rate of 11.58%, more than 38% lower than Mean-Teacher (49.91%). When coupled with the MixMatch augmentation and loss function, the improvements are also significant.},

  abstract={Knowledge-transfer (KT) methods allow for transferring the knowledge contained in a large deep learning model into a more lightweight and faster model. However, the vast majority of existing KT approaches are designed to handle mainly classification and detection tasks. This limits their performance on other tasks, such as representation/metric learning. To overcome this limitation, a novel probabilistic KT (PKT) method is proposed in this article. PKT is capable of transferring the knowledge into a smaller student model by keeping as much information as possible, as expressed through the teacher model. The ability of the proposed method to use different kernels for estimating the probability distribution of the teacher and student models, along with the different divergence metrics that can be used for transferring the knowledge, allows for easily adapting the proposed method to different applications. PKT outperforms several existing state-of-the-art KT techniques, while it is capable of providing new insights into KT by enabling several novel applications, as it is demonstrated through extensive experiments on several challenging data sets.},

  pages={523-534},
  abstract={A common shortfall of supervised deep learning for medical imaging is the lack of labeled data, which is often expensive and time consuming to collect. This article presents a new semisupervised method for medical image segmentation, where the network is optimized by a weighted combination of a common supervised loss only for the labeled inputs and a regularization loss for both the labeled and unlabeled data. To utilize the unlabeled data, our method encourages consistent predictions of the network-in-training for the same input under different perturbations. With the semisupervised segmentation tasks, we introduce a transformation-consistent strategy in the self-ensembling model to enhance the regularization effect for pixel-level predictions. To further improve the regularization effects, we extend the transformation in a more generalized form including scaling and optimize the consistency loss with a teacher model, which is an averaging of the student model weights. We extensively validated the proposed semisupervised method on three typical yet challenging medical image segmentation tasks: 1) skin lesion segmentation from dermoscopy images in the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2017 data set; 2) optic disk (OD) segmentation from fundus images in the Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge (REFUGE) data set; and 3) liver segmentation from volumetric CT scans in the Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS) data set. Compared with state-of-the-art, our method shows superior performance on the challenging 2-D/3-D medical images, demonstrating the effectiveness of our semisupervised method for medical image segmentation.},

  abstract={The rapid development of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) requires industrial production towards digitalization to improve network efficiency. Digital Twin is a promising technology to empower the digital transformation of IIoT by creating virtual models of physical objects. However, the provision of network efficiency in IIoT is very challenging due to resource-constrained devices, stochastic tasks, and resources heterogeneity. Distributed resources in IIoT networks can be efficiently exploited through computation offloading to reduce energy consumption while enhancing data processing efficiency. In this article, we first propose a new paradigm digital twin network to build network topology and the stochastic task arrival model in IIoT systems. Then, we formulate the stochastic computation offloading and resource allocation problem to minimize the long-term energy efficiency. As the formulated problem is a stochastic programming problem, we leverage Lyapunov optimization technique to transform the original problem into a deterministic per-time slot problem. Finally, we present asynchronous actor-critic algorithm to find the optimal stochastic computation offloading policy.

  abstract={The continuously growing amount of monitored data in the Industry 4.0 context requires strong and reliable anomaly detection techniques. The advancement of Digital Twin technologies allows for realistic simulations of complex machinery; therefore, it is ideally suited to generate synthetic datasets for the use in anomaly detection approaches when compared to actual measurement data. In this article, we present novel weakly supervised approaches to anomaly detection for industrial settings. The approaches make use of a Digital Twin to generate a training dataset, which simulates the normal operation of the machinery, along with a small set of labeled anomalous measurement from the real machinery. In particular, we introduce a clustering-based approach, called cluster centers (CC), and a neural architecture based on the Siamese Autoencoders (SAE), which are tailored for weakly supervised settings with very few labeled data samples. The performance of the proposed methods is compared against various state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms on an application to a real-world dataset from a facility monitoring system, by using a multitude of performance measures. Also, the influence of hyperparameters related to feature extraction and network architecture is investigated. We find that the proposed SAE-based solutions outperform state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches very robustly for many different hyperparameter settings on all performance measures.},

  pages={2771-2782},
  abstract={Annotation scarcity is a long-standing problem in medical image analysis area. To efficiently leverage limited annotations, abundant unlabeled data are additionally exploited in semi-supervised learning, while well-established cross-modality data are investigated in domain adaptation. In this paper, we aim to explore the feasibility of concurrently leveraging both unlabeled data and cross-modality data for annotation-efficient cardiac segmentation. To this end, we propose a cutting-edge semi-supervised domain adaptation framework, namely Dual-Teacher++. Besides directly learning from limited labeled target domain data (e.g., CT) via a student model adopted by previous literature, we design novel dual teacher models, including an inter-domain teacher model to explore cross-modality priors from source domain (e.g., MR) and an intra-domain teacher model to investigate the knowledge beneath unlabeled target domain. In this way, the dual teacher models would transfer acquired inter- and intra-domain knowledge to the student model for further integration and exploitation. Moreover, to encourag reliable dual-domain knowledge transfer, we enhance the inter-domain knowledge transfer on the samples with higher similarity to target domain after appearance alignment, and also strengthen intra-domain knowledge transfer of unlabeled target data with higher prediction confidence. In this way, the student model can obtain reliable dual-domain knowledge and yield improved performance on target domain data. We extensively evaluated the feasibility of our method on the MM-WHS 2017 challenge dataset. The experiments have demonstrated the superiority of our framework over other semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation methods. Moreover, our performance gains could be yielded in bidirections, i.e., adapting from MR to CT, and from CT to MR. Our code will be available at https://github.com/kli-lalala/Dual-Teacher-.},

  pages={3444-3455},
  abstract={In this work, we propose to push the performance limit of semi-supervised learning on very small sets of labeled samples by developing a new method called learned model composition with critical sample look-ahead (LMCS). Training efficient deep neural networks on much smaller sets of labeled samples is a challenging problem. With a small labeled set, the initial network suffers from low accuracy. Based on this error-prone network, the subsequent semi-supervised learning process will be fragile and unstable. To address this issue, we propose to introduce a look-ahead master model to identify the correct direction of model evolution to effectively guide the semi-supervised learning process of the student model. Specifically, our proposed LMCS method explores two major ideas. First, it introduces a new learned model composition structure so that we can compose a more efficient master network from student models of past iterations through a network learning process. Second, we develop a new method, called confined maximum entropy search, to discover new critical samples near the model decision boundary and provide the master model with look-ahead access to these samples to enhance its guidance capability. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LMCS method outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods, especially on small sets of labeled samples. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with a very small set of 80 labeled samples, our method outperforms Google’s MixMatch method, reducing the error rate by more than 10%.},

  title={Toward Intelligent Cooperation of UAV Swarms: When Machine Learning Meets Digital Twin}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={35},
  number={1},
  pages={386-392},
  abstract={With high mobility, low cost and outstanding maneuverability properties, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm has attracted worldwide attentions in both academia and industry. Nevertheless, the complex and coherent characteristics of the intelligent cooperation of UAV swarm greatly restrict its wide application. The recent development of artificial intelligence provides new methodologies for intelligent cooperation of UAV swarm. However, these methods are resource-in-tensive that cannot be directly applied in the computation and storage constrained UAVs. In this article, we propose a novel digital twin (DT)-based intelligent cooperation framework of UAV swarm. In the framework, a digital twin model is established to reflect the physical entity (i.e., UAV swarm) with high-fidelity and monitors its whole life cycle. Next, the decision model that integrates a machine learning algorithm is built to explore the global optimal solution and controls the behaviors of UAV swarm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, a case study on intelligent network reconstruction is introduced, and simulation results are presented. Finally, a representative application provided by the framework is discussed.},

  year={2021},
  volume={8},
  number={2},
  pages={334-343},
  abstract={This paper presents an innovative investigation on prototyping a digital twin (DT) as the platform for human-robot interactive welding and welder behavior analysis. This human-robot interaction (HRI) working style helps to enhance human users' operational productivity and comfort; while data-driven welder behavior analysis benefits to further novice welder training. This HRI system includes three modules: 1) a human user who demonstrates the welding operations offsite with her/his operations recorded by the motion-tracked handles; 2) a robot that executes the demonstrated welding operations to complete the physical welding tasks onsite; 3) a DT system that is developed based on virtual reality (VR) as a digital replica of the physical human-robot interactive welding environment. The DT system bridges a human user and robot through a bi-directional information flow: a) transmitting demonstrated welding operations in VR to the robot in the physical environment; b) displaying the physical welding scenes to human users in VR. Compared to existing DT systems reported in the literatures, the developed one provides better capability in engaging human users in interacting with welding scenes, through an augmented VR. To verify the effectiveness, six welders, skilled with certain manual welding training and unskilled without any training, tested the system by completing the same welding job; three skilled welders produce satisfied welded workpieces, while the other three unskilled do not. A data-driven approach as a combination of fast Fourier transform (FFT), principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector machine (SVM) is developed to analyze their behaviors. Given an operation sequence, i.e., motion speed sequence of the welding torch, frequency features are firstly extracted by FFT and then reduced in dimension through PCA, which are finally routed into SVM for classification. The trained model demonstrates a 94.44% classification accuracy in the testing dataset. The successful pattern recognition in skilled welder operations should benefit to accelerate novice welder training.},

  volume={14},
  number={},
  pages={1267-1282},
  abstract={The deployment of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship real-time detection is largely hindered by huge computational cost. In this article, we propose a novel learning scheme for training a lightweight ship detector called Tiny YOLO-Lite, which simultaneously 1) reduces the model storage size; 2) decreases the floating point operations (FLOPs) calculation; and 3) guarantees the high accuracy with faster speed. This is achieved by self-designed backbone structure and network pruning, which enforces channel-level sparsity in the backbone network and yields a compact model. In addition, knowledge distillation is also applied to make up for the performance decline caused by network pruning. Hereinto, we propose to let small student model mimic cumbersome teacher's output to achieve improved generalization. Rather than applying vanilla full feature imitation, we redefine the distilled knowledge as the inter-relationship between different levels of feature maps and then transfer it from the large network to a smaller one. On account that the detectors should focus more on the salient regions containing ships while background interference is overwhelming, a novel attention mechanism is designed and then attached to the distilled feature for enhanced representation. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on SSDD, HRSID, and two large-scene SAR images to verify the effectiveness of the thinner SAR ship object detector in comparison of with other CNN-based algorithms. The detection results demonstrate that the proposed detector can achieve lighter architecture with 2.8-M model size, more efficient inference (>200 fps) with low computation cost, and more accurate prediction with knowledge transfer strategy.},

  abstract={An aircraft is made up of a number of complicated systems which work in harmony to ensure safe and trouble-free flight. In order to maintain such a platform, many diagnostic and prognostic techniques have been suggested, mostly aimed at components but some at the system level. Together these form a patchwork approach to the overall problem of efficiently informing aircraft maintenance to the Original Equipment Manufacturers, the operators /airlines, and the Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul organisations. It involves these organisations having to support several different approaches to aircraft health management, and is therefore inefficient and costly. In the current work, a streamlined methodology is put forward. This is based on OSA-CBM (Open System Architecture for Condition Based Maintenance) and can be applied to any aircraft system. Integral with this is the use of mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) for feature selection, the resulting symptom vector being used for fault diagnosis. This approach is demonstrated on three test cases: the engine, the environmental control system, and the fuel system. In each case, the digital twin setup, simulation conditions for healthy and faulty scenarios, a methodology based on OSA-CBM up to diagnostics are detailed. Diagnostics is carried out for each system in turn, using four machine learning supervised algorithms. The best performing algorithm for each system will then subsequently be used in a vehicle level reasoner called FAVER (A Framework for Aerospace Vehicle Reasoning), which requires these system diagnoses as a starting point for vehicle reasoning and fault ambiguity resolution.},

  abstract={Since the emergence of digital and smart healthcare, the world has hastened to apply various technologies in this field to promote better health operation and patients’ well being, increase life expectancy, and reduce healthcare costs. One promising technology and game changer in this domain is digital twin (DT). DT is expected to change the concept of digital healthcare and take this field to another level that has never been seen before. DT is a virtual replica of a physical asset that reflects the current status through real-time transformed data. This article proposes and implements an intelligent context-aware healthcare system using the DT framework. This framework is a beneficial contribution to digital healthcare and to improve healthcare operations. Accordingly, an electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rhythms classifier model was built using machine learning to diagnose heart disease and detect heart problems. The implemented models successfully predicted a particular heart condition with high accuracy in different algorithms. The collected results have shown that integrating DT with the healthcare field would improve healthcare processes by bringing patients and healthcare professionals together in an intelligent, comprehensive, and scalable health ecosystem. Also, implementing an ECG classifier that detects heart conditions gives the inspiration for applying ML and artificial intelligence with different human body metrics for continuous monitoring and abnormalities detection. Finally, neural-network-based algorithms deal better with ECG data than traditional ML algorithms.},

  pages={1225-1235},
  abstract={This article proposes a human-knowledge-integrated particle swarm optimization (Hi-PSO) scheme to globally optimize the design of the hydraulic-electromagnetic energy-harvesting shock absorber (HESA) for road vehicles. A newly developed k-fold swarm learning framework is the key to the Hi-PSO scheme, which runs k groups (folds) of individual local optimization (using a selected learning cycle), and validation (using the other k-1 testing cycles) with the concept of digital twin introduced into the design of the HESA. It aims to achieve the optimum energy recovery efficiency globally in both learning cycles and testing cycles. Within the learning framework, a nearest-neighborhood particle swarm learning algorithm is developed to incorporate human knowledge (e.g., ISO standards) for local optimization so that the computational load can be reduced through downsizing of the learning spaces. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the energy recovery and damping performance under both local conditions (duty cycles used for learning) and global conditions (six duty cycles covering the main equivalent amplitudes and frequencies of the suspension's operation). Compared with the conventional PSO algorithm, Hi-PSO is shown to be more robust by achieving a 5.17% higher mean value in 10 trials while achieving the same maximum energy efficiency. The global optimum result is obtained under 20 mm/1.5 Hz condition and achieves an average energy efficiency of 59.07%.},

  abstract={As of today, the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication system has been rolled out in many countries and the number of 5G subscribers already reaches a very large scale. It is time for academia and industry to shift their attention towards the next generation. At this crossroad, an overview of the current state of the art and a vision of future communications are definitely of interest. This article thus aims to provide a comprehensive survey to draw a picture of the sixth generation (6G) system in terms of drivers, use cases, usage scenarios, requirements, key performance indicators (KPIs), architecture, and enabling technologies. First, we attempt to answer the question of “Is there any need for 6G?” by shedding light on its key driving factors, in which we predict the explosive growth of mobile traffic until 2030, and envision potential use cases and usage scenarios. Second, the technical requirements of 6G are discussed and compared with those of 5G with respect to a set of KPIs in a quantitative manner. Third, the state-of-the-art 6G research efforts and activities from representative institutions and countries are summarized, and a tentative roadmap of definition, specification, standardization, and regulation is projected. Then, we identify a dozen of potential technologies and introduce their principles, advantages, challenges, and open research issues. Finally, the conclusions are drawn to paint a picture of “What 6G may look like?.” This survey is intended to serve as an enlightening guideline to spur interests and further investigations for subsequent research and development of 6G communications systems.},

  abstract={The 6G vision of creating authentic digital twin representations of the physical world calls for new sensing solutions to compose multi-layered maps of our environments. Radio sensing using the mobile communication network as a sensor has the potential to become an essential component of the solution. With the evolution of cellular systems to mmWave bands in 5G and potentially sub-THz bands in 6G, small cell deployments will begin to dominate. Large bandwidth systems deployed in small cell configurations provide an unprecedented opportunity to employ the mobile network for sensing. In this paper, we focus on the major design aspects of such a cellular joint communication and sensing (JCAS) system. We present an analysis of the choice of the waveform that points towards choosing the one that is best suited for communication also for radar sensing. We discuss several techniques for efficiently integrating the sensing capability into the JCAS system, some of which are applicable with NR air-interface for evolved 5G systems. Specifically, methods for reducing sensing overhead by appropriate sensing signal design or by configuring separate numerologies for communications and sensing are presented. Sophisticated use of the sensing signals is shown to reduce the signaling overhead by a factor of 2.67 for an exemplary road traffic monitoring use case. We then present a vision for future advanced JCAS systems building upon distributed massive MIMO and discuss various other research challenges for JCAS that need to be addressed in order to pave the way towards natively integrated JCAS in 6G.},

  abstract={Optical communication is developing rapidly in the directions of hardware resource diversification, transmission system flexibility, and network function virtualization. Its proliferation poses a significant challenge to traditional optical communication management and control systems. Digital twin (DT), a technology that utilizes data, models, and algorithms and integrates multiple disciplines, acts as a bridge between the real and virtual worlds for comprehensive connectivity. In the digital space, virtual models are established dynamically to simulate and describe the states, behaviors, and rules of physical objects in the physical space. DT has been significantly developed and widely applied in the industrial and military fields. This study introduces the DT technology to optical communication through interdisciplinary crossing and proposes a DT framework suitable for optical communication.

We performed a systematic review on top of multidisciplinary electronic bibliographic databases, in addition to existing patents in the field.

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={35691-35708},
  abstract={There are many pressures on the global food system such as urbanization, climate change, and environmental degradation. Urban agriculture is an approach to producing food inside cities where, globally, more than half the worlds population live. It has been shown to have a range of potential benefits, for instance in reducing waste and logistics costs. Increased uptake of urban farming can even relieve pressure on the natural environment by reducing the burden of production required from farmland by creating space for it to recover from accumulated damage as a result of the use of unsustainable farming practices historically. This article describes an approach for a new type of decision support system suitable for urban farming production. We discuss differences between the requirements and the users of decision support in urban agriculture, and those of ordinary agribusiness enterprises. A case study is performed using a novel technology for urban farming: a cyber-physical implementation of aquaponics is enhanced with adaptive capabilities using a digital twin system and machine learning. Aquaponics is a farming technique that utilizes a harmonious nutrient exchange cycle for growing plants and fish together, while conserving water, and possibly without the need for soil or even sunlight. Empirical results are provided that evaluate the use of data driven decision analytics and a digital twin model to plan production from the aquaponic system during a three month trial. Another set of results evaluate a proposed modelling framework for large scale urban agriculture ecosystems. This concept forms the basis of the suggested approach for an urban farming decision support system that coordinates the activities of many independent producers to target collective goals.},

  pages={3061-3072},
  abstract={Objective: This study aims to develop and validate a novel framework, iPhantom, for automated creation of patient-specific phantoms or “digital-twins (DT)” using patient medical images. The framework is applied to assess radiation dose to radiosensitive organs in CT imaging of individual patients. Method: Given a volume of patient CT images, iPhantom segments selected anchor organs and structures (e.g., liver, bones, pancreas) using a learning-based model developed for multi-organ CT segmentation. Organs which are challenging to segment (e.g., intestines) are incorporated from a matched phantom template, using a diffeomorphic registration model developed for multi-organ phantom-voxels. The resulting digital-twin phantoms are used to assess organ doses during routine CT exams. Result: iPhantom was validated on both with a set of XCAT digital phantoms (n = 50) and an independent clinical dataset (n = 10) with similar accuracy. iPhantom precisely predicted all organ locations yielding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) 0.6 - 1 for anchor organs and DSC of 0.3-0.9 for all other organs. iPhantom showed <; 10% errors in estimated radiation dose for the majority of organs, which was notably superior to the state-of-the-art baseline method (20-35% dose errors). Conclusion: iPhantom enables automated and accurate creation of patient-specific phantoms and, for the first time, provides sufficient and automated patient-specific dose estimates for CT dosimetry. Significance: The new framework brings the creation and application of CHPs (computational human phantoms) to the level of individual CHPs through automation, achieving wide and precise organ localization, paving the way for clinical monitoring, personalized optimization, and large-scale research.},

  pages={45454-45461},
  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD) is one of the most effective neural network light-weighting techniques when training data is available. However, KD is seldom applicable to an environment where it is difficult or impossible to access training data. To solve this problem, a complete zero-shot KD (C-ZSKD) based on adversarial learning has been recently proposed, but the so-called biased sample generation problem limits the performance of C-ZSKD. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel C-ZSKD algorithm that utilizes a label-free adversarial perturbation. The proposed adversarial perturbation derives a constraint of the squared norm of gradient style by using the convolution of probability distributions and the 2nd order Taylor series approximation. The constraint serves to increase the variance of the adversarial sample distribution, which makes the student model learn the decision boundary of the teacher model more accurately without labeled data. Through analysis of the distribution of adversarial samples on the embedded space, this paper also provides an insight into the characteristics of adversarial samples that are effective for adversarial learning-based C-ZSKD.},

  year={2021},
  volume={30},
  number={},
  pages={3734-3747},
  abstract={Despite the fact that great progress has been made on single image deraining tasks, it is still challenging for existing models to produce satisfactory results directly, and it often requires a single or multiple refinement stages to gradually improve the quality. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that existing image-level refinement with a stage-independent learning design is problematic with the side effect of over/under-deraining. To resolve this issue, we for the first time propose the mechanism of learning to carry out refinement on the unsatisfactory features, and propose a novel attentive feature refinement (AFR) module. Specifically, AFR is designed as a two-branched network for simultaneous rain-distribution-aware attention map learning and attention guided hierarchy-preserving feature refinement. Guided by task-specific attention, coarse features are progressively refined to better model the diversified rainy effects. By using a separable convolution as the basic component, our AFR module introduces little computation overhead and can be readily integrated into most rainy-to-clean image translation networks for achieving better deraining results. By incorporating a series of AFR modules into a general encoder-decoder network, AFR-Net is constructed for deraining and it achieves new state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real images. Furthermore, by using AFR-Net as a teacher model, we explore the use of knowledge distillation to successfully learn a student model that is also able to achieve state-of-the-art results but with a much faster inference speed (i.e., it only takes 0.08 second to process a 512×512 rainy image). Code and pre-trained models are available at (https://github.com/RobinCSIRO/AFR-Net).},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT) systems that replicate the physical world digitally are powerful tools for monitoring physical systems and evaluating algorithms, but current DT systems are commonly not applicable for robotic deployment and investigation. Meanwhile, current 3-D simulation-based robotic platforms do not model the dynamics of the physical world on-the-fly as done in DT systems, limiting their potential for the development of robotics in challenging environments. To tackle this issue, we propose the first robot-centered smart DT framework, namely, Terra, to facilitate the deployment of robots in challenging environments. The proposed Terra framework introduces a comprehensive DT representation to encode the useful real-time dynamics of both the physical world and the robot agent deployed therein. A multiview multimodality perception module is further devised for Terra to obtain high-level semantics and deliver a precise description of the current status of the environment and the robot agent. By mapping the perceived results to the virtual replica of the physical environment, Terra actively updates the action policy and sends it back to the agent, forming an integral and real-time information feedback loop. In practice, to help demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework, we deliberately set up a challenging unordered physical environment with many obstacles and a very simple robot aiming to fulfill a navigation task. Empirical results show that the proposed Terra framework successfully facilitates the robot to accomplish the task without causing hazards.},

  abstract={This study proposes a novel hands-free interaction method using multimodal gestures such as eye gazing and head gestures and deep learning for human-robot interaction (HRI) in mixed reality (MR) environments. Since human operators hold some objects for conducting tasks, there are many constrained situations where they cannot use their hands for HRI interactions. To provide more effective and intuitive task assistance, the proposed hands-free method supports coarse-to-fine interactions. Eye gazing-based interaction is used for coarse interactions such as searching and previewing of target objects, and head gesture interactions are used for fine interactions such as selection and 3D manipulation. In addition, deep learning-based object detection is applied to estimate the initial positioning of physical objects to be manipulated by the robot. The result of object detection is then combined with 3D spatial mapping in the MR environment for supporting accurate initial object positioning. Furthermore, virtual object-based indirect manipulation is proposed to support more intuitive and efficient control of the robot, compared with traditional direct manipulation (e.g., joint-based and end effector-based manipulations). In particular, a digital twin, the synchronized virtual robot of the real robot, is used to provide a preview and simulation of the real robot to manipulate it more effectively and accurately. Two case studies were conducted to confirm the originality and advantages of the proposed hands-free HRI: (1) performance evaluation of initial object positioning and (2) comparative analysis with traditional direct robot manipulations. The deep learning-based initial positioning reduces much effort for robot manipulation using eye gazing and head gestures. The object-based indirect manipulation also supports more effective HRI than previous direct interaction methods.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been a great deal of research in developing end-to-end speech recognition models, which enable simplifying the traditional pipeline and achieving promising results. Despite their remarkable performance improvements, end-to-end models typically require expensive computational cost to show successful performance. To reduce this computational burden, knowledge distillation (KD), which is a popular model compression method, has been used to transfer knowledge from a deep and complex model (teacher) to a shallower and simpler model (student). Previous KD approaches have commonly designed the architecture of the student by reducing the width per layer or the number of layers of the teacher. This structural reduction scheme might limit the flexibility of model selection since the student model structure should be similar to that of the given teacher. To cope with this limitation, we propose a KD method for end-to-end speech recognition, namely TutorNet, that applies KD techniques across different types of neural networks at the hidden representation-level as well as the output-level. For concrete realizations, we firstly apply representation-level knowledge distillation (RKD) during the initialization step, and then apply the softmax-level knowledge distillation (SKD) combined with the original task learning. When the student is trained with RKD, we make use of frame weighting that points out the frames to which the teacher pays more attention. Through a number of experiments, it is verified that TutorNet not only distills the knowledge between networks with different topologies but also significantly contributes to improving the performance of the distilled student.},

  pages={1542-1555},
  abstract={Voice activity detection is an essential pre-processing component for speech-related tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional supervised VAD systems obtain frame-level labels from an ASR pipeline by using, e.g., a Hidden Markov model. These ASR models are commonly trained on clean and fully transcribed data, limiting VAD systems to be trained on clean or synthetically noised datasets. Therefore, a major challenge for supervised VAD systems is their generalization towards noisy, real-world data. This work proposes a data-driven teacher-student approach for VAD, which utilizes vast and unconstrained audio data for training. Unlike previous approaches, only weak labels during teacher training are required, enabling the utilization of any real-world, potentially noisy dataset. Our approach firstly trains a teacher model on a source dataset (Audioset) using clip-level supervision. After training, the teacher provides frame-level guidance to a student model on an unlabeled, target dataset. A multitude of student models trained on mid- to large-sized datasets are investigated (Audioset, Voxceleb, NIST SRE). Our approach is then respectively evaluated on clean, artificially noised, and real-world data. We observe significant performance gains in artificially noised and real-world scenarios. Lastly, we compare our approach against other unsupervised and supervised VAD methods, demonstrating our method's superiority.},

  abstract={As COVID-19 hounds the world, the common cause of finding a swift solution to manage the pandemic has brought together researchers, institutions, governments, and society at large. The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI)—including machine learning (ML) and Big Data analytics—as well as Robotics and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First, four areas, where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely: 1) tracking and tracing; 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable IoT (WIoT); 3) personal digital twins (PDTs); and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in South Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis; 2) risk prediction; 3) vaccine and drug development; 4) research data set; 5) early warnings and alerts; 6) social control and fake news detection; and 7) communication and chatbot. Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including: 1) crowd surveillance; 2) public announcements; 3) screening and diagnosis; and 4) essential supply delivery. Finally, we discuss how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19.},

  abstract={The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has caused a crisis that affects all segments of the population. As the knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 evolve, an appropriate response plan for this pandemic is considered one of the most effective methods for controlling the spread of the virus. Recent studies indicate that a city Digital Twin (DT) is beneficial for tackling this health crisis, because it can construct a virtual replica to simulate factors, such as climate conditions, response policies, and people's trajectories, to help plan efficient and inclusive decisions. However, a city DTsystem relies on long-term and high-quality data collection to make appropriate decisions, limiting its advantages when facing urgent crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Federated Learning (FL), in which all clients can learn a shared model while retaining all training data locally, emerges as a promising solution for accumulating the insights from multiple data sources efficiently Furthermore, the enhanced privacy protection settings removing the privacy barriers lie in this collaboration. In this work, we propose a framework that fused city DT with FL to achieve a novel collaborative paradigm that allows multiple city DTs to share the local strategy and status quickly. In particular, an FL central server manages the local updates of multiple collaborators (city DTs), providing a global model that is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems until the model gains the correlations between various response plans and infection trends. This approach means a collaborative city DT paradigm fused with FL techniques can obtain knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs and eventually establish a "global view" of city crisis management. Meanwhile, it also helps improve each city's DT by consolidating other DT's data without violating privacy rules. In this paper, we use the COVID-19 pandemic as the use case of the proposed framework. The experimental results on a real dataset with various response plans validate our proposed solution and demonstrate its superior performance.},

  abstract={This article presents an approach based on numerical reduced-order modeling to analyze the thermal behavior of electric traction motors. In this article, a single conjugate heat transfer analysis provides the possibility to accurately predict thermal performances by incorporating both computational fluid dynamic and heat transfer modules. Then, the developed model is used as the basis for deriving a fast reduced-order model of the traction motor enabling prediction of motor thermal behavior in duty cycles with a high number of operating points. All the results achieved are verified using flow and temperature measurements carried out on a traction motor designed and built for a traction application. A good agreement between the measured and estimated values of flows and temperatures is achieved while keeping the computation time within a reasonable range for both the full-order and reduced-order conjugate heat transfer models. The optimized full-order model can be run in minutes and the reduced-order model computation time is less than one second per operating point. The transient simulation based on the reduced-order model is conducted and both the learning phase and validation results are well illustrated. It is shown than the deviation of the reduced-order model in estimating the motor thermal performance is less than one celsius degree from the full-order model.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation, which aims to train model under the supervision from another large model (teacher model) to the original model (student model), has achieved remarkable results in supervised learning. However, there are two major problems with existing knowledge distillation methods. One is the teacher's supervision is sometimes misleading, and the other is the student's prediction is not accurate enough. To address the first issue, instead of learning a combination of both teachers and ground truth, we apply knowledge adjustment to correct teachers' supervision using ground truth. For the second problem, we use the selective classification framework to train the student model. In particular, the deep gambler loss is adopted to predict with reservation by explicitly introducing the ($m+1$)-th class. We consider two settings of knowledge distillation: (1) distillation across different network structures (AlexNet, ResNet), and (2) distillation across networks with different depths (ResNet18, ResNet5 0) to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results on benchmark datasets (i.e., Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100) are reported with higher prediction accuracies and lower coverage errors.},

  abstract={The importance of developing an application based on intervention technology that leads to a healthier life is widely recognized. A challenging part of realizing the application is the need for planning, i.e., considering a user's health goal (e.g., sleep at 10:00 p.m. to get enough sleep), providing intervention at the appropriate timing to help the user achieve the goal. The reinforcement learning (RL) approach is well suited to this type of problem since it is a methodology for planning; RL finds the optimal strategy as that which maximizes future expected profit. The purpose of this study is to clarify the effects of intervention based on RL to support healthy daily life. Therefore, we (i) collect real daily activity data from participants, (ii) generate a user model that imitates the user's response to system interventions, (iii) examine valuable goals and design them as rewards in RL and (iv) obtain optimal intervention strategies by RL via simulations given a user model and goals. We evaluate a generated user model and verify by simulations whether our method could successfully achieve the goal. In addition, we analyze the cases that demonstrated higher probability of achieving the goal and report the features.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},

  pages={6243-6250},
  abstract={The Mean Teacher (MT) model of Tarvainen and Valpola has shown good performance on several semi-supervised benchmark datasets. MT maintains a teacher model's weights as the exponential moving average of a student model's weights and minimizes the divergence between their probability predictions under diverse perturbations of the inputs. However, MT is known to suffer from confirmation bias, that is, reinforcing incorrect teacher model predictions. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method called Local Clustering (LC) to mitigate the effect of confirmation bias. In MT, each data point is considered independent of other points during training; however, data points are likely to be close to each other in feature space if they share similar features. Motivated by this, we cluster data points locally by minimizing the pairwise distance between neighboring data points in feature space. Combined with a standard classification cross-entropy objective on labeled data points, the misclassified unlabeled data points are pulled towards high-density regions of their correct class with the help of their neighbors, thus improving model performance. We demonstrate on semi-supervised benchmark datasets SVHN and CIFAR-10 that adding our LC loss to MT yields significant improvements compared to MT and performance comparable to the state of the art in semi-supervised learning11The code is available at: https://github.com/jay1204/local_clustering_with_mt_for_ssl.},

  abstract={There is a high demand for high-end lab equipment in engineering education, especially for courses that require practical hands-on lab exercises. However, this equipment is quite expensive which forces some institutions to seek other alternatives or forego them altogether. In addition, online courses tend to be light on hardware because of the practical and technical challenges associated with running remote hardware-based laboratories. Therefore, a system is needed that allows students who are enrolled in remote courses to experience hardware-intensive classes just as they would an in-person course (especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic). In this work, use virtual and augmented reality to build and test a remote UR-10 robotics lab that allows students to work together on a hands-on robotics-based lab. In the future, we plan to demonstrate its technical and pedagogical suitability by running a user study in a real-world class whereby remote students enrolled in a course will participate in a series of experiments to control a UR-10 robot arm. It opens up avenues to explore the advantages and shortcomings of running coordinated group lab exercises between students from different institutions, time-zones, and continents by time-decoupling the schedules. The use of a Virtual Reality interface coupled with a digital twin of the UR10 robot will allow us to investigate the suitability of different user interfaces, and what VR tools would best facilitate remote group work and faculty instruction.},

  abstract={Most of the methods in operators' current 5G networks use expert knowledge assisted by machine learning algorithms to generate optimization decisions. However, these methods are inadaptive to the dynamic changes of high-dimensional network states, thus the result is often suboptimal. Reinforcement learning can better cope with high-dimensional network state space and parameter space. However, when applied to real network, challenges arise such as difficult to obtain data samples, time-consuming and risky to explore real networks during model training. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a combined approach of expert knowledge, reinforcement learning and digital twin for the self-optimization of mobile networks. By constructing a digital twin of the current network, the future network state is predicted based on which optimization decisions are generated by expert knowledge and reinforcement learning respectively, and then input into the digital twin. Digital twin simulates their rewards and decides a final action for execution. Simulation results have confirmed that the proposed scheme can achieve higher rewards than either expert knowledge or reinforcement learning, and can avoid negative impact on real network performance. This paper also describes several potential application scenarios for the proposed approach in 6G networks and discusses key issues for future research.},

Specifically, teacher-assisted mini-batch (TAM) sampling is proposed, which makes triplets of anchor, positive and negative samples on unlabeled data by using the teacher's knowledge. In addition, we propose a metric-based loss, namely Contrastive Additive Margin (CAM) Softmax loss, which efficiently uses all combinations of triplets on each mini-batch obtained by TAM sampling. In experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed framework on face and speaker verification tasks, where student models are trained on unlabeled VoxCeleb videos with a teacher model pre-trained on VGGFace2 images.},

  abstract={Segmentation of skin lesions is important for disease diagnoses and treatment planning. Over the years, semi-supervised methods using pseudo labels have boosted the segmentation performance with limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However, the unreliable targets in pseudo labels might lead to meaningless guidance for unlabeled data. In this paper, to solve this issue, we propose a novel confidence aware semi-supervised learning method based on a mean teacher scheme. Concretely, we design a confidence module to predict the model confidence guided by the True Class Probability. Then in the mean teacher framework, the student model gradually learns trustworthy targets from teacher model. To further improve the segmentation quality, we fine-tune the student model with reliable content in pseudo labels. We conduct extensive experiments on 2018 ISIC skin lesion segmentation dataset and our method outperforms other state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches.},

Secondly, the proposed method overcomes the difficulty of distribution shift between well-labeled and unlabeled data by jointing three losses. Especially, the proposed method constructs an effective latent space with the joint loss considering the inter-class and the intra-class correlations for image sentiments. From experimental results, the performance improvement with CDSS-DML is confirmed.},

  abstract={This paper presents an improved mean teacher (MT) based method for large-scale weakly labeled semi-supervised sound event detection (SED), by focusing on learning a better student model. Two main improvements are proposed based on the authors’ previous perturbation based MT method. Firstly, an event-aware module is de-signed to allow multiple branches with different kernel sizes to be fused via an attention mechanism. By inserting this module after the convolutional layer, each neuron can adaptively adjust its receptive field to suit different sound events. Secondly, instead of using the teacher model to provide a consistency cost term, we propose using a stochastic inference of unlabeled examples to generate high quality pseudo-targets by averaging multiple predictions from the perturbed student model. MixUp of both labeled and unlabeled data is further exploited to improve the effectiveness of student model. Finally, the teacher model can be obtained via exponential moving average (EMA) of the student model, which generates final predictions for SED during inference. Experiments on the DCASE2018 task4 dataset demonstrate the ability of the proposed method. Specifically, an F1-score of 42.1% is achieved, significantly outperforming the 32.4% achieved by the winning system, or the 39.3% by the previous perturbation based method.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation refers to a technique of transferring the knowledge from a large learned model or an ensemble of learned models to a small model. This method relies on access to the original training set, which might not always be available. A possible solution is a data-free adversarial distillation framework, which deploys a generative network to transfer the teacher model’s knowledge to the student model. However, the data generation efficiency is low in the data-free adversarial distillation. We add an activation regularizer and a virtual interpolation method to improve the data generation efficiency. The activation regularizer enables the students to match the teacher’s predictions close to activation boundaries and decision boundaries. The virtual interpolation method can generate virtual samples and labels in-between decision boundaries. Our experiments show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art data-free distillation methods. The student model can achieve 95.42% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 77.05% accuracy on CIFAR-100 without any original training data. Our model’s accuracy is 13.8% higher than the state-of-the-art data-free method on CIFAR-100.},
