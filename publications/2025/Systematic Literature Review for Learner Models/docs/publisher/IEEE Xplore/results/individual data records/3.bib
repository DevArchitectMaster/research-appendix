  abstract={Over the past few years, deep learning (DL) based electricity demand forecasting has received considerable attention amongst mathematicians, engineers and data scientists working within the smart grid domain. To this end, deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks (DNN), deep belief networks (DBN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been successfully applied to forecast the generation and consumption of a wide range of energy vectors. In this work, we show preliminary results for a residential load demand forecasting solution which is realized within the framework of power grid digital twin. To this end, a novel class of deep neural networks is adopted wherein the output of the network is efficiently computed via a black-box ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. We introduce the readers to the main concepts behind this method followed by a real-world, data driven computational benchmark test case designed to study the numerical effectiveness of the proposed approach. Initial results suggest that the ODE based solutions yield acceptable levels of accuracy for wide range of prediction horizons. We conclude that the method could prove as a valuable tool to develop forecasting models within an electrical digital twin (EDT) framework, where, in addition to accurate prediction models, a time horizon independent, computationally scalable and compact model is often desired.},

  abstract={The variable frequency drive (VFD) motor controller has been proven to be suitable for shipboard low voltage and medium voltage application. The variable speed electric propulsion is very popular due to the full range of speed and torque controls. The medium voltage variable speed electric propulsion can achieve high propeller power a with full range of speed controls. There are types of power switching devices used with VFDs. This chapter discusses the use of IGBT which are semiconductor switches that are turned on and off, creating a pulse width modulated output with regulated frequency. The smart ship system design concept can be embodied in &#x201c;digital twin&#x201d; in view of low cost computing, powerful analytical platforms of data mining, machine learning, and data networking technology. Any complex ship design and development fidelity can be achieved by using &#x201c;digital twin&#x201d;, so that there is no need for arbitrary simulation, costly hardware in the loop prototyping.},

  abstract={The ship smart system design (S3D) is introduced for the ship system design engineers to address the design challenges of VFD motor controller. The S3D concept is also recommended for existing a VFD and ASD&#x2010;populated motor controller based electrical system to establish exact nature of VFD generated electric noise to compare with the calculated noise and then establish a baseline if it is within the regulatory requirements. If the electrical noise (harmonics) level is more than the acceptable level, then undertake Harmonic Management System to bring the harmonics to an acceptable. The S3D concept evolving over the past two decades has been enabled by the advancement of low&#x2010;cost computing, powerful software, and analytical platforms for data mining, machine learning, and data networking technology.

  abstract={This paper proposes Bayesian Regularization (BR) along with artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) based machine learning to model power converters and analyze their performance. Unlike techniques such as PWM switch, state-space averaging, etc., this approach uses data from simulations or hardware experiments to develop the system model. The different steps involved in this modeling process are: (i) using an existing simulation or hardware prototype of the converter, collect data of different system parameters such as time, inductance, capacitance, resistance, voltages, currents, etc., (ii) categorize these parameters into inputs and outputs of the model, (iii) use BR-ANN to model transient performance and RF with bootstrap aggregation to model steady state response, (iv) validate the models with training and testing data sets, and (v) use the model to test with new values of input parameters. The proposed methodologies are tested using conventional buck and boost converters for proof of concept. It is envisioned that this technique can be used to create digital twins of power converters in practical circuits, optimize performance and predict fault conditions.},

  pages={1484-1491},
  abstract={Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) aims to support Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) by monitoring, diagnosing, and prognosing the health of the host system. One of the technologies required by IVHM to carry out its objectives is the means to emulate the functioning of the host system, and the concept of a Digital Twin (DT) was introduced in aerospace IVHM to represent the functioning of such a complex system. This paper aims to discuss the role played by DT in the field of IVHM. A DT is the virtual representation of any physical product, that is used to project the functioning of the product at a given instance. The DT is used across the lifecycle of any product, and its output can be customized depending upon the area of application. The DT is currently popular in industry because of the technologies like sensors, cloud computing, Internet of Things, machine learning, and advanced software, which enabled its development. This paper discusses what encompasses a DT, the technologies that support the DT, its applications across industries, and its development in academia. This paper also talks about how a DT can combine with IVHM technology to assess the health of complex systems like an aircraft. Lastly, this paper presents various challenges faced by industry during the implementation of a DT and some of the possible opportunities for future growth.},

  abstract={Low-resolution face recognition in the wild still is an open problem. In this paper, we propose to address this problem via a novel learning approach called Mixed-Domain Distillation (MDD). The approach applies a teacher-student framework to mix and distill knowledge from four different domain datasets, including private high-resolution, public high-resolution, public low-resolution web and target low-resolution wild face datasets. In this way, high-resolution knowledge from the well-trained complex teacher model is first adapted to public high-resolution faces and then transferred to a simply student model. The student model is designed to identify low-resolution faces, and could perform face recognition in the wild effectively and efficiently. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms several existing models for low-resolution face recognition in the wild.},

  pages={185991-186003},
  abstract={This paper develops an incremental randomized learning method for an extended Echo State Network (φ-ESN), which has a reservoir with random static projection, to better cope with non-linear time series data modelling problems. Although the typical ESN can effectively improve the prediction performance of the network by extending a random static nonlinear hidden layer, since the input weights and biases of the hidden neurons in the extended static layer are randomly assigned, some neurons have little effect on reducing the model error, resulting in high model complexity, poor generalization and large performance fluctuation. A constructive incremental randomized learning method termed OLS-φ-ESN is proposed for generating the nodes of the extended static nonlinear hidden layer. Two-step training paradigm is adopted, namely, randomly assigning the input weights and biases of the hidden neurons in the extended static layer according to a supervisory mechanism and solving output weights by least squares algorithm. Based on Orthogonal Least Squares (OLS) search algorithm, the proposed supervisory mechanism is designed where an adaptive threshold is also set to better control the compactness of the generated learner model. Simulation results concerning both nonlinear time series prediction and system identification tasks indicate some advantages of our proposed OLS-φ-ESN in terms of more compact model and sound generalization.},

  abstract={Learning without constraints of space and time has nowadays become a reality thanks to the exponential growth of the Internet, and distance learning is one of the areas for which that growth has been the most beneficial. The Web offers several platforms for distance learning, calibrated for the public or private sector. Among these, the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are one of the most popular online learning assets. In MOOCs, a crucial feature is given by the amount of enrolled learners: thousands can attend such courses. Consequently, monitoring the learning process of individual students is a challenging task for teachers in MOOCs. Peer Assessment can be used, in these case, as a teaching strategy, to follow the dynamics of a MOOC while not checking directly on each one of the individual students. In previous work we have presented a method to support peer assessment, and grades inference, mediated by a limited grading work performed by the teacher. The method is based on a definition of student model based on a modified version of the machine learning technique called K-NN. In this paper we present a system able to simulate the dynamics of a MOOC class where peer assessment, mediated by the teacher, takes place. The system supports the creation of a (big) class, and the simulation of peer assessment sessions, where peer grading, and teacher grading take place. The system, then, allows for a statistical analysis of how the student models computed by the system, and the grades inferred for the peers' tasks, converge towards the real values for the student models and grades.},

  abstract={Intelligent tutoring systems are becoming an important mean of education delivery and have changed the ways of teaching and learning. One of their most important aspects concerns the personalization and the adaptation of the learning procedures to learners' characteristics. This is mainly achieved with the use of student modelling which is employed to record user context and to enhance the learning experience of the students. In this work, we present a generic ontology that incorporates concepts and properties used to model user profiles in order to formulate concrete, complete and extensible user modelling in e-learning systems. The ontology consists of learners' personal, cognitive and social information as well as information about their performance and skills. In order to keep the student model updated, semantic rules are utilized to analyse student learning and to extract knowledge regarding their performance. The ontological approach is domain independent and can be utilized as a reference model for learner representation in intelligent tutoring systems in higher and distance education.},

  abstract={Person re-identification (Re-ID), for matching pedestrians across non-overlapping camera views, has made great progress in supervised learning with abundant labelled data. However, the scalability problem is the bottleneck for applications in large-scale systems. We consider the scalability problem of Re-ID from three aspects: (1) low labelling cost by reducing label amount, (2) low extension cost by reusing existing knowledge and (3) low testing computation cost by using lightweight models. The requirements render scalable Re-ID a challenging problem. To solve these problems in a unified system, we propose a Multi-teacher Adaptive Similarity Distillation Framework, which requires only a few labelled identities of target domain to transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models to a user-specified lightweight student model without accessing source domain data. We propose the Log-Euclidean Similarity Distillation Loss for Re-ID and further integrate the Adaptive Knowledge Aggregator to select effective teacher models to transfer target-adaptive knowledge. Extensive evaluations show that our method can extend with high scalability and the performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised Re-ID methods.},

  abstract={The goal of early action prediction is to recognize actions from partially observed videos with incomplete action executions, which is quite different from action recognition. Predicting early actions is very challenging since the partially observed videos do not contain enough action information for recognition. In this paper, we aim at improving early action prediction by proposing a novel teacher-student learning framework. Our framework involves a teacher model for recognizing actions from full videos, a student model for predicting early actions from partial videos, and a teacher-student learning block for distilling progressive knowledge from teacher to student, crossing different tasks. Extensive experiments on three public action datasets show that the proposed progressive teacher-student learning framework can consistently improve performance of early action prediction model. We have also reported the state-of-the-art performances for early action prediction on all of these sets.},

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate a novel deep-model reusing task. Our goal is to train a lightweight and versatile student model, without human-labelled annotations, that amalgamates the knowledge and masters the expertise of two pre-trained teacher models working on heterogeneous problems, one on scene parsing and the other on depth estimation. To this end, we propose an innovative training strategy that learns the parameters of the student intertwined with the teachers, achieved by ``projecting'' its amalgamated features onto each teacher's domain and computing the loss. We also introduce two options to generalize the proposed training strategy to handle three or more tasks simultaneously. The proposed scheme yields very encouraging results. As demonstrated on several benchmarks, the trained student model achieves results even superior to those of the teachers in their own expertise domains and on par with the state-of-the-art fully supervised models relying on human-labelled annotations.},

  pages={4928-4937},
  abstract={State-of-the-art CNN based recognition models are often computationally prohibitive to deploy on low-end devices. A promising high level approach tackling this limitation is knowledge distillation, which let small student model mimic cumbersome teacher model's output to get improved generalization. However, related methods mainly focus on simple task of classification while do not consider complex tasks like object detection. We show applying the vanilla knowledge distillation to detection model gets minor gain. To address the challenge of distilling knowledge in detection model, we propose a fine-grained feature imitation method exploiting the cross-location discrepancy of feature response. Our intuition is that detectors care more about local near object regions. Thus the discrepancy of feature response on the near object anchor locations reveals important information of how teacher model tends to generalize. We design a novel mechanism to estimate those locations and let student model imitate the teacher on them to get enhanced performance. We first validate the idea on a developed lightweight toy detector which carries simplest notion of current state-of-the-art anchor based detection models on challenging KITTI dataset, our method generates up to 15% boost of mAP for the student model compared to the non-imitated counterpart. We then extensively evaluate the method with Faster R-CNN model under various scenarios with common object detection benchmark of Pascal VOC and COCO, imitation alleviates up to 74% performance drop of student model compared to teacher.

  abstract={In heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA), since the feature spaces of the source and target domains are different, knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain is really challenging. How to align the different feature spaces and then adaptively transfer the related knowledge is critical for HDA. In this paper, we develop an adaptive teacher-and-student model for heterogeneous domain adaptation (AtsHDA). In AtsHDA, the source domain as a teacher and the target domain as a student are aligned or co-adapted to each other first, so that their correlation can be maximized. Then the target domain adaptively learns from the source domain. Specifically, there is a balance between the learning by the target domain itself and the instruction from the source domain. That is, when the guidance from the source domain is helpful for learning, the learning of target classifier emphasizes the instruction of source knowledge, and considers its own knowledge more, otherwise. Further, an ensemble method is designed to decide such a balance. Finally, empirical results show that AtsHDA can achieve competitive results compared with the state-of-arts.},

  abstract={We present a proposal for reduction of Dyslexia in children including protocol and findings; the protocol does not include a diagnostic phase for purposes of classification or searching for pathologies, we use a remedial training instead in order to configure a user model of strengths and weaknesses for a well-balanced instructional plan. The protocol phases are as follows: remedial training (as diagnostic and information collecting), configuration of a user model, planning of instructional plan based on user model, plan implementation, evaluation. The proposal is a kind of remedial training based on computer, many scientific research publications demonstrating that remedial training as a viable solution to reduction of Dyslexia. The findings are very similar to previous studies about that computer software has been a viable support of remedial training; studies refers to many points where remedial training could be useful, the first one is training in phonological structure of the words in the native language to reach a minimal level of phonological awareness; The best recommendation is training in phonological awareness before to learn to read and write; training in phonological awareness seems to have many benefits in reduction of Dyslexia and increment of reading skills [1]. The proposal reports favorable results using Testing Effect, which is a concept of cognitive psychology that enhanced long-term memory known; Testing effect had not been commonly associated as a remedial training for Dyslexia but many studies in other areas have shown promising results in basic operations like reading, writing and learning. Testing effect enhances long-term memory by doing many tests, this process of retrieving makes the information more retrievable even in long-term compared to simply studying. To implement this proposal we did use an electronic format content known as Learning Objects. Learning Object has many benefits like interoperability because it is a piece of software that can be easily read by many electronical dispositive and can contain an activity of assessment of learning as quizzes or tests. That is the particularities and philosophy of Learning Object as technology of contents. During this first phase (diagnostic), the goal of using Learning Object was testing of word recognition with test of multiple option. In this study, there is not a phonological awareness training, the testing was with one person only who is a 9 years old boy, and the training was useful and get higher results in word recognition within this context. The goal of use a remedial training supported with computer is to reduce absence from school and integrate the individual into any society activity that include reading and writing.},

  abstract={With the recent success of convolutional neural network (CNN) based text detection approaches, designing better CNN-based text detection frameworks has become a major research focus to improve text detection accuracy. In this paper, instead of following this direction, we propose to use a born-again training strategy, which is based on teacher-student learning (TSL), to improve the accuracy of the state-of-the-art CNN-based text detectors. More specifically, given a well-trained CNN-based text detector, we take it as a teacher model and train from scratch a new student model with the same topology under the supervision of both the teacher model and ground-truth labels. Furthermore, we propose a new proposal-free multi-level feature mimicking approach to making multi-level convolutional feature maps be effectively mimicked in a unified manner. Experiments demonstrate that the student models trained by the proposed approach can achieve substantially better results than their teacher models and have better generalization abilities.},

Moreover, they are systems of systems wherein understanding is available in localized contexts only and that too is typically partial and uncertain. With the overall system behaviour hard to know a-priori and conventional techniques for system-wide analysis either lacking in rigour or defeated by the scale of the problem, the current practice often exclusively relies on human expertise for monitoring and adaptation. We present an approach that combines ideas from modeling & simulation, reinforcement learning and control theory to make enterprises adaptive. The approach hinges on the concept of Digital Twin - a set of relevant models that are amenable to analysis and simulation. The paper describes illustration of approach in two real world use cases.},

  abstract={Within the public-private ECSEL Joint Undertaking, the project Productive4.0 aims for improvements with regard to digitalization for electronic components like semiconductors and systems as key enabling technologies. The semiconductor industry has a high growth potential within the frame of digitalization as manufactured products are intensively used in production and B2B environment. Thus, Supply chains employing and fabricating semiconductors become the core driver and beneficent of digitalization. In order to exploit digitalization potentials, Semantic Web technologies are used to create a digital twin for semiconductor supply chains and supply chains containing semiconductors. Exemplary benefits of this lingua franca which can be understood by humans and machines alike for various applications like simulation, deep learning, security, trust, and automation are shown in this paper.},

  abstract={Teacher-student learning can be applied in automatic speech recognition for model compression and domain adaptation. This trains a student model to emulate the behaviour of a teacher model, and only the student is used to perform recognition. Depending on the application, the teacher and student may differ in their model types, complexities, input contexts, and input features. In previous works, it is often shown that learning from a strong teacher allows the student to perform better than an equivalent model trained with only the reference transcriptions. However, there has not been much investigation into whether a particular form of teacher is appropriate for the student to learn from. This paper aims to study how effectively the student is able to learn from the teacher, when differences exist between their designs. The Augmented Multi-party Interaction (AMI) meeting transcription and Multi-Genre Broadcast (MGB-3) television broadcast audio tasks are used in this analysis. Experimental results suggest that a student can effectively learn from a more complex teacher, but may struggle when it lacks input information. It is therefore important to carefully consider the design of the student for each application.},

  abstract={Distillation-based learning boosts the performance of the miniaturized neural network based on the hypothesis that the representation of a teacher model can be used as structured and relatively weak supervision, and thus would be easily learned by a miniaturized model. However, we find that the representation of a converged heavy model is still a strong constraint for training a small student model, which leads to a higher lower bound of congruence loss. In this work, we consider the knowledge distillation from the perspective of curriculum learning by teacher's routing. Instead of supervising the student model with a converged teacher model, we supervised it with some anchor points selected from the route in parameter space that the teacher model passed by, as we called route constrained optimization (RCO). We experimentally demonstrate this simple operation greatly reduces the lower bound of congruence loss for knowledge distillation, hint and mimicking learning. On close-set classification tasks like CIFAR and ImageNet, RCO improves knowledge distillation by 2.14% and 1.5% respectively. For the sake of evaluating the generalization, we also test RCO on the open-set face recognition task MegaFace. RCO achieves 84.3% accuracy on one-to-million task with only 0.8 M parameters, which push the SOTA by a large margin.},

  pages={6727-6735},
  abstract={Recently, consistency-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised learning (SSL). These methods always involve two roles, an explicit or implicit teacher model and a student model, and penalize predictions under different perturbations by a consistency constraint. However, the weights of these two roles are tightly coupled since the teacher is essentially an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student. In this work, we show that the coupled EMA teacher causes a performance bottleneck. To address this problem, we introduce Dual Student, which replaces the teacher with another student. We also define a novel concept, stable sample, following which a stabilization constraint is designed for our structure to be trainable. Further, we discuss two variants of our method, which produce even higher performance. Extensive experiments show that our method improves the classification performance significantly on several main SSL benchmarks. Specifically, it reduces the error rate of the 13-layer CNN from 16.84% to 12.39% on CIFAR-10 with 1k labels and from 34.10% to 31.56% on CIFAR-100 with 10k labels. In addition, our method also achieves a clear improvement in domain adaptation.},

  abstract={High-quality computer vision models typically address the problem of understanding the general distribution of real-world images. However, most cameras observe only a very small fraction of this distribution. This offers the possibility of achieving more efficient inference by specializing compact, low-cost models to the specific distribution of frames observed by a single camera. In this paper, we employ the technique of model distillation (supervising a low-cost student model using the output of a high-cost teacher) to specialize accurate, low-cost semantic segmentation models to a target video stream. Rather than learn a specialized student model on offline data from the video stream, we train the student in an online fashion on the live video, intermittently running the teacher to provide a target for learning. Online model distillation yields semantic segmentation models that closely approximate their Mask R-CNN teacher with 7 to 17× lower inference runtime cost (11 to 26× in FLOPs), even when the target video's distribution is non-stationary. Our method requires no offline pretraining on the target video stream, achieves higher accuracy and lower cost than solutions based on flow or video object segmentation, and can exhibit better temporal stability than the original teacher. We also provide a new video dataset for evaluating the efficiency of inference over long running video streams.},

  pages={4571-4580},
  abstract={We deal with the problem of modality distillation for the purpose of remote sensing (RS) image classification by exploring the deep generative models. From the remote sensing perspective, this problem can also be considered in line with the missing bands problem frequently encountered due to sensor abnormality. It is expected that different modalities provide useful complementary information regarding a given task, thus leading to the training of a robust prediction model. Although training data may be collected from different sensor modalities, it is many a time possible that not all the information are readily available during the model inference phase. This paper tackles the problem by proposing a novel adversarial training driven hallucination architecture which is capable of learning discriminative feature representations corresponding to the missing modalities from the available ones during the test time. To this end, we follow a teacher-student model where the teacher is trained on the multimodal data (learning with privileged information) and the student model learns to subsequently distill the feature descriptors corresponding to the missing modality. Experimental results obtained on the benchmark hyperspectral (HSI) datasets and another dataset of multispectral (MS)-panchromatic (PAN) image pairs confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach. In particular, we find that the student model is consistently able to surpass the performance of the teacher model for HSI datasets.},

  abstract={Recently, instance segmentation models have been developed to a great promising accuracy on public benchmarks. However, these models are too heavy to be applied for real applications due to their low inference speed. In this paper, we propose a faster instance segmentation model utilizing a teacher-student learning framework that transfers the knowledge obtained by a well-trained teacher model to a lightweight student model. In addition to the conventional strategy of knowledge distillation in classification or semantic segmentation networks which are both single-task networks, we investigate a hierarchical distillation (H-Dis) framework for structure information distillation on multi-task learning based instance segmentation. H-Dis consists of two distillation schemes: representation distillation that distills pair-wise quantized feature maps shared by multi-heads, and semantic distillation that makes sure to distill each head information in an instance level. In particular, we present channel-wise distillation for the segmentation head to achieve instance-level mask knowledge transfer. To evaluate our approach, we carry out experiments with different settings of distillation methods on different datasets Pascal VOC and Cityscapes. Our experiments prove that our approach is effective for accelerating instance segmentation models with less accuracy drop under limited computing resources.},

  abstract={Attention-based encoder-decoder models significantly reduce the burden of developing multilingual speech recognition systems. By means of end-to-end modeling and parameters sharing, a single model can be efficiently trained and deployed for all languages. Although the single model benefits from jointly training across different languages, it should handle the variation and diversity of the languages at the same time. In this paper, we exploit knowledge distillation from multiple teachers to improve the recognition accuracy of the end-to-end multilingual model. Considering that teacher models learning from monolingual and multilingual data contain distinct knowledge of specific languages, we introduce multiple teachers including monolingual teachers of each language, and multilingual teacher to teach a same sized multilingual student model so that the multilingual student will learn various knowledge embedded in the data and intend to outperform multilingual teacher. Different from conventional knowledge distillation which usually relies on a linear interpolation for hard loss from true label and soft losses from teachers, a new random augmented training strategy is proposed to switch the optimization of the student model between hard or soft losses in random order. Our experiments on Wall Street Journal (English) and AISHELL-1 (Chinese) composed multilingual speech dataset show the proposed multiple teachers and distillation strategy boost the performance of the student significantly relative to the multilingual teacher.},

  abstract={This paper to Practice Full Paper presents about a procedure to generate the learners' data using a learner model based on first-order lag system to generate learners data. By using the generated data, the learners are classified into several groups and some learners with low understanding degree can be extracted by using the neural networks. It is necessary to provide learning support corresponding to the understanding degree of each learner in a class to improve effective learning. By providing additional education for the learners who are predicted as low degree by the proposed procedure, it is expected to take countermeasures for not becoming “dropout students” in early stage. For this purpose, predicting the understanding degree is important, and this paper employs a recurrent neural network as the predictor. Hayashida et al. (2018) have constructed to classify the learners by understanding degree at the end of the class based on some observed data such as result of quizzes, or report tasks by using FNN (Feedforward Neural Network). This paper uses a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) which consists of feedforward signal processing and structure of the signal feedbacks because of the observed data is time-series data. This paper proposes a learner model based on first-order lag system to generate learner data for training RNNs. As experimental result of the simulation, this paper succeeds in extracting the learner group with low understanding degree in future.},

  abstract={With the development of network technology and data mining technology, personalized learning path recommendation in intelligent teaching system has become an important issue. Choosing the right learning object and recommending it to learners is a challenge for online learning systems. At present, the problem faced by online learning is that the information overload causes the learner cannot find a learning resource suitable for himself, and the recommended learning resource cannot satisfy the individual needs of the learner. The recommendation system is an important means of information filtering and a very promising method for solving information overload problems. Therefore, adaptive learning path recommendation is considered to be an effective means to solve the above problems in online learning. In this paper, we propose a learning path generation algorithm based on network embedding and learning effects. First, we use the network embedding to learn the user's expression in order to judge the learner's similarity. Then we generate an adaptive learning path for current learners based on the similarity between all historical learners and current learners and the learning effects of historical learners. The experimental results show that the average grade of the learners using our recommended learning path has been greatly improved. (Abstract)},

It is not possible to dynamically monitor user interest drift. In this work, we propose a user model named Attention-Based User Temporal Model (AUTM). The key design of our work is to use the attention model to dynamically assign importance weights to user embedding of RNN network outputs at different times, and then combine the static user embedding.

In adaptive exercises, the next problem to be solved by a student is chosen by considering her performance during learning. Unlike former ITS that is mostly based on students' knowledge, the proposed ITS uses students' knowledge and misconceptions to perform adaptation.

  abstract={Intelligent Tutoring Systems are promising tools for delivering optimal and personalized learning experiences to students. A key component for their personalization is the student model, which infers the knowledge level of the students to balance the difficulty of the exercises. While important advances have been achieved, several challenges remain. In particular, the models should be able to track in real-time the evolution of the students' knowledge levels. These evolutions are likely to follow different profiles for each student, while measuring the exact knowledge level remains difficult given the limited and noisy information provided by the interactions. This paper introduces a novel model that addresses these challenges with three contributions:. 1) the model relies on Gaussian Processes to track online the evolution of the student's knowledge level over time, 2) it uses collaborative filtering to rapidly provide long-term predictions by leveraging the information from previous users, and 3) it automatically generates abstract representations of knowledge components via automatic relevance determination of covariance matrices. The model is evaluated on three datasets, including real users. The results demonstrate that the model converges to accurate predictions in average four times faster than the compared methods.},

  abstract={Intelligent learning environments can be designed to support the development of learners' cognitive skills, strategies, and metacognitive processes as they work on complex decision-making and problem-solving tasks. However, the complexity of the tasks may impede the progress of novice learners. Providing adaptive feedback to learners who face difficulties requires learner modeling approaches that can identify learners' proficiencies and the difficulties they face in executing required skills, strategies, and metacognitive processes. This paper discusses a multilevel hierarchical learner modeling scheme that analyzes and captures learners' cognitive processes and problem-solving strategies along with their performance on assigned tasks in a game-based environment called UrbanSim that requires complex decision making for dealing with counterinsurgency scenarios. As the scenario evolves in a turn-by-turn fashion, UrbanSim evaluates the learners' moves using a number of performance measures. Our learner modeling scheme interprets the reported performance values by analyzing the learners' activities captured in log files to derive learners' proficiencies in associated cognitive skills and strategies, and updates the learner model. We discuss the details of the learner modeling algorithms in this paper, and then demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting results from a study we conducted at Vanderbilt University.},

  abstract={This letter proposes a deep learning model to deal with the spatial transfer challenge for the mapping of irrigated areas through the analysis of Sentinel-1 data. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model called “Teacher Model” is trained on a source geographical area characterized by a huge volume of samples. Then, this model is transferred from the source area to the target area characterized by a limited number of samples. The transfer learning framework is based on a distill and refine strategy, in which the teacher model is first distilled into a student model and, successively, refined by data samples coming from the target geographical area. The proposed strategy is compared with different approaches including a random forest (RF) classifier trained on the target data set and a CNN trained on the source data set and directly applied on the target area as well as several CNN classifiers trained on the target data set. The evaluation of the performed transfer strategy shows that the “distill and refine” framework obtains the best performance compared with other competing approaches. The obtained findings represent a first step toward the understanding of the spatial transferability of deep learning models in the Earth observation domain.},

  abstract={Visual food recognition on mobile devices has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its roles in individual diet monitoring and social health management and analysis. Existing visual food recognition approaches usually use large server-based networks to achieve high accuracy. However, these networks are not compact enough to be deployed on mobile devices. Even though some compact architectures have been proposed, most of them are unable to obtain the performance of full-size networks. In view of this, this paper proposes a Joint-learning Distilled Network (JDNet) that targets to achieve a high food recognition accuracy of a compact student network by learning from a large teacher network, while retaining a compact network size. Compared to the conventional one-directional knowledge distillation methods, the proposed JDNet has a novel joint-learning framework where the large teacher network and the small student network are trained simultaneously, by leveraging on different intermediate layer features in both network. JDNet introduces a new Multi-Stage Knowledge Distillation (MSKD) for simultaneous student-teacher training at different levels of abstraction. A new Instance Activation Learning (IAL) is also proposed to jointly train student and teacher on instance activation map of each training sample. Experimental results show that the trained student model is able to achieve a state-of-the-art Top-1 recognition accuracy on the benchmark UECFood-256 and Food-101 datasets at 84.0% and 91.2%, respectively, and retaining a 4x smaller network size for mobile deployment.},

  abstract={Digital twin can be defined as a virtual representation of a physical asset enabled through data and simulators for real-time prediction, optimization, monitoring, controlling, and improved decision making. Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent status of methodologies and techniques related to the construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges and enabling technologies along with recommendations and reflections for various stakeholders.},

  pages={26637-26664},
  abstract={Our research work describes a team of human Digital Twins (DTs), each tracking fitness-related measurements describing an athlete's behavior in consecutive days (e.g. food income, activity, sleep). After collecting enough measurements, the DT firstly predicts the physical twin performance during training and, in case of non-optimal result, it suggests modifications in the athlete's behavior. The athlete's team is integrated into SmartFit, a software framework for supporting trainers and coaches in monitoring and manage athletes' fitness activity and results. Through IoT sensors embedded in wearable devices and applications for manual logging (e.g. mood, food income), SmartFit continuously captures measurements, initially treated as the dynamic data describing the current physical twins' status. Dynamic data allows adapting each DT's status and triggering the DT's predictions and suggestions. The analyzed measurements are stored as the historical data, further processed by the DT to update (increase) its knowledge and ability to provide reliable predictions. Results show that, thanks to the team of DTs, SmartFit computes trustable predictions of the physical twins' conditions and produces understandable suggestions which can be used by trainers to trigger optimization actions in the athletes' behavior. Though applied in the sport context, SmartFit can be easily adapted to other monitoring tasks.},

  year={2020},
  volume={8},

  pages={38032-38044},
  abstract={One of the most commonly method for sound event detection is the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) or convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) and their variants. However, the pooling operation of the CNN has the disadvantage of losing the location information of the target object. We don't use the pooling operation, retaining ReLU and convolution operation, and we use the dictionary strong constraints and penalty function prior constraints of the multi-layer convolutional sparse coding (ML-CSC). We proposed iterative deep neural networks, the unfolded multi-layer local block coordinate descent networks (ML-LoBCoD-NET), driven by the multi-layer local block coordinate descent algorithm (ML-LoBCoD) which is extended from the local block coordinate descent (LoBCoD) algorithm. The ML-LoBCoD-NET can extract features different from the CNN. More importantly, for weakly-supervised sound event detection task, we proposed the MRNN-Att network which combines the ML-LoBCoD-NET, a recurrent neural network (RNN), and an attention network. The MCRNN-Att network combines MRNN-Att and CRNN network for fusing the different features. Furthermore, for semi-supervised sound event detection task, the MRNN-Att mean teacher model (MRNN-Att-MT) and the MCRNN-Att mean teacher model (MCRNN-Att-MT) are proposed, in which the MRNN-Att and the MCRNN-Att network are selected as the student model. These models were tested on the dataset of Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2018 Task 4. The F1 score of the MRNN-Att-MT on the development set was 22.83%, which was 8.77% higher than the baseline system. The score of the MRNN-Att-MT on the evaluation set was 15.68%, which was 4.88% higher than the baseline system. The MCRNN-Att-MT model had an F1 score of 20.35% on the development set, which was 6.29% higher than the baseline system and the F1 score of 14.56% on the evaluation set, which was 3.76% higher than the baseline system.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant advances in computer vision and sensor-based smart sensing. DNNs achieve prominent results based on standard data sets and powerful servers, whereas, in real applications with domain-shift data and resource-constrained environments such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in the edge computing, DNNs are likely to have degraded performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. To this end, we develop the MobileDA framework that learns transferable features while keeping the simple structure of the deep model. Our method allows a novel teacher network trained in the server to distill the knowledge for a student network running in the edge device, which is achieved by a cross-domain distillation. Leveraging unlabeled data in the new environment, our student model amends the feature learning to be domain invariant, then being our objective model running in the edge device. Our approach is evaluated on a challenging IoT-based WiFi gesture recognition scenario, and three classic visual adaptation benchmarks. The empirical studies corroborate the effectiveness of distillation for domain transfer, and the overall results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance merely using a simple network.},

  abstract={This overview outlines key issues in learning with an open learner model (OLM). Originally, learner models remained hidden, as their primary role was to enable a system to personalize the educational interaction. Opening the model in an understandable form provides additional methods of prompting reflection, planning, and other metacognitive activities that are important in learning. Learner-system discussion, editing or other interaction about the learner model can allow users to contribute more directly to the modeling process to increase its accuracy, while at the same time, further facilitating reflection as they justify their viewpoints to themselves and the system. Social learning can be supported by opening learner models to peers, helping learners to gauge their relative progress, and effectively seek collaborators. OLMs can also provide useful information to others supporting the learning process, such as teachers and parents. OLMs are set to take an increasing role as new learning technologies develop.},

  abstract={Purveyors of malicious network attacks continue to increase the complexity and the sophistication of their techniques, and their ability to evade detection continues to improve as well. Hence, intrusion detection systems must also evolve to meet these increasingly challenging threats. Machine learning is often used to support this needed improvement. However, training a good prediction model can require a large set of labeled training data. Such datasets are difficult to obtain because privacy concerns prevent the majority of intrusion detection agencies from sharing their sensitive data. In this paper, we propose the use of mimic learning to enable the transfer of intrusion detection knowledge through a teacher model trained on private data to a student model. This student model provides a mean of publicly sharing knowledge extracted from private data without sharing the data itself. Our results confirm that the proposed scheme can produce a student intrusion detection model that mimics the teacher model without requiring access to the original dataset.},

  abstract={Deep-learning based speech separation models confront poor generalization problem that even the state-of-the-art models could abruptly fail when evaluating them in mismatch conditions. To address this problem, we propose an easy-to-implement yet effective consistency based semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach, namely Mixup-Breakdown training (MBT). It learns a teacher model to "breakdown" unlabeled inputs, and the estimated separations are interpolated to produce more useful pseudo "mixup" input-output pairs, on which the consistency regularization could apply for learning a student model. In our experiment, we evaluate MBT under various conditions with ascending degrees of mismatch, including unseen interfering speech, noise, and music, and compare MBT’s generalization capability against state-of-the-art supervised learning and SSL approaches. The result indicates that MBT significantly outperforms several strong baselines with up to 13.77% relative SI-SNRi improvement. Moreover, MBT only adds negligible computational overhead to standard training schemes.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD) approach is widely used in the deep learning field mainly for model size reduction. KD utilizes soft labels of teacher model, which contain the dark- knowledge that one-hot ground-truth does not have. This knowledge can improve the performance of already saturated student model. In case of multiple-teacher models, generally, the same weighted average (interpolated training) of multiple-teacher's labels is applied to KD training. However, if the knowledge characteristics among teachers are somewhat different, the interpolated training can be at risk of crushing each knowledge characteristics and can also raise noise component. In this paper, we propose an entropy based KD training, which utilizes the teacher model labels with lower entropy at a larger rate among the various teacher models. The proposed method shows a better performance than the conventional KD training scheme in automatic speech recognition.},

  abstract={Despite advances in neural language modeling, obtaining a good model on a large scale multi-domain dataset still remains a difficult task. We propose training methods for building neural language models for such a task, which are not only domain robust, but reasonable in model size and fast for evaluation. We combine knowledge distillation from pretrained domain expert language models with the noise contrastive estimation (NCE) loss. Knowledge distillation allows to train a single student model which is both compact and domain robust, while the use of NCE loss makes the model self-normalized, which enables fast evaluation. We conduct experiments on a large English multi-domain speech recognition dataset provided by AppTek. The resulting student model is of the size of one domain expert, while it gives similar perplexities as various teacher models on their expert domain; the model is self-normalized, allowing for 30% faster first pass decoding than the naive models which require the full soft- max computation, and finally it gives improvements of more than 8% relative in terms of word error rate over a large multidomain 4-gram count model trained on more than 10 B words.},

  abstract={We propose a simple but efficient method termed Guided Learning for weakly-labeled semi-supervised sound event detection (SED). There are two sub-targets implied in weakly-labeled SED: audio tagging and boundary detection. Instead of designing a single model by considering a trade-off between the two sub-targets, we design a teacher model aiming at audio tagging to guide a student model aiming at boundary detection to learn using the unlabeled data. The guidance is guaranteed by the audio tagging performance gap of the two models. In the meantime, the student model liberated from the trade-off is able to provide more excellent boundary detection results. We propose a principle to design such two models based on the relation between the temporal compression scale and the two sub-targets. We also propose an end-to-end semi-supervised learning process for these two models to enable their abilities to rise alternately. Experiments on the DCASE2018 Task4 dataset show that our approach achieves competitive performance.},

  abstract={Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable accuracy improvements for automatic modulation classification. However, the employed networks often have millions of parameters and need very high computation, which makes it difficult to deploy these models on portable devices with limited resources. We propose a cross model deep learning scheme to build a lightweight deep network for accurate modulation classification. Firstly, a large Hybrid DNN (HDNN) that is composed of convolutional and recurrent layers is constructed and trained for automatic and accurate classification of signals. Then we build a smaller Layered Resnet Network (LRN) with shallow layers and few nodes. The HDNN and LRN are taken as a Teacher Model (TM) and a Student Model (SM) respectively. Finally, a knowledge distillation method is proposed to guide the learning of the SM, by formulating a teaching loss from the prediction of the TM to train the SM. The performances of the proposed HDNN and LRN are investigated on the public RadioML2016.10a and RadioML2016.10b data sets. The experimental results show that the trained HDNN presents state-of-the-art classification results and the LRN trained in this scheme takes only about a sixth of the HDNN's inference time and consumes only 472.3KB for storage, with a slight accuracy decrease compared with the large HDNN.},

  pages={231-236},
  abstract={Electronic health records (EHR) systems contain vast amounts of medical information about patients. These data can be used to train machine learning models that can predict health status, as well as to help prevent future diseases or disabilities. However, getting patients' medical data to obtain well-trained machine learning models is a challenging task. This is because sharing the patients' medical records is prohibited by law in most countries due to patients privacy concerns. In this paper, we tackle this problem by sharing the models instead of the original sensitive data by using the mimic learning approach. The idea is first to train a model on the original sensitive data, called the teacher model. Then, using this model, we can transfer its knowledge to another model, called the student model, without the need to learn the original data used in training the teacher model. The student model is then shared to the public and can be used to make accurate predictions. To assess the mimic learning approach, we have evaluated our scheme using different medical datasets. The results indicate that the student model mimics the teacher model performance in terms of prediction accuracy without the need to access to the patients' original data records.},

  abstract={Face recognition in the wild is now advancing towards light-weight models, fast inference speed and resolution-adapted capability. In this paper, we propose a bridge distillation approach to turn a complex face model pretrained on private high-resolution faces into a light-weight one for low-resolution face recognition. In our approach, such a cross-dataset resolution-adapted knowledge transfer problem is solved via two-step distillation. In the first step, we conduct cross-dataset distillation to transfer the prior knowledge from private high-resolution faces to public high-resolution faces and generate compact and discriminative features. In the second step, the resolution-adapted distillation is conducted to further transfer the prior knowledge to synthetic low-resolution faces via multi-task learning. By learning low-resolution face representations and mimicking the adapted high-resolution knowledge, a light-weight student model can be constructed with high efficiency and promising accuracy in recognizing low-resolution faces. Experimental results show that the student model performs impressively in recognizing low-resolution faces with only 0.21M parameters and 0.057MB memory. Meanwhile, its speed reaches up to 14,705, 934 and 763 faces per second on GPU, CPU and mobile phone, respectively.},

  year={2020},
  volume={39},
  number={8},
  pages={2653-2663},
  abstract={Segmentation of pneumonia lesions from CT scans of COVID-19 patients is important for accurate diagnosis and follow-up. Deep learning has a potential to automate this task but requires a large set of high-quality annotations that are difficult to collect. Learning from noisy training labels that are easier to obtain has a potential to alleviate this problem. To this end, we propose a novel noise-robust framework to learn from noisy labels for the segmentation task. We first introduce a noise-robust Dice loss that is a generalization of Dice loss for segmentation and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss for robustness against noise, then propose a novel COVID-19 Pneumonia Lesion segmentation network (COPLE-Net) to better deal with the lesions with various scales and appearances. The noise-robust Dice loss and COPLE-Net are combined with an adaptive self-ensembling framework for training, where an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of a student model is used as a teacher model that is adaptively updated by suppressing the contribution of the student to EMA when the student has a large training loss. The student model is also adaptive by learning from the teacher only when the teacher outperforms the student. Experimental results showed that: (1) our noise-robust Dice loss outperforms existing noise-robust loss functions, (2) the proposed COPLE-Net achieves higher performance than state-of-the-art image segmentation networks, and (3) our framework with adaptive self-ensembling significantly outperforms a standard training process and surpasses other noise-robust training approaches in the scenario of learning from noisy labels for COVID-19 pneumonia lesion segmentation.},

  abstract={SDVN is a promising architecture to extend the computation resources which break through the limitations of current vehicular networks. It is possible to learn new networking schemes by observing the surrounding environment in SDVN. However, within SDVN, the construction and application of such schemes still lack proper consideration in data collection, prediction, verification, and validation before applying these schemes in the real network, which is due to the limited knowledge of the physical environment. Intelligent Digital Twin (IDT) was initially designed for realizing intelligent manufacturing by virtualizing and learning the data of the physical space in cyberspace. Hence, bringing IDT to networking can provide additional valuable functionalities to meet the above considerations by constructing a virtual intelligent network space, aiming to realize the iterative update of the networking schemes in an adaptive way. In this article, we introduce a new network architecture, IDT-SDVN, by maximizing the advantages of SDVNs. We present the challenges and open issues of IDT-SDVNs. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of SDVNs. The experimental results show that significant improvement of performance is achieved for vehicular networking with the proposed IDT-SDVNs.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD) is a new method for transferring knowledge of a structure under training to another one. The conventional application of KD is in the form of learning a small model (named as a student) by soft labels produced by a complex model (named as a teacher). Due to the novel idea introduced in KD, recently, its notion is used in different methods such as compression and processes that are going to enhance the model accuracy. Although different techniques are proposed in the area of KD, there is a lack of a model to generalize KD techniques. In this paper, various studies in the scope of KD are investigated and analyzed to build a general model for KD. All the methods and techniques in KD can be summarized through the proposed model. By utilizing the proposed model, different methods in KD are better investigated and explored. The advantages and disadvantages of different approaches in KD can be better understood and developing a new strategy for KD can be possible. Using the proposed model, different KD methods are represented in an abstract view.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT) is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in various industries. It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the “softwarization” of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.},

  abstract={The concepts of Digital Twin has been recently introduced, it refers to functional connections between a complex physical system and its high-fidelity digital replica. Digital Twin process workflow is proposed in case of Mohammed VI Bridge modeling in Morocco. The current maintenance of a road infrastructure is based on a manual inspection and a system based on traditional tools. Aging infrastructures require a new approach to maintenance in terms of inspection, bridge maintenance system, simulation and systematic evaluation. This system now exists and is called the Digital Twin. Digital Twin can be thought of as a virtual prototype in service that changes dynamically in near real time as its physical twin changes. An urban infrastructure digital twin is a virtual instance of his physical twin that is continuously updated with multisource, multisensor and multitemporal data that can be used for monitoring, simulating and forecasting any potential problem that may appear in the structure and proposing planning for repair and maintenance of health status throughout the life cycle of this infrastructure. This work presents a general vision and a justification for integrating DT technology with geospatial data. The paper examines the benefits of integrating 3D GIS data acquired by automated mobile mapping (MMS) workflows for modeling the reality of a major bridge infrastructure in Morocco. This allowed to study the future performance of this bridge structure on virtual twin structures under different environmental conditions. Cloud point data are acquired by a Mobile Mapping System on Mohammed VI Bridge and converted in BIM model by a scan to BIM process and is integrated in a GIS and BIM virtual environment and shows the efficiency of volumetric auscultation in terms of surface flatness and distortion inspection. This project provides a new bridge maintenance system using the concept of a Digital Twin. This digital model is a platform that allows to collect, organize and share the maintenance history of this important road infrastructure in Morocco.},

  abstract={This paper investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile-edge computing (MEC) system, in which the UAV provides complementary computation resource to the terrestrial MEC system. The UAV processes the received computation tasks from the mobile users (MUs) by creating the corresponding virtual machines. Due to finite shared I/O resource of the UAV in the MEC system, each MU competes to schedule local as well as remote task computations across the decision epochs, aiming to maximize the expected long-term computation performance. The non-cooperative interactions among the MUs are modeled as a stochastic game, in which the decision makings of a MU depend on the global state statistics and the task scheduling policies of all MUs are coupled. To approximate the Nash equilibrium solutions, we propose a proactive scheme based on the long short-term memory and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. A digital twin of the MEC system is established to train the proactive DRL scheme offline. Using the proposed scheme, each MU makes task scheduling decisions only with its own information. Numerical experiments show a significant performance gain from the scheme in terms of average utility per MU across the decision epochs.},

  abstract={Agriculture is facing a period of unprecedented change resulting from the requirement to feed c. 10 billion mouths by 2050, while operating in a challenging business environment with increasing sustainability and consumer expectations. To meet these challenges many are looking to industry 4.0 technology as a solution, specifically the combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and in-field robotics. Although there have been successful prototypes from a functional perspective and promising start-ups, the complex nature of the agriculture system of systems creates a significant risk of mass adoption failure. The main risk stems from the majority of the hundreds of products being designed in isolation using closed hardware and software systems that are all aiming to serve the one farmer or grower. The current silo’d technology adoption approach is heading towards problems with usability, availability, viability, interoperability and adaptability. This paper proposes a new time constrained System of Systems (SoS) discovery process and supporting SoS Canvas, developed with the objective of increasing the adoption of SoS principles with non-technical stakeholders. The time constrained SoS discovery process consists of raising awareness, capturing data, modelling the SoS, modelling the System of Interest (SoI) and providing recommendations, often based on common challenges and opportunities from the SoS Canvas. The outcome of this initial case study prototyping the process, is a set of SysML diagrams demonstrating how the constituent systems currently contribute to emergent properties and recommendations to improve both the SoI and the SoS. Future research will focus on interoperability within agricultural technology (Agritech) and the potential for a SoS level digital twin, providing the capability to manage and optimise emergent properties for the betterment of all.},

  abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems are becoming more autonomous, interconnected, complex and adaptive, and are expected to operate in highly dynamic environments. This is especially challenging for energy ecosystems that are increasingly difficult to control and maintain as the number of participating manufacturers and users grows. Digital Twins help analyze and predict these systems in the form of digital reflections that operate in parallel with the physical system. In this paper, we use Machine Learning to improve the predictive power of Digital Twins for Cyber-Physical Energy Systems. Specifically, we use a Temporal Convolutional Neural Network model to learn the temporal patterns in the system and predict its responsiveness to specific power setpoint instructions. Real-life data from ten batteries were used to predict the behavior over time. Compared to the baseline model that uses the prior probability of response and the average response rate within the configured time window, the model predicts the batteries’ responsiveness more accurately. The more temporal information is used as input for prediction, the better the model performs in both precision and recall. The results show that this compensates for the lack of information when fewer metrics are used. The use of Machine Learning for Digital Twins can help maintain a heterogeneous energy ecosystem, while minimizing the need to acquire or disclose detailed information.},

  abstract={Constructing an effective architecture based on digital twins using advanced artificial intelligent technologies remains a key challenge in smart power distribution system. Despite recent advances in important domains such as device health maintenance and manufacturing process, the conventional architecture does not offer a satisfactory solution for rapidly providing data models, a set of analytics or algorithms, and knowledge. In this work, we employ ideas from distributed network based on digital twins and from recent advances that augment artificial intelligent with big data. Our architecture provides a paradigm that uses a distributed network makes computer programming, software, and data spread out across more than one terminal, but communicate complex messages through terminal nodes, and are dependent upon each other, obviating the pressure from master station. We demonstrate the usefulness of digital twins that are used to track the performance of devices such as transformer during normal operation to detect possible defects and fix them before they result in failure. We also conclude that using digital twin technology will understand, predict, and optimize performance in order to achieve improved business outcomes, and apply machine learning and knowledge to predict the future.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks are capable of learning powerful representation, but often limited by heavy network architectures and high computational cost. Knowledge distillation (KD) is one of the effective ways to perform model compression and inference acceleration. But the final student models remain parameter redundancy. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel approach, called Variational Bayesian Group-level Sparsification for Knowledge Distillation (VBGS-KD), to distill a large teacher network into a small and sparse student network while preserving accuracy. We impose the sparsity-inducing prior on the groups of parameters in the student model, and introduce the variational Bayesian approximation to learn structural sparseness, which can effectively prune most part of weights. The prune threshold is learned during training without extra fine-tuning. The proposed method can learn the robust student networks that have achieved satisifying accuracy and compact sizes compared with the state-of-the-arts methods. We have validated our method on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, observing 90.3% sparsity with 0.19% accuracy boosting in MNIST. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

The trend is headed towards automation and connectivity. In the automotive industry, advancements have been made towards integrating autonomous driving vehicles into Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) with the use of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs). The purpose of this type of network is to enable efficient communication between vehicles ( V2V communication) or vehicles and infrastructure (V2I communication), to improve driving safety, to avoid traffic congestion, and to better coordinate transport networks. This direction towards limited (or lack of) human intervention implies vulnerability to cyber attacks. In this context, this paper provides a comprehensive classification of related state-of-the-art approaches following three key directions: privacy, authentication and message integrity within VANETs.

  abstract={A Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) is a type of engineering diagram that uses symbols, text, and lines to represent the components and flow of an industrial process. Although used universally across industries such as manufacturing and oil & gas, P&IDs are usually trapped in image files with limited metadata, making their contents unsearchable and siloed from operational or enterprise systems. In order to extract the information contained in these diagrams, we propose a pipeline for automatically digitizing P&IDs. Our pipeline combines a series of computer vision techniques to detect symbols in a diagram, match symbols with associated text, and detect connections between symbols through lines. For the symbol detection task, we train a Convolutional Neural Network to classify certain common symbols with over 90% precision and recall. To detect connections between symbols, we use a graph search approach to traverse a diagram through its lines and discover interconnected symbols. By transforming unstructured diagrams into structured information, our pipeline enables applications such as diagram search, equipment-to-sensor mapping, and asset hierarchy creation. When integrated with operational and enterprise data, the extracted asset hierarchy serves as the foundation for a facility-wide digital twin, enabling advanced applications such as machine learning-based predictive maintenance.},

In the second part, the students use the dedicated software environment to edit projects on their own, and at this point the PBL approach is used. This method enables students to self-organize their learning process and take an active part in the seminar. The idea for the seminar and virtual teaching lab evolved from the industrial use case of testing software for programmable logic controllers (PLCs) without the real machine, using virtual commissioning (VC). The primary effort of VC lies in the manual creation of a digital representation of each mechatronic component providing the same behavior seen from PLC perspective.

  year={2020},
  volume={},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={A real world Industrial IoT set up has paved way for simultaneous monitoring of several sensors at their unique sampling rates. This has realized the need for artificial intelligence tools for robust data processing. However, the large size of input data requires real time monitoring and synchronization for online analysis. As the star concept behind the Industry 4.0 wave, a digital twin is a virtual, multi-scale and probabilistic simulation to mirror the performance of its physical counterpart and serve the product lifecycle in a virtual space. Evidently, a digital twin can proactively identify potential issues with its corresponding real twin. Thus, it is best suited for enabling a physics-based and data-driven model fusion to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the components. Traditional RUL prediction approaches have assumed either an exponential or linear degradation trend with a fixed curve shape to build a Health Index (HI) model. Such an assumption may not be useful for multi-sensor systems or cases where sensor data is available intermittently. A common constraint in the industry is irregular sensor data collection. The resulting asynchronous time series of the sporadic data needs to be an accurate representation of the component's HI when constructing a degradation model. In this paper, we extend the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique to generate RUL prediction within a digital twin framework as a means of synchronization with changing operational states. More specifically, we first use LSTM encoder-decoder (LSTM-ED) to train a multilayered neural network and reconstruct the sensor data time series corresponding to a healthy state. The resulting reconstruction error can be used to capture patterns in input data time series and estimate HI of training and testing sets. Using a time lag to record similarity between the HI curves, a weighted average of the final RUL estimation is obtained. The described empirical approach is evaluated on publicly available engine degradation dataset with run-to-failure information. Results indicate a high RUL estimation accuracy with greater error reduction rate. This demonstrates wide applicability of the discussed methodology to various industries where event data is scarce for the application of only data-driven techniques.},

  abstract={With increasing ethical and legal concerns on privacy for deep models in visual recognition, differential privacy has emerged as a mechanism to disguise membership of sensitive data in training datasets. Recent methods like Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) leverage a large ensemble of teacher models trained on disjoint subsets of private data, to transfer knowledge to a student model with privacy guarantees. However, labeled vision data is often expensive and datasets, when split into many disjoint training sets, lead to significantly sub-optimal accuracy and thus hardly sustain good privacy bounds. We propose a practically data-efficient scheme based on private release of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) queries, which altogether avoids splitting the training dataset. Our approach allows the use of privacy-amplification by subsampling and iterative refinement of the kNN feature embedding. We rigorously analyze the theoretical properties of our method and demonstrate strong experimental performance on practical computer vision datasets for face attribute recognition and person reidentification. In particular, we achieve comparable or better accuracy than PATE while reducing more than 90% of the privacy loss, thereby providing the “most practical method to-date” for private deep learning in computer vision.},

  abstract={Standard Knowledge Distillation (KD) approaches distill the knowledge of a cumbersome teacher model into the parameters of a student model with a pre-defined architecture. However, the knowledge of a neural network, which is represented by the network's output distribution conditioned on its input, depends not only on its parameters but also on its architecture. Hence, a more generalized approach for KD is to distill the teacher's knowledge into both the parameters and architecture of the student. To achieve this, we present a new \textit{Architecture-aware Knowledge Distillation (AKD)} approach that finds student models (pearls for the teacher) that are best for distilling the given teacher model. In particular, we leverage Neural Architecture Search (NAS), equipped with our KD-guided reward, to search for the best student architectures for a given teacher. Experimental results show our proposed AKD consistently outperforms the conventional NAS plus KD approach, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet classification task under various latency settings. Furthermore, the best AKD student architecture for the ImageNet classification task also transfers well to other tasks such as million level face recognition and ensemble learning.},

Input gradients characterize how small changes at each input pixel affect the model output. Using only natural images, we show here that training a student model's input gradients to match those of a robust teacher model can gain robustness close to a strong baseline that is robustly trained from scratch. Through experiments in MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, we show that our proposed method, input gradient adversarial matching, can transfer robustness across different tasks and even across different model architectures. This demonstrates that directly targeting the semantics of input gradients is a feasible way towards adversarial robustness.},

  abstract={Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods are capable of transferring the knowledge encoded in a large and complex teacher into a smaller and faster student. Early methods were usually limited to transferring the knowledge only between the last layers of the networks, while latter approaches were capable of performing multi-layer KD, further increasing the accuracy of the student. However, despite their improved performance, these methods still suffer from several limitations that restrict both their efficiency and flexibility. First, existing KD methods typically ignore that neural networks undergo through different learning phases during the training process, which often requires different types of supervision for each one. Furthermore, existing multi-layer KD methods are usually unable to effectively handle networks with significantly different architectures (heterogeneous KD). In this paper we propose a novel KD method that works by modeling the information flow through the various layers of the teacher model and then train a student model to mimic this information flow. The proposed method is capable of overcoming the aforementioned limitations by using an appropriate supervision scheme during the different phases of the training process, as well as by designing and training an appropriate auxiliary teacher model that acts as a proxy model capable of “explaining” the way the teacher works to the student. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using four image datasets and several different evaluation setups.},

  abstract={We present a simple self-training method that achieves 88.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which is 2.0% better than the state-of-the-art model that requires 3.5B weakly labeled Instagram images. On robustness test sets, it improves ImageNet-A top-1 accuracy from 61.0% to 83.7%, reduces ImageNet-C mean corruption error from 45.7 to 28.3, and reduces ImageNet-P mean flip rate from 27.8 to 12.2. To achieve this result, we first train an EfficientNet model on labeled ImageNet images and use it as a teacher to generate pseudo labels on 300M unlabeled images. We then train a larger EfficientNet as a student model on the combination of labeled and pseudo labeled images. We iterate this process by putting back the student as the teacher. During the generation of the pseudo labels, the teacher is not noised so that the pseudo labels are as accurate as possible. However, during the learning of the student, we inject noise such as dropout, stochastic depth and data augmentation via RandAugment to the student so that the student generalizes better than the teacher.},

  abstract={6G is envisioned to empower wireless communication and computation through the digitalization and connectivity of everything, by establishing a digital representation of the real network environment. Mobile edge computing (MEC), as one of the key enabling factors, meets unprecedented challenges during mobile offloading due to the extremely complicated and unpredictable network environment in 6G. The existing works on offloading in MEC mainly ignore the effects of user mobility and the unpredictable MEC environment. In this paper, we present a new vision of Digital Twin Edge Networks (DITEN) where digital twins (DTs) of edge servers estimate edge servers' states and DT of the entire MEC system provides training data for offloading decision. A mobile offloading scheme is proposed in DITEN to minimize the offloading latency under the constraints of accumulated consumed service migration cost during user mobility. The Lyapunov optimization method is leveraged to simplify the long-term migration cost constraint to a multi-objective dynamic optimization problem, which is then solved by Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning. Simulations results show that our proposed scheme effectively diminishes the average offloading latency, the offloading failure rate, and the service migration rate, as compared with benchmark schemes, while saving the system cost with DT assistance.},

  abstract={Compressing deep neural network (DNN) models becomes a very important and necessary technique for real-world applications, such as deploying those models on mobile devices. Knowledge distillation is one of the most popular methods for model compression, and many studies have been made on developing this technique. However, those studies mainly focused on classification problems, and very few attempts have been made on regression problems, although there are many application of DNNs on regression problems. In this paper, we propose a new formalism of knowledge distillation for regression problems. First, we propose a new loss function, teacher outlier rejection loss, which rejects outliers in training samples using teacher model predictions. Second, we consider a multi-task network with two outputs: one estimates training labels which is in general contaminated by noisy labels; And the other estimates teacher model's output which is expected to modify the noise labels following the memorization effects. By considering the multi-task network, training of the feature extraction of student models becomes more effective, and it allows us to obtain a better student model than one trained from scratch. We performed comprehensive evaluation with one simple toy model: sinusoidal function, and two open datasets: MPIIGaze, and Multi-PIE. Our results show consistent improvement in accuracy regardless of the annotation error level in the datasets.},

  abstract={Medical segmentation is a significant task since it provides valuable information for diagnosis. In the recent years, convolutional neural networks have achieved great success in this field. However, the number of medical images is often limited which cannot support large networks to be trained. Thus, overfitting is much more common in medical images than other tasks. Also, to get annotated images is very costly and time-consuming. We stimulate an extreme condition where the number of the sample is so limited that we adopt a Mean Teacher Model to avoid overfitting. We build two models - student and teacher, with same structure and alternatively trained. We apply consistency loss to update the parameters of student and use Exponential Moving Average to compute parameters of teacher from student model.

  abstract={With successful applications of deep feature learning algorithms, spoken language identification (LID) on long utterances obtains satisfactory performance. However, the performance on short utterances is drastically degraded even when the LID system is trained using short utterances. The main reason is due to the large variation of the representation on short utterances which results in high model confusion. To narrow the performance gap between long, and short utterances, we proposed a teacher-student representation learning framework based on a knowledge distillation method to improve LID performance on short utterances. In the proposed framework, in addition to training the student model on short utterances with their true labels, the internal representation from the output of a hidden layer of the student model is supervised with the representation corresponding to their longer utterances. By reducing the distance of internal representations between short, and long utterances, the student model can explore robust discriminative representations for short utterances, which is expected to reduce model confusion. We conducted experiments on our in-house LID dataset, and NIST LRE07 dataset, and showed the effectiveness of the proposed methods for short utterance LID tasks.},

  abstract={Many enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 (Internet of Things “IoT”, Cloud systems, Big Data Analytics) contribute to the creation of what is the Digital Twin or virtual twin of a physical process, that is a mathematical model capable of describing the process, product or service in a precise way in order to carry out analyses and apply strategies. Digital Twin models integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and analytics software with the data collected from the production plants to create digital simulation models that update when the parameters of the production processes or the working conditions change. This is a self-learning mechanism, which makes use of data collected from various sources (sensors that transmit operating conditions; experts, such as engineers with deep knowledge of the industrial domain; other similar machines or fleets of similar machines) and integrates also historical data relating to the past use of the machine. Starting from the virtual twin vision, simulation plays a key role within the Industry 4.0 transformation. Creating a virtual prototype has become necessary and strategic to raise the safety levels of the operators engaged in the maintenance phases, but above all the integration of the digital model with the IoT has become particularly effective, as the advent of software platforms offers the possibility of integrating real-time data with all the digital information that a company owns on a given process, ensuring the realization of the Digital Twin. In this context, this work aims at developing optimized solutions for application in a beverage pasteurization system using the Digital Twin approach, capable of creating a virtual modelling of the process and preventing high-risk events for operators.},

  abstract={In the era of Industry 4.0, Digital Twins (DTs) pave the way for the creation of the Cognitive Factory. By virtualizing and twinning information stemming from the real and the digital world, it is now possible to connect all parts of the production process by having virtual copies of physical elements interacting with each other in the digital and physical realms. However, this alone does not imply cognition. Cognition requires modelling not only the physical characteristics but also the behavior of production elements and processes. The latter can be founded upon data-driven models produced via Data Analytics and Machine Learning techniques, giving rise to the so-called Cognitive (Digital) Twin. To further enable the Cognitive Factory, a novel concept, dubbed as Enhanced Cognitive Twin (ECT), is proposed in this paper as a way to introduce advanced cognitive capabilities to the DT artefact that enable supporting decisions, with the end goal to enable DTs to react to inner or outer stimuli. The Enhanced Cognitive Twin can be deployed at different hierarchical levels of the production process, i.e., at sensor-, machine-, process-, employee- or even factory-level, aggregated to allow both horizontal and vertical interplay. The ECT notion is proposed in the context of process industries, where cognition is particularly important due to the continuous, non-linear, and varied nature of the respective production processes.},

  abstract={The so-called fourth industrial revolution has brought different technologies to aid in the launching of new products, automation of manufacturing process and designing of intelligent manufacturing systems to monitor and control activities inside the factories. One recurrent challenge of the industrial sector is to evaluate multiple scenarios to make decisions at different levels of the business model. Innovative technologies and tools are used to provide solutions to existing gaps in current manufacturing systems. The evaluation of scenarios is used to manage risks, costs, prepare for upcoming work and forecast demand. Thus, the use of Digital Twin (DT) has proven its value covering the simulation and creation of virtual environments without the physical investment needed. With emergent technologies comes to a great responsibility for institutes to prepare undergraduate students in the development of novel skills, thus, technologies should be adapted and included into the teaching-learning process to aid the adoption from educational to the industrial sector. In this work, it is shown how the adoption of DT has been used to teach industrial concepts such as the automation pyramid, the programming of programmable logic controllers PLC and the exchange of information through industrial networks along with the concepts that constitute digital twins, such as digital master, digital shadow and modelling through system dynamics. Besides, the general vision of how digitalization is understood aligned to the vision of education 4.0 and applied to teach a tool to reduce the time for decision making into the industrial sector.},

  abstract={As one of the key technologies for realizing a fully digitalized world, the Internet of Things (IoT) requires ubiquitous connections across both land and sea. However, due to lack of infrastructure such as optical fibers and base stations, maritime communications inevitably face a highly complex and heterogeneous environment, which greatly challenges the connection reliability and traffic steering efficiency for future service-oriented maritime IoT. With the recent burgeoning application of artificial intelligence (AI) in many fields, an AI-empowered autonomous network for maritime IoT is envisioned as a promising solution. However, AI typically involves training/learning processes, which require realistic data/environment in order to obtain valuable outcomes. To this end, this article proposes the parallel network, which can be regarded as the "digital twin" of the real network and is responsible for realizing four key functionalities: self-learning and optimizing, state inference and network cognition, event prediction and anomaly detection, and knowledge database and snapshots. We then explain how various AI methods can facilitate the operation of the parallel- network-driven maritime network. A case study is provided to demonstrate the idea. Research directions are also outlined for further studies.},

  abstract={In many Human Robot Interaction scenarios, social robots are expected to communicate with human naturally. Especially, the skill of predicting human internal state is a field of great interest in many applications, including video surveillance, behavior analysis, human robot interaction, life-logging. While accurately predicting these technologies (e.g. emotion, confident for talking a topic) could have benefits for many fields, generic machine learning systems still yield low performance in some situation. We hypothesize that these sophisticated models suffer from individual differences of human's personality. Therefore, we proposed a multi characteristic model architecture which combines the personalized machine learning models and utilize each model's prediction score in the inference. This architecture formed with reference to ensemble machine learning architecture. In this research, we focus on a similarity between new user and trained user model by using the idea of applicability domain of machine learning models. In the empirical result, we confirmed that data distribution (one way of checking applicability domain) of each user model correspond to the performance of models and we estimated confidence during communication as a human internal state.},

  abstract={In recent years, deep learning has spread rapidly, and deeper, larger models have been proposed. However, the calculation cost becomes enormous as the size of the models becomes larger. Various techniques for compressing the size of the models have been proposed to improve performance while reducing computational costs. One of the methods to compress the size of the models is knowledge distillation (KD). Knowledge distillation is a technique for transferring knowledge of deep or ensemble models with many parameters (teacher model) to smaller shallow models (student model). Since the purpose of knowledge distillation is to increase the similarity between the teacher model and the student model, we propose to introduce the concept of metric learning into knowledge distillation to make the student model closer to the teacher model using pairs or triplets of the training samples. In metric learning, the researchers are developing the methods to build a model that can increase the similarity of outputs for similar samples. Metric learning aims at reducing the distance between similar and increasing the distance between dissimilar. The functionality of the metric learning to reduce the differences between similar outputs can be used for the knowledge distillation to reduce the differences between the outputs of the teacher model and the student model. Since the outputs of the teacher model for different objects are usually different, the student model needs to distinguish them. We think that metric learning can clarify the difference between the different outputs, and the performance of the student model could be improved. We have performed experiments to compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods. The results show that the student model obtained by the proposed method gives higher performance than the conventional knowledge distillation methods.},

  abstract={Currently, the divergence in distributions of design and operational data, and large computational complexity are limiting factors in the adoption of CNNs in real-world applications. For instance, person re-identification systems typically rely on a distributed set of cameras, where each camera has different capture conditions. This can translate to a considerable shift between source (e.g. lab setting) and target (e.g. operational camera) domains. Given the cost of annotating image data captured for fine-tuning in each target domain, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has become a popular approach to adapt CNNs. Moreover, state-of-the-art deep learning models that provide a high level of accuracy often rely on architectures that are too complex for real-time applications. Although several compression and UDA approaches have recently been proposed to overcome these limitations, they do not allow optimizing a CNN to simultaneously address both. In this paper, we propose an unexplored direction - the joint optimization of CNNs to provide a compressed model that is adapted to perform well for a given target domain. In particular, the proposed approach performs unsupervised knowledge distillation (KD) from a complex teacher model to a compact student model, by leveraging both source and target data. It also improves upon existing UDA techniques by progressively teaching the student about domain-invariant features, instead of directly adapting a compact model on target domain data. Our method is compared against state-of-the-art compression and UDA techniques, using two popular classification datasets for UDA - Office31 and ImageClef-DA. In both datasets, results indicate that our method can achieve the highest level of accuracy while requiring a comparable or lower time complexity.},

  abstract={In order to enable changeable production of Industry 4.0 applications, a production system should respond to unpredictable changes quickly and adequately. This requires process planning to be performed based on the real time operating conditions and dynamic changes to be handled with cognitive skills. To meet this demand, we present a process planning approach using digital twins and reinforcement learning to derive near-optimal process plans. The digital twins enable access to real-time information about the production system. They also constitute the environment for training the agent of the reinforcement learning method. The environment works as a virtual plant, containing the attributes of the product and resources, and uses simulation models of the resources to calculate the reward for an action in terms of reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning enables our approach to derive process plans via trial and error. Besides the virtual plant, our approach has a planner, which plays the role of the agent to derive near-optimal plans by trying different actions in the virtual plant, and observes the rewards. We apply the Q-learning algorithm to derive near optimal process plans. The evaluation results show that our approach is able to derive near-optimal process plans for different problem sizes. The evaluation also demonstrated the planner’s ability to identify by itself which action to take in which situation. Consequently, no modeling of the preconditions and effects of the actions is necessary.},

  abstract={Digital twins are regarded as enablers of smart and autonomous manufacturing systems. The digital twin concept essentially refers to a ultra-realistic digital model of a products or system, coupled by a bidirectional automated data exchange, used for simulation, optimization, and control. Although the concept has gained significant attention, its conceptual basis is still weak. We review common definitions and descriptions of digital twins and refine the concept in system theoretic terms. With this sharpened perspective on digital twins, we sketch out three basic problems that need to be solved to turn a digital model into a digital twin. To that end, we call attention to challenges that need to be researched into.},
