  abstract={Digital twins are becoming a business imperative, covering the entire lifecycle of an asset, and forming the foundation for connected products and services. Companies that fail to respond will be left behind. Implementing a dynamic cloud model of a physical thing or system such as wind turbine that relies on live streaming data will help to understand its states, respond to changes, improve operations, and add value to its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as reliability, availability, maintenance cost and associated risks. This paper contributes to build a power prediction digital twin for a wind turbine’s generic model guided by IEC 61400-25, IEC 61400-27-1-2020 (Type 4A) via utilizing the data analytics of Microsof to Azure IoT mechanisms along with decentralized decisions of Machine Learning (ML) in such way utilizing its strengths in physics-based, data-driven modeling and the hybrid analysis approaches. The proposed modeling technique can help the scientific community in building long-term maintenance models for wind farms considering maintenance opportunities and condition prediction, as well as evaluating the machine performance including maintenance costs and production losses.},

  abstract={Many applications involving physical systems, such as system control or fault detection, call for a behavioral, black-box, or digital twin of the real system. By observing input-output pairs, a nonlinear system’s black-box twinning model can be built, thus enabling real-time accurate estimation of the system’s health and status. We propose a modeling approach that can be implemented with little hardware resources and predicts system output with acceptable accuracy for a wide range of applications in the IoT and Industry 4.0 application domains, such as cloud and distributed predictive control, maintenance, fault detection, and model drift avoidance. This approach consists of building a compact numerical model, based on the concept of sum-decomposability, with reduced computational complexity and memory requirements, well suited for microcontroller-based IoT applications. The black-box modeling theory, the sizing process, and the learning method are reported. The outputs of two examples of non-linear systems are replicated in real-time using a pioneer experimental setup built around a microcontroller. According to experimental results, online learning and prediction are performed at 1 kS/s with a prediction error comparable to the resolution of the digitalized input-output data. The reduced size of the obtained model calls for real-time sharing and update with cloud and edge-based simulation ecosystems enabling a near real-time digital twinning of field systems.},

  abstract={The technological advancements in digital twins (DTs) and next-generation networks boost the development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, the increasing concern for data privacy hinders the further development of IIoT. By manipulating its own dataset and training machine learning models locally, federated learning (FL) has been regarded as a promising technology to establish DT models for IIoT. Nevertheless, the vast amount of model parameters, limited computation and communication resources, and the dynamic industrial environments pose great challenges for FL. In this paper, we present a novel FL framework integrating with DTs in the resource-constrained and dynamic IIoT environment. The clustering algorithm is exploited to design an efficient client selection approach. Furthermore, we propose an efficient model aggregation approach to improve the training efficiency. A resource allocation problem is then formulated and solved based on deep reinforcement learning. Numerical results show that the proposed client selection and resource allocation approach reduces the time cost compared with the baseline schemes.},

  pages={7565-7577},
  abstract={Monocular depth estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision. Due to the costly acquisition of depth ground truth, self-supervised methods that leverage adjacent frames to establish a supervision signal have emerged as the most promising paradigms. In this work, we propose two novel ideas to improve self-supervised monocular depth estimation: 1) self-reference distillation and 2) disparity offset refinement. Specifically, we use a parameter-optimized model as the teacher updated as the training epochs to provide additional supervision during the training process. The teacher model has the same structure as the student model, with weights inherited from the historical student model. In addition, a multiview check is introduced to filter out the outliers produced by the teacher model. Furthermore, we leverage the contextual consistency between high-level and low-level features to obtain multiscale disparity offsets, which are used to refine the disparity output incrementally by aligning disparity information at different scales. The experimental results on the KITTI and Make3D datasets show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art competitors.},

  pages={13474-13489},
  abstract={With the boom in advanced intelligent vehicles, the amount of data associated with the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) grows exponentially. Sharing road data among vehicles effectively can greatly improve their driving efficiency and road experience. This, however, is hindered by security concerns, bandwidth limitations, and mobility and communication distance between vehicles. In this article, we propose a citywide data sharing platform among vehicles based on the digital twin. Specifically, we propose a digital twin based vehicular platform on the cloud to facilitate the effective data sharing of vehicles. A digital twin is a digital representation of a vehicle on the cloud that synchronises data with the vehicle in real time. Therefore, data sharing among vehicles can be accomplished by their digital twins on the cloud without any physical limitations. Considering the data privacy of vehicles, a framework that combines federated learning and transfer learning is applied which can realise personalised data sharing among vehicles without disclosing their data privacy. An incentive mechanism based on the game-theoretic approach is devised to combat the mutual distrust between vehicles and encourage their contribution to data sharing. By sewing the above mechanisms, the proposed digital twin enabled data sharing platform can effectively address privacy, bandwidth limitation and incentive issues. Using extensive trace-driven simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system.},

  title={Knowledge-Enhanced Causal Reinforcement Learning Model for Interactive Recommendation}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-14},
  abstract={Owing to its inherently dynamic nature and economical training cost, offline reinforcement learning (RL) is typically employed to implement an interactive recommender system (IRS). A crucial challenge in offline RL-based IRSs is the data sparsity issue, i.e., it is hard to mine user preferences well from the limited number of user-item interactions. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-enhanced causal reinforcement learning model (KCRL) to mitigate data sparsity in IRSs. We make technical extensions to the offline RL framework in terms of the reward function and state representation. Specifically, we first propose a group preference-injected causal user model (GCUM) to learn user satisfaction (i.e., reward) estimation. We introduce beneficial group preference information, namely, the group effect, via causal inference to compensate for incomplete user interests extracted from sparse data. Then, we learn the RL recommendation policy with the reward given by the GCUM. We propose a knowledge-enhanced state encoder (KSE) to generate knowledge-enriched user state representations at each time step, which is assisted by a self-constructed user-item knowledge graph. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the baselines.},

  abstract={Digital twins capable of quality of transmission (QoT) estimation and prediction are powerful tools for efficient design and operation of optical networks. In this paper, we employ machine learning techniques to enhance both the QoT estimation and prediction capabilities of an optical network digital twin. By leveraging a method to infer or refine the unknown lumped loss distributions and amplifier gain spectra for accurate characterization of the current optical network state, the accuracy of estimation and prediction is substantially improved. For QoT prediction, we further develop a novel neural-network architecture for erbium-doped fiber amplifiers that, after factory training on a single device and with fully loaded configurations only, generalizes to partially loaded configurations seen after deployment and to different gain and tilt settings and other physical devices of the same type. We combine refined parameters and a novel method that predicts the difference in per-channel power when individual services are added or removed or multiple services are lost due to a fiber cut. The impact of error amplification due to cascading of individual components’ models is shown to be reduced, yielding predictions that are substantially more accurate than simply cascaded predictions. As the network ages, the digital twin can be updated by retraining while using only information available in the current network state.},

  abstract={In industry, accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is critical in improving system reliability and reducing downtime and accident risk. Numerous data-driven RUL prediction approaches have been proposed and achieved impressive performance in RUL prediction. However, most of them are still faced with the dilemma of limited samples, and most of popular transfer learning and domain adaptive methods adopt single-source domain adaptation (DA), ignoring the domain-shift within source domain and failing to fully utilize the multi-condition data. This article proposes a model-data fusion life prediction method based on digital twin (DT) and multi-source regression adversarial domain adaptation (MRADA) to address the aforementioned issues. For data-driven life prediction model, the model-based DT technology among them offers a significant amount of multi-condition training data. The proposed MRADA fully utilizes the benefits of DT simulation data by using intra-group alignment strategy, inter-group alignment strategy, adversarial learning, and regressor alignment strategy to learn domain-invariant features and supervision from multiple sources. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed fusion life prediction method can successfully address the issue of small samples and improve the accuracy of rolling bearing life prediction results.},

  abstract={Ultra-high Voltage Direct Current system (UHVDC) can realize long distance transmission, and its loss measurement has great significance for loss reduction and fault diagnosis. Currently, loss measurements can be performed by model-driven and data-driven approaches. However, poor operating conditions can lead to system sensing errors, which can significantly reduce the accuracy and speed of measurement. To deal with this problem, we propose a digital twin architecture and constructs a data-driven learning model. The model, DTformer, is embedded in the digital twin architecture. And it has three remarkable processes: encoder-decoder based random feature extraction, loss measurement transfer learning and knowledge distillation. These processes extract parameter information and topology features from the data of UHVDC. The model has good accuracy, response time and resistance to the missing data. The comparison experiment shows that DTformer outperforms popular feature extraction models with an average decrease of 38.80% in RMSE and 42.82% in MAE, and the best R2 value is closest to 1. The analyses of lightweight and missingness show that the DTformer also has significant response time improvement and missing resistance. Finally, we also implement the visualization of digital twin to enable operators to perform monitoring, computation, analysis and management of UHVDC.},

Specifically, we first design a DT-driven industrial mobile crowdsensing architecture to achieve dynamic perception of the complex IIoT environment, among heterogeneous and resource-constrained mobile clients. Second, we develop a novel incentive-based federated learning framework incorporated with a contract-based reputation mechanism and a Stackelberg-based interclient incentive mechanism, to optimize the model accuracy. Third, we devise a knowledge distillation algorithm for the federated learning framework, to address the heterogeneity of nonindependent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. Extensive experiments on both MNIST/FEMNIST and CIFAR10/100 data sets demonstrate the outperformance of our proposed scheme, in terms of model accuracy, incentive fairness, and data compatibility, compared to state-of-the-art studies.},

  abstract={In order to facilitate rapid prototyping and testing in the advanced motorsport industry, we consider the problem of imitating and outperforming professional race car drivers based on demonstrations collected on a high-fidelity Driver-in-the-Loop (DiL) hardware simulator. We formulate a contextual reinforcement learning problem to learn a human-like and stochastic policy with domain-informed choices for states, actions, and reward functions. To leverage very limited training data and build human-like diverse behavior, we fit a probabilistic model to the expert demonstrations called the reference distribution, draw samples out of it, and use them as context for the reinforcement learning agent with context-specific states and rewards. In contrast to the non-human-like stochasticity introduced by Gaussian noise, our method contributes to a more effective exploration, better performance and a policy with human-like variance in evaluation metrics. Compared to previous work using a behavioral cloning agent, which is unable to complete competitive laps robustly, our agent outperforms the professional driver used to collect the demonstrations by around 0.4 seconds per lap on average, which is the first time known to the authors that an autonomous agent has outperformed a top-class professional race driver in a state-of-the-art, high-fidelity simulation. Being robust and sensitive to vehicle setup changes, our agent is able to predict plausible lap time and other performance metrics. Furthermore, unlike traditional lap time calculation methods, our agent indicates not only the gain in performance but also the driveability when faced with modified car balance, facilitating the digital twin of the DiL simulation.},

  year={2023},
  volume={42},
  number={11},
  pages={3269-3282},
  abstract={Semi-supervised learning via teacher-student network can train a model effectively on a few labeled samples. It enables a student model to distill knowledge from the teacher’s predictions of extra unlabeled data. However, such knowledge flow is typically unidirectional, having the accuracy vulnerable to the quality of teacher model. In this paper, we seek to robust 3D reconstruction of stereo endoscopic images by proposing a novel fashion of bidirectional learning between two learners, each of which can play both roles of teacher and student concurrently. Specifically, we introduce two self-supervisions, i.e., Adaptive Cross Supervision (ACS) and Adaptive Parallel Supervision (APS), to learn a dual-branch convolutional neural network. The two branches predict two different disparity probability distributions for the same position, and output their expectations as disparity values. The learned knowledge flows across branches along two directions: a cross direction (disparity guides distribution in ACS) and a parallel direction (disparity guides disparity in APS). Moreover, each branch also learns confidences to dynamically refine its provided supervisions. In ACS, the predicted disparity is softened into a unimodal distribution, and the lower the confidence, the smoother the distribution. In APS, the incorrect predictions are suppressed by lowering the weights of those with low confidence. With the adaptive bidirectional learning, the two branches enjoy well-tuned mutual supervisions, and eventually converge on a consistent and more accurate disparity estimation. The experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate our superior accuracy over other state-of-the-arts with a relative decrease of averaged disparity error by at least 9.76%.},

  pages={51229-51240},
  abstract={Multimodal transfer learning aims to transform pretrained representations of diverse modalities into a common domain space for effective multimodal fusion. However, conventional systems are typically built on the assumption that all modalities exist, and the lack of modalities always leads to poor inference performance. Furthermore, extracting pretrained embeddings for all modalities is computationally inefficient for inference. In this work, to achieve high efficiency-performance multimodal transfer learning, we propose VideoAdviser, a video knowledge distillation method to transfer multimodal knowledge of video-enhanced prompts from a multimodal fundamental model (teacher) to a specific modal fundamental model (student). With an intuition that the best learning performance comes with professional advisers and smart students, we use a CLIP-based teacher model to provide expressive multimodal knowledge supervision signals to a RoBERTa-based student model via optimizing a step-distillation objective loss—first step: the teacher distills multimodal knowledge of video-enhanced prompts from classification logits to a regression logit—second step: the multimodal knowledge is distilled from the regression logit of the teacher to the student. We evaluate our method in two challenging multimodal tasks: video-level sentiment analysis (MOSI and MOSEI datasets) and audio-visual retrieval (VEGAS dataset). The student (requiring only the text modality as input) achieves an MAE score improvement of up to 12.3% for MOSI and MOSEI. Our method further enhances the state-of-the-art method by 3.4% mAP score for VEGAS without additional computations for inference. These results suggest the strengths of our method for achieving high efficiency-performance multimodal transfer learning.},

  abstract={The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is a precision mechatronic system for nanoscale imaging of surfaces. Due to limited instrument access and lack of visualization techniques, understanding its principles can be challenging. Digital twin technology allows the creation of virtual representations of physical systems, which can be particularly useful to address challenges in AFM education. To realistically simulate nanoscale physics, we first developed new efficient algorithms for four virtual scale models, including cantilever mechanics, probe transducers, controller tuning, and contact mechanics. Second, three simulated experiment interactive learning modules are developed for instrument operation, including virtual imaging, system overview, and imaging modalities. In the end, three hardware systems are integrated for an extended reality experience, including a macroscopic AFM scale model, a haptic device for probe-sample interaction force feedback, and an upgraded low-cost educational AFM for nanoscale imaging and instrumentation. This completes the eight total modules for the AFM SMILER: A scale model interactive learning extended reality toolkit. Preliminary studies show the toolkit being helpful for AFM education. In addition to mechatronics and nanotechnology education, techniques developed in this work can be generally applied to computationally efficient realistic digital twin creation.},

  number={},
  pages={3338-3353},
  abstract={Unsupervised person re-identification is a challenging and promising task in computer vision. Nowadays unsupervised person re-identification methods have achieved great progress by training with pseudo labels. However, how to purify feature and label noise is less explicitly studied in the unsupervised manner. To purify the feature, we take into account two types of additional features from different local views to enrich the feature representation. The proposed multi-view features are carefully integrated into our cluster contrast learning to leverage more discriminative cues that the global feature easily ignored and biased. To purify the label noise, we propose to take advantage of the knowledge of teacher model in an offline scheme. Specifically, we first train a teacher model from noisy pseudo labels, and then use the teacher model to guide the learning of our student model. In our setting, the student model could converge fast with the supervision of the teacher model thus reduce the interference of noisy labels as the teacher model greatly suffered. After carefully handling the noise and bias in the feature learning, our purification modules are proven to be very effective for unsupervised person re-identification. Extensive experiments on two popular person re-identification datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Especially, our approach achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy 85.8% @mAP and 94.5% @Rank-1 on the challenging Market-1501 benchmark with ResNet-50 under the fully unsupervised setting.

  abstract={Digital twins (DT) of industrial processes have become increasingly important. They aim to digitally represent the physical world to help evaluate, optimize, and predict physical processes and behaviors. Therefore, DT is a vital tool to improve production automation through digitalization and becomes more sophisticated due to rapidly evolving simulation and modeling capabilities, integration of IoT sensors with DT, and high-capacity cloud/edge computing infrastructure. However, the fidelity and reliability of DT software are essential to represent the physical world. This paper shows an automated and systematic test architecture for DT that correlates DT states with real-time sensor data from a production line in the forging industry. Our evaluation shows that the architecture can significantly accelerate the automatic DT testing process and improve its reliability. A systematic online DT testing method can significantly detect the performance shift and continuously improve the DT’s fidelity. The snapshot creation methodology and testing agent architecture can be an inspiration and can be generally applicable to other industrial processes that use DT to generalize their automated testing.},

  abstract={The U.S. Navy is considering medium voltage DC (MVDC) power systems as opposed to traditional AC power systems in order to accommodate modern shipboard systems: high power sensors, electronic warfare, and weapons systems. A digital twin of an MVDC naval power system is useful so that its operation can be better understood. In this work, a scaled-down demonstration model of a modern MVDC naval power system is studied through a series of experiments showing the operational benefits of the system when implemented with digital twin technologies. Two portable hybrid unified models of the scaled demonstration system were developed with incorporated machine learning techniques to show improved autonomous control. Because the unified models are portable, they may be developed in one tool, but then used with another tool on another platform. In a field setting, for example, a unified model may be simulated alongside an actual Navy ship to better understand its operation and vice versa.},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={Packet loss inferring can enable a transceiver to distinguish between channel impairment and collision for transmission failures, and thus can improve the network performance by exclusively performing rate adaptation or adjusting the medium access parameter. Machine learning methods from literature have shown great potential in producing models that can detect the loss causes over various network trace, however haven't considered accurate data-driven loss inferring on resource-constrained devices that cannot accommodate deep models. In this paper, we propose a novel packet loss inferring framework that can train lightweight models to distinguish between channel losses and collisions by learning the data trace from both simulation and real devices. Specifically, we first train a sophisticated teacher model based on extensive simulation datasets, whose knowledge is then transferred to a small student model that can be deployed on tiny device. The simulation-reality distillation is conducted via personalized trace from each client correspondingly, whose performance bound is analytically guaranteed. We have implemented our method on real testbed and show that the network access performance can be significantly improved, especially for sudden network variations.},

  abstract={In multi-view learning, how to effectively integrate features among multiple views becomes a key challenge. For multi-label tasks, it is extremely important that the relationship between features and labels. This paper proposes a Target Embedding Autoencoder framework based on knowledge distillation (tea-mvml), which explores the correlation between features and labels in Multi-View Multi-Label (MVML) learning. The framework transfers knowledge from a teacher model based on a Target Embedding Autoencoder (TEA) to a small student model through knowledge distillation. The teacher model of tea-mvml learns the relationship between features and labels in the potential space, while the student model has the generalization ability of the teacher model. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that tea-mvml not only reduces the complexity of the model, but also outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-view multi-label classification approaches.},

  abstract={The fourth industrial revolution has had a significant impact on the modern world. The fourth industrial revolution is primarily driven by the intelligent edge systems. Industry 4.0 is the integration of Big Data, Cloud Computing, Advanced Robotics, Internet of Things, Digital twin, and several other new technologies to enhance production processes that result in better products in a shorter amount of time at a cheaper cost. Tracking of machine health, maintenance through prediction, and scheduling of production are the three main issues facing any industrial sector. Smart manufacturing can address the aforementioned issues by using data-driven deep learning techniques. The model to effectively address the aforementioned difficulties is developed using the deep convolutional LSTM encoder-decoder architecture. LSTM auto-encoder, a feed-forward neural network whose input signal is equal to its output signal, can be used to predict the machine's speed. To put it another way, an auto encoder is an individual research algorithm that uses input data without a labeled target dataset to extract features. Some performance metrics, such as RMSE, MAE, MSE, and SMAPE, are revealed by the experimental results.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) enables intelligent services varying with the complex and realtime environment to achieve network benefits, where network function virtualization (NFV) can dynamically provide virtualized network functions (VNFs) for IoT devices. In the NFV-enabled IoT architecture, a service function chain (SFC) consists of an ordered set of VNFs. However, the energy consumption of the VNF migration and SFC reconfiguration is one major issue owing to the dynamic characteristic of the IoT network. In this article, we propose a new paradigm digital twin (DT) to create the virtual twin of physical objects in the IoT network, then, we formalize the problem as a mathematical model, which aims to minimize the energy consumption. To this end, we prove this problem is NP-hard and propose an algorithm bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) based on federated learning to predict the resource requirement. Further more, according to the prediction result, which utilizing the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for decision making of the VNF migration.

  abstract={Traffic classification, which deduces task-relevant traffic types, is required for network management, security, and quality of service (QoS). In recent studies, deep learning has been used to distinguish encrypted traffic without using handcraft features. However, higher-performance deep learning models often come with a significant computational overhead and parameter count. In this article, we present a novel cross-modal fusion model, CMFTC, which achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model DISTILLER, but with only 18% of its parameters and half the floating-point operations (FLOPs). The CMFTC model is designed to carefully capture the relationship between different modalities and employs a lightweight design for efficient computation. Our model achieves better performance by fusing packet, context, and flow-level modalities. Additionally, we propose a pair of homogeneous student and teacher models with similar architectures, and we adjust the distillation algorithm to improve the student model's inference speed without compromising performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the current SOTA on several benchmark datasets, including Ton_IoT, IoT-23, ISCX-Tor-2016, ISCX-VPN-2016, and USTC-TFC, with significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs. Furthermore, our model has a better inference speed on real IoT devices, as demonstrated by our experiments.},

  abstract={The edge of the Internet of Things (IoT), which consists of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), is vulnerable to network intrusion because software and wireless connections are used extensively in the IoT. Designing an efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) model is imperative. However, when creating IDS models with distributed data collected by UAVs, it is necessary to take precautions to protect the data’s security and privacy. Furthermore, most of the IDS models are focused on one-time learning but not on continuous learning. To this end, we propose a federated continuous learning framework with a stacked broad learning system (FCL-SBLS) based on the digital twin network (DTN), which can learn and train the IDS model on new data quickly and continuously. In order to improve the efficiency and quality of the IDS model when training and aggregation, we employ an asynchronous federated learning (FL) architecture, and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based UAV selection scheme assisted by DTN is proposed to help the global IDS model aggregation. The presented algorithm is validated using the CIC-IDS2017 data set, and the simulation results reveal that our algorithm achieves higher efficiency and accuracy than the existing FL scheme.},

  abstract={Maritime industries desire high speed and reliability, low lifespan cost, and environmental impact shipping for transportation. Compared to highly congested land shipments and high-cost air freight, all-electric ship (AES) can reduce the lifespan energy consumption and transport a considerable freight volume at a lower rate. Recently, the medium voltage dc (MVDC) topology, recommended by IEEE standard, pushes the AES to the next stage in considering space and weight constraints with the reduction of bulky transformers and simplified parallel connections. However, device-level modeling of this massive parallel MVDC-based ship-board microgrid (SBM) is challenging to both the state-of-the-art general-purpose compute unit and traditional electromagnetic transient (EMT)-based emulation. With the rapid development of machine learning (ML) algorithm and its dedicated execution unit, accelerated parallel emulation becomes achievable in different levels of this paralleled connected SBM. Applying the ML-aided technique can help to improve the emulation execution efficiency and reduce the consumption of hardware resource on the field-programmable gate arrays. This work proposes a real-time hybrid ML-EMT-based digital twin of the complete SBM at the subsystem-level and equipment-level with validated results from PSCAD/EMTDC, and device-level with validated results from SaberRD.},

  volume={24},

  pages={11157-11170},
  abstract={Point cloud semantic segmentation for railway infrastructures is an essential step towards establishing railway digital twins. Deep learning-based methods have shown great potential in this field compared to traditional methods that rely on hand-crafted features. However, deep learning-based methods for railway point clouds still face typical challenges that need to be addressed. In this regard, we propose a novel learning framework named SALAProNet, which consists of a set of effective and concise modular solutions. The first challenge addressed is the massive data scale of railway point clouds, which makes it difficult to directly process large-scale point clouds due to memory limitations. To solve this problem, we adapt efficient random sampling in the network and propose the Self-Attentive Aggregation (SAA) module based on an attention mechanism to greatly expand the receptive field, which covers the unsampled points and successfully retains information in a high-dimensional feature space. The second challenge is fine-grained segmentation, where we propose the Local Geometry Embedding (LGE) module to embed local geometry. With the help of context information provided by SAA, the network can perform fine-grained segmentation for railway infrastructures. The third challenge is the insufficient generalization ability of the network, where we propose a Prototype Guided Regularization (PGR) method to guide the network to segment the point cloud among railways with different construction standards. This method enhances the network’s interpretability and improves its generalization ability. We have validated our proposed framework through experiments on different datasets, and it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract={Satellite orbit prediction has important applications in the field of space situation awareness, such as space collision warning and observation scheduling. The expansion of space information network challenges the low delay, high-accuracy transmission and real-time response of satellite orbit prediction tasks. The traditional orbit prediction process is affected by the measurement error, the estimation error, the unmodeled orbit perturbation and other factors, resulting in low accuracy orbit prediction results. In order to meet the requirements of high accuracy requirements, we built a satellite digital twin system based on the Docker container to predict, optimize and control the satellite orbit status in low consumption. The proposed digital twin system uses the container technology to build each module, which makes the updating of the orbit prediction model more convenient. In addition, in the designed digital twin system, we present an orbit error prediction model based on machine learning. Compared with the traditional physical dynamic model, the proposed machine learning model can effectively correct the error value of orbit prediction and improve the accuracy of orbit prediction. Finally, the validity of the corresponding model is verified in the simulation environment.},

  abstract={Widespread applications based on the Internet of Things (IoT) are driving the adoption of digital twins (DTs) to optimize operations and increase efficiency. However, the development of DT-empowered IoT systems has put forward a series of new requirements for the in-depth mining of comprehensive data. The first is how to ensure that the fusion results of data from a large number of connected physical and virtual entities scattered in heterogeneous networks are always better than data from the physical or virtual world alone. The second is how to effectively coordinate the interaction between physical entities and virtual entities to optimize the operation and management of IoT services. This article proposes a novel DT architecture to build various feature-rich virtual entities, and introduces a new concept of DT data liquidity to orchestrate physical-to-physical, physical-to-virtual, and virtual-to-virtual interactions of intelligent IoT functions. A federated learning method based on a two-phase optimization scheme is also developed to optimize the data liquidity of the DT system through orchestrated cloud-edge-device DT collaboration to provide high fault tolerance and reliability IoT services. Performance evaluation results on the CIRFAR10-LT benchmark and two real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence, accuracy and generalization ability.},

To address these challenges, we propose a DT-empowered MEC architecture that supports Mobile Users (MUs) offloading dependency-aware tasks, while considering service caching and edge collaboration. The objective is to jointly optimize computation offloading and resource allocation to minimize the system’s energy consumption.

  abstract={Digital Twin is the seamless data integration between a physical and virtual machine in either direction. Emotion recognition in healthcare is becoming increasingly important due to recent developments in Machine Learning methods. However, it may face technical problems such as limited datasets, occlusion and lighting issues, identifying key features, incorrect emotion classification, high implementation costs, head posture, and a person’s cultural background. This paper proposes a novel approach based on facial expression and body movement recognition for emotion recognition. It uses three devices (Kinect 1, Kinect 2, and RGB HD camera) to construct a new bi-modal database containing 17 participants’ performances of six emotional states. Two mono-modal classifiers have been developed to obtain sufficient state information based on facial expression and body motion analysis. The system’s performance is assessed using three algorithms: Bagged Trees,  $k$ -Nearest Neighbors ( $k$ -NN), and Support Vector Machine (Linear and Cubic). The acquired findings demonstrate the excellent performance of the suggested method and the effectiveness of the proposed features, particularly the combination of 3D distance and 3D angle, in characterising and identifying emotions. Results obtained using Kinect 2 marginally surpass those with Kinect 1. Comparing 2D RGB and RGB-D data reveals that the depth information significantly raises the recognition rate. RGB-D features can be used to represent emotions, but there are discrepancies between RGB and RG-D data.},

  year={2023},
  volume={61},
  number={},
  pages={1-15},
  abstract={Recently, remote sensing image (RSI) semantic segmentation technology has advanced greatly, with the fully supervised process achieving particularly strong performance. However, the technology depends heavily on dataset labels, leading to high annotation costs. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel efficient end-to-end hybrid consistency regularization algorithm (EI-HCR) for the semisupervised semantic segmentation of RSI, wherein only a few labeled images and a large number of unlabeled images are effectively used. First, we devise data perturbation (DP) consistency regularization (CR), which includes a data mix-up method to combine unlabeled and labeled images. Then, we employ teacher and student networks to conduct model perturbation (MP) CR. Both segmentation results are regarded as pseudo-labels for each other. In the end, the semisupervised loss is composed of DP and MP consistency loss and supervises network training along with the fully supervised loss. More importantly, we first combine the characteristics of knowledge distillation to make the student network more lightweight, efficiently reducing the model inference time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EI-HCR on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Massachusetts Buildings datasets. With only 5% of the labeled images, EI-HCR can achieve the same accuracy as the fully supervised training with 50% of the labeled images, and the number of student model parameters is only 9.64 M, indicating the method’s great advantages over other algorithms.},

  abstract={A detailed methodology to develop a digital twin has many useful applications in the era of technology 4.0. This study provides a framework to develop a digital twin for vibration prediction and fatigue life prognosis of a vertical oil well drillstring. The nature and the severity of the down-hole vibrations are identified and estimated based on the vibrational and operational parameter measurements made at the surface level. Because of the difficulty in accessing full-scale industrial drilling data, a reduced-scale drillstring was constructed that could exhibit bit bounce, stick-slip and whirl. A bond graph simulation model was tuned to match the apparatus, and then used to generate synthetic training data. The trained machine learning algorithm can classify the incoming surface monitoring data from the physical twin into different types and severities of vibration states which are not otherwise observable. Moreover, the classified vibration condition is used to re-configure the bond graph model with appropriate complexity to generate a loading history for fatigue life prognosis. The fatigue life estimation uses a novel combination of a low-complexity model of the entire drillstring and a high fidelity finite element model of components where stress concentrations are most severe. The digital twin detected the vibration type and its severity and estimated the remaining fatigue life of the physical system using only measurements of the motor current, rig floor axial vibration, and rotary speed.},

  abstract={We present a novel emulation system for creating high-fidelity digital twins of IT infrastructures. The digital twins replicate key functionality of the corresponding infrastructures and allow to play out security scenarios in a safe environment. We show that this capability can be used to automate the process of finding effective security policies for a target infrastructure. In our approach, a digital twin of the target infrastructure is used to run security scenarios and collect data. The collected data is then used to instantiate simulations of Markov decision processes and learn effective policies through reinforcement learning, whose performances are validated in the digital twin. This closed-loop learning process executes iteratively and provides continuously evolving and improving security policies. We apply our approach to an intrusion response scenario. Our results show that the digital twin provides the necessary evaluative feedback to learn near-optimal intrusion response policies.},

Our method for finding effective control policies includes a simulator and a control module. The simulator is instantiated with traces from a testbed, and the control module trains a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to efficiently learn effective control policies on the simulator.

  volume={31},

  pages={2461-2475},
  abstract={Most of the voice spoofing detection methods are designed for specific kinds of spoofing attacks, synthetic or replay. In practice, however, there is no prior information about these two kinds of spoofing attacks. To this end, this paper proposes a generalized voice spoofing detection method based on integral knowledge amalgamation to detect jointly synthetic attacks and replay attacks. Two amalgamation mechanisms, feature amalgamation and structure amalgamation, are designed from different perspectives, so that the model can generalize better and run fast. Specifically, the feature amalgamation transfers the high-level sematic knowledge from two teacher models to the compact model. The structure amalgamation employs the adversarial learning to ensure the global structure consistency of two teacher models and a student model. In addition, the feature matching loss is introduced to capture the distinctive features of synthetic attacks and replay attacks. We conduct extensive experiments on logical access (LA) scenario and physical access (PA) scenario of ASVspoof 2019 dataset to verify the validity of the proposed method. The experimental results show that compared with the most advanced generalized voice spoofing detection methods, the proposed method achieves a comparable or even better performance. In particular, our method gains the state-of-the-art detection capability on LA scenario. Moreover, our method achieves similar or even outstanding detectability when compared with specialized anti-spoofing methods.},

  abstract={In the highly competitive manufacturing industry, optimizing the cycle time of industrial robots plays a crucial role in enhancing production efficiency and maximizing profitability. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and optimization approach for reducing the cycle time of industrial robots specifically used for loading molding machines. The study begins by investigating the key factors that affect the cycle time, including robot movement, tool selection, part handling, and machine setup. Through in-depth analysis and empirical data collection, the paper identifies the critical bottlenecks and inefficiencies that contribute to prolonged cycle times. Based on the identified issues, a systematic optimization approach is proposed to streamline the robot loading process. This approach encompasses various strategies, such as optimizing robot trajectories, implementing intelligent part recognition systems, improving gripper designs, and leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms for real-time decision- making. The paper explores the benefits and implementation challenges associated with each strategy. Furthermore, the study discusses the integration of simulation models and digital twin technologies to predict and optimize the cycle time in a virtual environment. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization approach, experimental evaluations are conducted using a real-world industrial setup same as the one implemented in the manufacturing. The results demonstrate significant cycle time reductions while maintaining high product quality and ensuring worker safety.},

  abstract={The training of 3D medical image segmentation model requires a large amount of labeled data, but the availability of labeled data is difficult, and the scarcity of labeled data makes the prediction quality of unlabeled data cannot be effectively guaranteed. To solve the above problems, the 3D medical image segmentation model UT-MT proposed in this paper combines ViT and CNN, and consists of a student model and a teacher model, and the student model learns the teacher model by minimizing the segmentation loss and consistency loss. By combining the feature learning advantages of CNN and ViT, this method enables the model to enhance the learning ability of taking into account both local and global aspects in feature extraction, and further improves the model accuracy and performance. The evaluation was performed on a public left atrial benchmark dataset, and the results at 10% of the labeled images show that the proposed method improves the Dice coefficient by 6.69% over the fully supervised method and has better segmentation of the boundaries, while our method outperforms five advanced semi-supervised segmentation methods.},

  abstract={The bridge of job scheduling and production equipment maintenance is usually the main joint scheduling task of a production system. However, the predicament of data acquisition in real systems leads to the difficulty of verifying the effectiveness of scheduling algorithms. In order to make joint scheduling work easier to implement in real production systems, this paper presents a joint scheduling framework for production systems based on digital twin and reinforcement learning. Firstly, the virtual mapping of physical production system, namely digital twin system, is established by using AnyLogic software and multi-agent modeling technology. Then, a joint scheduling agent is trained by Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm and the virtual data generated by the twinning system. And the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed framework in production systems with uncertainties, and it has higher production efficiency and lower machine failure frequency compared with a scheduling scheme based on common-used heuristic rules.},

  abstract={In the digital age, the digital twin eliminates physical barriers and risks, facilitating seamless activities in both real and virtual worlds. In the context of additive manufacturing, testing 3D printers can be resource-intensive and prone to printing issues. This research introduces a digital twin-based system that employs the innovative ensemble 3D-AmplifAI algorithm for fault monitoring in 3D printers. The system continuously monitors real-time temperature values and detects faults to prevent potential damage to the printer. Through an ensemble method, the 3D-AmplifAI algorithm combines multiple machine learning models to enhance fault detection in 3D printers. The digital twin environment, developed using Unity, serves as the bridge connecting the physical printer to the virtual world. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art algorithms, including Ridge Regression, XGBoost, InceptionTime, Time Series Transformer (TST), Rocket Ridge, Logistic Regression, Rocket XGBoost, ResNet, and Rocket Ridge Regression, demonstrate the superior performance of the 3D-AmplifAI algorithm in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.},

  abstract={The structural digital twin is a virtual representation of physical entities that accurately predicts the evolution of structural damage through multidisciplinary and multi-level probabilistic simulations. It provides crucial support for prognostic and health management. Flight parameters are important input data for airframe digital twin to support aerodynamic and structural simulations. However, many small aircraft or UAVs often suffer from insufficient sampling rates of flight parameters due to cost limitation or premature service. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based flight data upsampling method that effvbectively enhances the resolution of flight data. The method constructs an upsampling model using a one-dimensional super-resolution convolutional residual network, defines multiple loss functions associated with the flight data, and uses a highly sampled test aircraft dataset for training. The proposed method is validated using real UAV flight test data and several criteria, achieving good results with different upsampling factors. This approach is expected to facilitate the construction of structural digital twins in the future.},

  abstract={Multi-tier computing (MC) utilizes computing resources from the cloud, fog, edge, and end layers to promote intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Federated learning (FL) in MC offers a prospective distributed and privacy-preserving framework to deploy deep learning applications in different layers. Due to time-varying network topologies, wireless channel states, and computational workloads, MC faces a dynamic and uncertain environment, which poses additional challenges to FL task processing. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive training and aggregation federated learning (ATAFL) framework. Specifically, local model training can be performed at end devices, edge nodes, and fog nodes. The global aggregator can choose from the edge, fog, and cloud layers. A joint optimization problem of training, aggregation node selection, and resource allocation is further formulated to minimize system latency and energy consumption. Moreover, digital twin and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques are integrated into the MC network to design optimal node selection and resource allocation strategies based on captured state information of the MC system. We implement a prototype, and experimental results show that our proposed DRL-based algorithm reduces system latency and energy consumption compared with the benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract={This article proposes a digital twin (DT)-based diagnosis and fault-tolerant control for T-type three-level rectifiers. To develop the DT, a dense deep neural network (DNN) machine learning approach is used. The DT is trained offline using a set of experimental data and updated online to get the maximum possible accuracy. Then, the DT is used for the diagnosis and tolerance of open-switch faults (OSFs) and faults related to voltage and current sensors or for sensorless control. The OSF detection and localization algorithm is implemented based on the dynamic response difference between the physical system and its DT. First, the OSF is detected and localized based on the grid current dynamics, where each switch fault generates a specific pattern in the current dynamics. OSF is tolerated by changing the switching function based on the location of the fault. Second, the voltage and current sensor fault is detected when the DT provides a specific amplitude of currents while the physical sensors do not provide a correct measurement. This case is tolerated by feeding back the grid currents or voltages from the DT as an alternative to the physical sensors. The proposed technique has low overhead, enhances the reliability of the power converter, and is applicable for sensorless mode of control. Experimental investigations are conducted to validate the proposed concept.},

  year={2023},
  volume={32},

  pages={882-895},
  abstract={Research on speech enhancement algorithms in the airborne environment is of great significance to the security of airborne systems. Recently, the research focus of speech enhancement has turned from conventional unsupervised algorithms, like the log minimum mean square error estimator (log-MMSE), to the state-of-the-art masking-based long short-term memory (LSTM) method. However, each method has its characteristics and limitations, so they cannot always handle noise well. Besides, the requirements of clean speech and noise data for training a supervised speech enhancement model are difficult to satisfy in the real-world airborne environment. Therefore, in this work, to fully utilize the advantages of those two different methods without any data restrictions, we propose a novel adaptive gain mask (AGM) based teacher-student training approach for speech enhancement. In our method, the AGM, as a robust learning target for the student model, is devised by incorporating the estimated ideal ratio mask from the teacher model into the procedure of the log-MMSE approach. To get an appropriate tradeoff between the two methods, we adaptively update the AGM using a recursive weighting coefficient. Experiments on the real airborne data show that the proposed AGM-based method outperforms other baselines in terms of all essential objective metrics evaluated in this paper.},

  abstract={Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) are computer-based learning systems that use intelligent technologies to provide adaptive learning paths and contents to learners by considering their characteristics and needs. The learner model, which is a representation of different learner’s characteristics, plays a key role in this adaptation. Research on educational psychology showed that emotion and learning have a hidden mutual relationship. If a learning process involves both cognitive and affective dimensions, then learning is like to be more usable, socially appropriate, acceptable and memorable, ultimately leading to significant improvement in the learner’s performance and the learning experience. However, traditional ITS ignore emotional aspects in learner modelling mostly; instead, they focus on learners’ cognition and motivation to maximise the knowledge to be achieved. The characteristics related to cognition are not well defined and primarily sparse when modelling a learner profile tailored to the learning domains. This study attempts to investigate the most common and relevant personal traits involved in the learning process based on the domains of learning. It also explores the most adopted techniques to identify such traits from log files of learners’ interactions with ITS without using physical and physiological sensors (i.e., camera, EEG) to model characteristics learner profiles for ITS aiming to improve its adaptiveness and leverage personalised learning.},

Deep neural network (DNN) learning algorithms, pretrained on the large database can empower real-time object detection as well as fully autonomous, safe robotic navigation in unstructured environments while avoiding the potential obstacle. However, the development and deployment of the robots, inspection planning and operation procedures are still tedious and segmented with tremendous manual intervention during environmental inspection and anomaly monitoring. The proposed digital twin approach is able to provide a virtual representation model of the target environment either from a build-design or from 3D scanning of the real-world physical assets at high resolution in the Unity simulation environment, a transverse drone robot model and test its Robotics Operating System(ROS) autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance software stack, and the hardware-in-the-loop test can thus be conducted for the flight control algorithm effectiveness and real-time object detection performance evaluation. The preliminary result shows that VGG16-UNet deep learning algorithm was able to use only a small amount of guidance and time from experienced inspection pilots to successfully identify the critical elements and defects and real-time navigate around the unstructured environment.

  year={2023},

  number={},
  pages={1-14},
  abstract={Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in remote sensing and has been predominantly performed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the past decade. Recently, transformers with self-attention mechanisms have demonstrated superior performance compared with CNNs. However, due to the locality of CNN and the high computational complexity and massive data resource requirements of transformer, neither of them can be well applied in resource-constrained practical remote sensing scenarios. Motivated by the limitations of using either CNNs or transformers alone in the task of semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, a novel cross-model knowledge distillation (KD) framework, named distilling segmenters from CNNs and transformers (DSCTs), is proposed in this article to harness the complementary advantages of both the models. The framework uses a channel-weighted attention-guided feature distillation (CAFD) module to condense the feature from the teacher model and enhance the student model’s focus on the teacher-focused regions. In addition, a target–nontarget KD (TNKD) module is proposed that decouples logit distillation into target and nontarget KD to guide the student model in learning the underlying representations and decision boundaries from the teacher model. By learning the complementary knowledge from the teacher, our proposed DSCT framework improves the student’s segmentation performance without adding trainable parameters. Experiments on four available remote sensing datasets (ISPRS Potsdam, Vaihingen, GID, and LoveDA) indicate that the proposed DSCT outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods and demonstrates its effectiveness and robustness.},

  abstract={As the proliferation of sophisticated task models in 5G empowered digital twin, it yields significant demands on fast and accurate model training over resource-limited wireless networks. It is vital to investigate how to accelerate the training process based on the salient features of practical systems, including heterogeneous data distributions and system resources both across devices and over time. To study the non-trivial coupling between participating device selection and their appropriate training parameters, we first characterize the dependency of convergence performance bound on system parameters, i.e., statistical structure of local data, mini-batch size and gradient quantization level. Based on the theoretical analysis, a training efficiency optimization problem is formulated subject to heterogeneous communication and computation capabilities among devices. To realize online control of training parameters, we propose an adaptive batch-size assisted device scheduling strategy, which prioritizes the selection of devices that offer good data utility and dynamically adjust their mini-batch sizes and gradient quantization levels adapting to network conditions. Simulation results demonstrate our proposed strategy can effectively speed up the training process as compared with benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract={Ultra-high voltage direct current (UHVDC) transmission systems have multiple inputs and multiple outputs, nonlinearity and strong coupling, making it challenging to accurately measure component and system losses using traditional methods based on system mechanisms and simplified modeling of parameters. In this paper, a digital twin modeling method based on deep learning networks is proposed to solve the above problem. The proposed method extracts sequence features of loss data using LSTM based on improved Res-LSTM network modeling, fuses all features effectively by combining residual structure with convolution kernel, and establishes a digital twin model of the UHVDC transmission system to realize strong coupling and nonlinear mapping from multiple inputs to multiple outputs. The experimental results show that the Res-LSTM model is 37.57% lower than the LSTM model for MSE in the total loss calculation mode, and 11.8% lower than the LSTM model for MSE in the sub-loss sequence calculation mode. It is verified that the Res-LSTM model has high accuracy in constructing the digital twin model to measure the total loss of the UHVDC transmission system. The proposed digital twin model can help analyze and provide some useful suggestions for loss reduction of the UHVDC transmission system.},

  abstract={In the era of big data, the field of deep learning is developing rapidly. Deep learning model algorithms and a large amount of data make deep learning an effective tool to solve practical problems. However, in the current centralized deep learning model of a large number of client-server models, when we upload our data for training on the server side, there is a risk of leaking privacy. Federated Learning is a type of distributed machine learning that allows multiple institutions or individuals to learn collaboratively without exchanging data. Users only upload their model parameters, and the server aggregates the model parameters of each user into a global model and returns it to the client, and the client updates its local model according to the global model to achieve the global optimal solution, avoiding leakage of private data. However, attackers can still restore user data by obtaining uploaded model parameters from users, which leads to the fact that only transmitting model parameters cannot protect user privacy. Therefore, the issue of privacy protection has become the focus of federated learning. In this paper, the CSP (conjugate search problem) fully homomorphic encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the user model parameters. The CSP encrypt algorithm will not cause the loss of model performance, and at the same time has the characteristics of fast encryption speed, which is very suitable for application in the field of machine learning.},

  pages={1-11},
  abstract={In the traditional marine equipment construction process, the material transportation vehicle scheduling method dominated by manual experience has shown great limitations, which is inefficient, costly, wasteful of human resources, and unable to cope with complex and changing scheduling scenarios. The existing scheduling system cannot realize the information interaction and collaborative integration between the physical world and the virtual world, while the digital twin (DT) technology can effectively solve the problem of real-time information interaction and the reinforcement learning (RL) method can cope with dynamic scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposed a DT-driven RL method to solve the marine equipment vehicle scheduling problem. Given the dynamic nature of transportation tasks, the diversity of transported goods, and the optimization characteristics of transportation requirements, a framework for scheduling transportation vehicle operations based on DT is constructed, and a RL-based vehicle scheduling method in a dynamic task environment is proposed. A Markov decision process (MDP) model of the vehicle scheduling process is established to realize one-to-one mapping between information and physical elements. An improved RL method based on Q-learning is proposed to solve the MDP model, and the value function approximation and convergence enhancement methods are applied to optimize the solving process. Finally, a case study is used for example verification to prove the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper. Note to Practitioners—The motivation of this paper is to optimize material transportation vehicle scheduling in dynamic task environments and to improve logistics transportation efficiency. Therefore, a DT-based vehicle scheduling method for marine equipment is proposed. Firstly, a framework of vehicle scheduling based on DT is designed to establish a MDP model of the vehicle scheduling process, and the dynamic task characteristics are described by mathematical methods in the design of the elements of the model. A RL-based vehicle scheduling method is proposed. The value function approximation method and the convergence enhancement method of the algorithm are investigated for the characteristics of continuous dynamic action features leading to huge state space and non-convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm performance is verified and analyzed through data validation of actual cases.},

  year={2023},
  volume={61},
  number={10},
  pages={100-106},
  abstract={Slicing-enabled communication networks refer to a network architecture that enables the definition of multiple virtual networks or “slices” over a shared physical network. Each slice operates independently with its own dedicated resources, configuration, and management. However, this poses a major challenge in guaranteeing optimal resource allocation among those slices while preserving the obligatory Quality of Service (QoS) levels for each one. This study presents a federated learning-driven digital twin (DT) framework named FED-DT for creating a digital replica of the physical slicing-supported network to mimic its complicated infrastructure and forecast the network's dynamic performance. In FED-DT, the DT of network slicing is designated as non-Euclidean graph representations. A novel lightweight Graph Lineformer Network (GLN) is introduced to collaboratively learn and estimate QoS metrics from the topological structures of the underlying network slices. The FED-DT is empowered with an intelligent self-supervision method to improve generalizability on a large network, while Gaussian Differential Privacy (DP) is applied to guarantee the preservation of model privacy during training. Proof-of-concept simulations on different network topologies demonstrate the effectiveness of FED-DT in fulfilling rigid QoS requirements and achieving ideal performance.},

  abstract={Cloud computing enables Network Function Virtualization to dynamically provide and deploy network functions (NFs) to meet business-specific requirements. This approach streamlines NFs’ lifecycle management and lowers the cost of Operation Administration and Maintenance. However, these advantages cause Service Function Chain (SFC) failure to grow in both scope and dimensionality, making it difficult to establish a model to locate the failure effectively. In this paper, we propose a complete analysis scheme DTFL (Digital Twin (DT) based for SFC failure localization (FL)) through the following two steps: one is classifying and locating failures, and the other is conducting root cause analysis. We propose transGNN based on the Graph Neural Network and improved graph search model to achieve the classification and location for SFC failures. On this basis, the FNSG-RCA algorithm (failure based graph model) is proposed to analyze failures. We build a prototype based on the cloud platform and experimental results show that this scheme can achieve an accuracy rate of over 98% in fine-grained classification of 49 failure types. In addition, DTFL delivers desirable performance in RCA, approximately 13% more accurate than SOTA, the state-of-the-art approach. DTFL improves both RCA accuracy and model deployment efficiency compared with the non-DT approaches.},

  abstract={Multi-access edge computing (MEC) represents an emerging solution to improve the performance of mobile networks by bringing computing resources closer to the edge of the network. However, MEC requires the implementation of virtualization and can be deployed using different hardware platforms, including COTS devices. In this highly heterogeneous scenario, the digital twin (DT), assisted by proper AI/ML solutions, is envisioned to play a crucial role in automated network management, operating as an intermediate and collaborative layer enabling the orchestration layer to better understand network behavior before making changes to the physical network. In this paper, we aim to develop a DT model that captures the behavior of a MEC node supporting services with varying workloads. In pursuit of this objective, we adopt a data-driven methodology that effectively learn a model predicting three critical key performance indicators (KPIs): throughput, computational load, and power consumption. To demonstrate the viability and potential of such approach, a measurement campaign is conducted on MEC nodes deployed with different virtualization environments (bare metal, virtual machine, and containerized), and the results are used to build the DT of each node. Furthermore, machine learning models, including k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), and polynomial fitting (PF), are used to understand the amount of actual measurements required to achieve a suitably low KPI prediction error. The results of this study provide a basis for further research in the field of MEC DT models and carbon footprint-aware orchestration.},

  abstract={The telecommunications sector is devoting an initial interest in the representation of complex networks as Digital Twins. The concept of a Digital Twin Network (DTN) is a research topic, but it promises to be an important step for harmonizing different models of the Edge-Cloud Continuum. The DTN software framework aims at helping network operations by providing updated and complete views on the network or parts of it, and it also introduces the possibility to simulate the network behavior or to learn from network events history (Machine Learning) without jeopardizing the actual operations of resources. In addition, thanks to the representation capabilities of the DT, its usage in the network promises to support different stakeholders’ views on their virtualized and physical infrastructure. This work tries to consolidate a DTN data model representing the elements of the Edge-Cloud Continuum by providing a layered (horizontal) and segmented (vertical) view of the infrastructure to all the involved stakeholders. The DTN model is an ontology where the linked classes represent properties and relations of networked components. This work aims to design a flexible and extensible ontology that describes the Edge-Cloud continuum usable in the telecommunications as well in the Cloud (IT and web) industries creating a bridge between the two.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-15},
  abstract={As the cornerstone of human-behavior analysis in video understanding, temporal action proposal generation aims to predict the starting and ending time of human action instances in untrimmed videos. Although large achievements in temporal action proposal generation have been achieved, most previous studies ignore the variability of action frequency in raw videos, leading to unsatisfying performances on high-action-frequency videos. In fact, there exists two main issues which should be well addressed: data imbalance between high and low action-frequency videos, and inferior detection of short actions in high-action-frequency videos. To address the above issues, we propose an effective framework by adapting to the variability of action frequency, namely Action Frequency Adaptive Network (AFAN), which can be flexibly built upon any temporal action proposal generation method. AFAN consists of two modules: Learning From Experts (LFE) and Fine-Grained Processing (FGP). The LFE first trains a series of action proposal generators on different subsets of imbalanced data as experts and then teaches a unified student model via knowledge distillation. To better detect short actions, FGP first finds out high-action-frequency videos and then performs fine-grained detection. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets (ActivityNet-1.3, HACS, THUMOS14 and FineAction) demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed AFAN, especially for high-action-frequency videos.},

  abstract={In the context of label-efficient learning on video data, the distillation method and the structural design of the teacher-student architecture have a significant impact on knowledge distillation. However, the relationship between these factors has been overlooked in previous research. To address this gap, we propose a new weakly supervised learning framework for knowledge distillation in video classification that is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the student model. Our approach leverages the concept of substage-based learning to distill knowledge based on the combination of student substages and the correlation of corresponding substages. We also employ the progressive cascade training method to address the accuracy loss caused by the large capacity gap between the teacher and the student. Additionally, we propose a pseudo-label optimization strategy to improve the initial data label. To optimize the loss functions of different distillation substages during the training process, we introduce a new loss method based on feature distribution. We conduct extensive experiments on both real and simulated data sets, demonstrating that our proposed approach outperforms existing distillation methods in terms of knowledge distillation for video classification tasks. Our proposed substage-based distillation approach has the potential to inform future research on label-efficient learning for video data.},

  abstract={Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have been developed to enhance driving safety by issuing timely warnings to drivers. However, current ADAS do not take into account the driver's cognitive state when delivering warnings, which can result in false alarms and impact the driver's trust in the system. To address this issue, we propose a Cognitive-digital-twin-based Driving Assistance System (CDAS) that issues warnings tailored to the driver's perception of the driving environment and driving style. In this letter, we present a model of the driver's decision-making process that explicitly captures their perception of the driving environment, their utility evaluation of predicted future environments, and their driving style in terms of minimum acceptable risk. The cognitive digital twin of the driver is then created and updated by minimizing the discrepancy between the predicted and actual behaviors of the driver. With the cognitive digital twin, the CDAS warns the driver when there is a significant discrepancy between the predicted driving strategy based on partial observation and that based on full observation. This approach can more accurately identify risks that the driver is not aware of and provide warnings only when necessary. We conducted human and simulated experiments in a virtual driving environment, and our results demonstrate that our proposed CDAS has a similar perception of risky behaviors compared to humans. Furthermore, the digital twin learning framework can identify the driving styles of human participants and accurately predict their driving strategies. Additionally, our proposed cognitive driving assistance system provides fewer false warnings and avoids more collisions compared to state-of-the-art ADAS algorithms. Our research shows that incorporating the driver's cognitive state and driving style can enhance the effectiveness and safety of driving assistance systems.},

Because of the expensive and limited amounts of labelled data, the pretraining strategy has become the de facto standard for ABSA. However, there always exists a severe domain shift between the pretraining and downstream ABSA datasets, which hinders effective knowledge transfer when directly fine-tuning, making the downstream task suboptimal. To mitigate this domain shift, we introduce a unified alignment pretraining framework into the vanilla pretrain-finetune pipeline, that has both instance- and knowledge-level alignments. Specifically, we first devise a novel coarse-to-fine retrieval sampling approach to select target domain-related instances from the large-scale pretraining dataset, thus aligning the instances between pretraining and the target domains (First Stage). Then, we introduce a knowledge guidance-based strategy to further bridge the domain gap at the knowledge level. In practice, we formulate the model pretrained on the sampled instances into a knowledge guidance model and a learner model. On the target dataset, we design an on-the-fly teacher-student joint fine-tuning approach to progressively transfer the knowledge from the knowledge guidance model to the learner model (Second Stage). Therefore, the learner model can maintain more domain-invariant knowledge when learning new knowledge from the target dataset. In the Third Stage, the learner model is finetuned to better adapt its learned knowledge to the target dataset. Extensive experiments and analyses on several ABSA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposed pretraining framework.},

  abstract={With the development of deep learning and advances in the hardware industry, deep neural network with large amounts of parameters has ushered in better and more accurate prediction results, but also increases GPU resource costs. In this way, the deployment of models in terminals become a new problem, deduction time also costs a lot. To address these issues, we propose a model-assisted approach on feature-based knowledge distillation by introducing an auxiliary model together with the teacher model to guide the learning of the student model. We use auxiliary model to reducing the gap caused by structural and scale differences between the teacher model and the student model. The result shows that the prediction accuracy improved significantly also maintain a good generation ability. The choice of student models still remains problem in the field of knowledge distillation still, and the differences in the structure of the teacher model student models are still the important factors affecting the results of knowledge distillation. Therefore, this paper focuses on the accuracy and generation ability of student model on the distillation results, based on which a model-assisted boosting method is proposed, in which the knowledge are migrated to the student model by the teacher model together with the auxiliary model.},

  abstract={Driven by the opportunities for condition monitoring and new business models, Digital Twins have become a popular topic within research and industrial application over the last years. Therefore, universities must integrate the development of Digital Twins into their educational program to enable future engineers to overcome the challenges concomitant with Digital Twins. While a theoretical basis for Digital Twins is crucial e.g., hardware-software integration, Internet of Things (IoT) or simulation models, a practical combination of these heterogeneous components is also necessary to introduce the Digital Twin as a whole concept. With Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) an approach was introduced to grasp complexity by using system models e.g., through SysML diagrams. Digital Twins are an example for advanced systems shaped by high complexity. The usage of system models is therefore likely. With this contribution, a concept is presented to combine system models and Digital Twins to create a prototype for academic education and the conduction of student projects.},

The lack of data led us to build a digital twin that allows us to build the dataset necessary to train the model. The data measured on the switches correspond to time series. We are therefore interested in supervised learning methods based on time series. Our study shows that the STSF model is the best suited for the classification of switch faults. The study then focused on characterizing the robustness of the model with respect to noises that can disturb the measurements. It also showed that the current I and the angular velocity (j) are the most relevant data for learning.

  abstract={Identifying the locations of cyber attacks in power distribution systems is critical to take immediate and effective mitigation actions. This article introduces a novel real-time attack localization strategy for power distribution systems utilizing a Digital Twin (DT) as a cyber-physical real-time reference model that mimics the cyber-physical dynamic characteristics of the actual system. The proposed approach takes advantage of the DT-based reference model as well as the physical characteristics of the radial distribution network to compute a new metric, namely Residual Rate of Change (RRC), which allows differentiating False Data Injection (FDI) attacks on load measurements and protective devices. The RRC enables the determination of the attack's location by constructing a directed graph that characterizes the physical dependencies of protective devices. The proposed attack localization method is implemented on a testbed consisting of a digital real-time simulator, feeder protection devices, a real-time automation controller, and advanced communication infrastructure for a power distribution system. The provided experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method to localize cyber attacks in various operation scenarios of the power distribution system. The results also illustrate that the introduced method outperforms a learning-based strategy in localizing different types of attacks in the test system.},

  abstract={In the age of digitalization, virtually everything around us is on the cloud. The metaverse allows people to perform the things they do in the real and virtual worlds. In the virtual world of the metaverse, everything from work to communication is on demand and connected. One of the advantages of the metaverse is the lack of physical barriers in development. Performing tests on expensive equipment are no longer expensive because companies do not have to purchase physical hardware. In addition, the risks in performing tests are virtually eliminated. Hardware errors may cause damage to a physical system, but in a metaverse, all one needs to do is reboot the virtual machine and have it reloaded with an operating system. In additive manufacturing, testing a 3D printer may take time and resources. Furthermore, miscalculations and unfavorable environmental conditions may lead to printing issues. Developing a simulation tool to test a 3D printer in variable environments is explored to address possible problems with additive manufacturing. The behavior of the digital twin will be diagnosed using various deep learning algorithms implemented in various studies. CNN-BiLSTM has proven to be the most accurate of the deep learning algorithms explored.},

To evaluate its performance, real-world flight tests were conducted on a scaled model of the KP-1, and results were compared to those obtained from traditional control methods.

  abstract={The efficiency, return on investment, and output of Solar power plants are all significantly impacted by the development of Digital Twin technology. Digital Twining of the Solar PV system will help to improve the predictability of the power output, gather the necessary information for energy forecasting (predict ahead the power output to balance supply and demand) and power system default detection. The main objective of this study is to develop a Digital Twin Solar PV system. The technical approach used to develop a Solar PV Digital Twin includes: (1) real time data collection of power output from Solar PV system using smart sensors, (2) development, calibration, and validation of a Solar PV system model using MATLAB (3) development and testing the accuracy of LSTM-based forecasting model to predict ahead (15 mins) the Solar PV electrical power output using historical data. The results show that the Solar PV Digital Twin compares well with the targeted data from the real system (data from sensors of the physical Solar PV system). The accuracy of the models was assessed using the coefficient of correlation (R). The results show that the Solar PV Digital Twin simulation and forecasting models have R-values of 0.99893 and 0.99427, respectively. To help an asset owner or operator to visualize the performance of Digital Twin, a dashboard application was developed using MATLAB App Designer. The dashboard shows current, historical, and continuously forecasts future energy consumption and production to balance supply and demand. The development of Digital Twin technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning predictive tools for monitoring, forecasting and maintenance of Solar PV plants are keys to reach the Net Zero Energy Building goals. Additionally, to ensure the reproducibility of the research, the irradiance measurements data was published in a GitHub repository.},

  abstract={Federated learning (FL) allows for the decentralized training of a global model on edge devices without transferring data samples, thus preserving privacy. Due to the ubiquitous wearable devices and mobile devices with health applications, FL has shown promise in the medical field for applications such as medical imaging, disease diagnosis, and electronic health record (EHR) analysis. However, slower edge devices with limited resources can slow down the training process. To address this issue and increase efficiency, we propose the use of Asynchronous Federated Learning with Knowledge Distillation (AsyncFedKD). AsyncFedKD asynchronously trains a lightweight global student model using a pre-trained teacher model, preventing a decrease in training efficiency due to slow edge devices. The knowledge distillation aspect of AsyncFedKD effectively compresses the size of model parameters for efficient communication during training. AsyncFedKD has been tested on a sensitive mammography cancer dataset and achieved an accuracy of 88% on the global model.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in applying electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in lung monitoring due to its advantages of being noninvasive, nonionizing, real time, and functional imaging with no harmful side effects. However, the EIT images reconstructed by traditional algorithms suffer from low spatial resolution. This article proposes a novel EIT-based lung monitoring scheme by using a 3-D digital twin lung model and a deep learning-based image reconstruction algorithm. Unlike the static numerical or experimental simulations used in other data-driven EIT imaging methods, our digital twin lung model incorporates the biomechanical and electrical properties of the lung to generate a more realistic and dynamic dataset. Additionally, the image reconstruction network (IR-Net) is used to learn the prior information in the dataset and accurately reconstruct the conductivity variation within the lungs during respiration. The results indicate that EIT using a guided digital twin and deep learning-based image reconstruction has better accuracy and anti-noise performance compared to traditional EIT. The proposed EIT imaging framework provides a new idea for efficiently creating labeled EIT data and has potential to be used in various data-driven methods for electrical biomedical imaging.},

  abstract={Recent research has demonstrated that the heat induced by high data rate transmission could cause low-temperature burns. As a promising application for future wireless networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is capable of providing high data rate transmission for ground users. Inspired by this progress, this article focuses on the resource allocation for the UAV scenario and proposes a novel framework to consider the newly mentioned phenomenon named by power-consumption outage (PCO). Specifically, we give the analysis of heat transfer model in the smartphone based on which we initially integrate the influence of PCO into the optimization problem of the UAV scenario. Furthermore, to solve the problem with joint optimization of bandwidth allocation and trajectory design, we propose a machine learning model consisting of the position prediction based on echo state network and the joint optimization based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Due to the continuity in action space, DRL optimization is specifically implemented by the normalized advantage function algorithm. Besides, considering the restriction for the implementation of machine learning, we propose a digital twin-enabled architecture to provide a virtual environment for the training. Simulation results show the advantage of the proposed scheme in total throughput and the adaptability for trajectory design in the presence of PCO.},

  pages={1707-1720},
  abstract={Traditional centralized machine learning uses a large amount of data for model training, which may face some privacy and security problems. On the other hand, federated learning (FL), which focuses on privacy protection, also faces challenges such as core network congestion and limited mobile device (MD) resources. The computation offloading technology of mobile edge computing (MEC) can effectively alleviate these challenges, but it ignores the effect of user mobility and the unpredictable MEC environment. In this paper, we first propose an architecture that combines digital twin (DT) and MEC technologies with the FL framework, where the DT network can virtually imitate the statue of physical entities (PEs) and network topology to be used for real-time data analysis and network resource optimization. The computation offloading technology of MEC is used to alleviate resource constraints of MDs and the core network congestion. We further leverage the FL to construct DT models based on PEs’ running data. Then, we jointly optimize the problem of computation offloading and resource allocation to reduce the straggler effect in FL based on the framework. Since the solution of the objective function is a stochastic programming problem, we model a Markov decision process (MDP), and use the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to solve this objective function. The simulation results prove the feasibility of the proposed scheme, and the scheme can significantly reduce the total cost by about 50% and improve the communication performance compared with baseline schemes.},

  abstract={The fault diagnosis of rolling bearings is of utmost importance in industrial applications to ensure mechanical systems' reliability, safety, and economic viability. However, conventional data-driven fault diagnosis techniques mainly depend on a pre-existing dataset with complete failure modes and knowledge to serve as the training data, which may not be available or accessible in some crucial industrial scenarios. This can limit the practicality of these methodologies in real-world industrial applications. This article addresses this issue by developing a novel digital twin-enabled domain adversarial graph network (DT-DAGN). The main contributions of this article are as follows: 1) the development of a comprehensive and accurate digital twin model for rolling bearings that includes a dynamic simulation of the bearing's operational status using only its structural parameters and failure severity/size to obtain the system's vibration response, and 2) the development of a novel graph convolutional network-based transfer learning framework to transfer knowledge from simulated datasets to measured datasets, enabling effective fault diagnostics of bearings with limited knowledge. A series of experiments are applied to validate the efficacy of the developed methodology.},

Leveraging unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms, namely BiDirectional Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN), affinity propagation and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), we semantically model the complex distributions of ITS data streams and perform anomaly detection utilizing graph representations. Employing DT applications and diverse sensory measurements from the BeIntelli smart mobility platform of TU Berlin, we compare the performance of our approach with traditional and deep learning based methods in terms of detection accuracy and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC).

A learning-based BEB digital twin cloud platform is used to accurately predict BEB charge consumption on a per vehicle, per driver, and per route basis, and accurately predict the time-to-charge BEB batteries to any level. These predictions are then used by a Predictive Block Assignment module to maximize the BEB fleet utilization. This module computes the optimal BEB daily assignment and charge management strategy. A Depot Parking and Charging Queue Management module is used to autonomously park and charge the vehicles based on their charging demands. The paper discusses the technical approach and benefits of each level in the architecture and concludes with a realistic simulations study.

  abstract={Cooperation of automated vehicles (AVs) can improve safety, efficiency and comfort in traffic. Digital twins of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) play an important role in monitoring, managing and improving traffic. Computing a live digital twin of traffic requires as input live perception data of preferably multiple connected entities such as automated vehicles (AVs). One such type of perception data are evidential occupancy grid maps (OGMs). The computation of a digital twin involves their spatiotemporal alignment and fusion. In this work, we focus on the spatial alignment, also known as registration, and fusion of evidential occupancy grid maps of multiple automated vehicles. While there exists extensive research on the synchronization and fusion of object-based environment representations, the registration and fusion of OGMs originating from multiple connected vehicles has not been investigated much. We propose a methodology that involves training a deep neural network (DNN) to predict a fused evidential OGM from two OGMs computed by different AVs. The output includes an estimate of the first- and second-order uncertainty. We demonstrate that the DNN trained with synthetic data only outperforms a baseline approach based on coordinate transformation and combination rules also on real-world data. Experimental results on synthetic data show that our approach is able to compensate for spatial misalignments of up to 5 meters and 20 degrees.},

  abstract={Digital Twinning of physical world scenes onto the Metaverse is necessary for augmented reality (AR)-assisted driving. In AR-assisted driving, physical environment scenes are first captured by AR vehicles and are uploaded to the Metaverse for the construction of the Metaverse Map. However, the development of AR-assisted driving applications invites adversaries. These attackers may place adversarial patches on physical objects, seeking to contort the Metaverse Map. As real-time, accurate detection of adversarial patches is compute-intensive, these physical world scenes have to be offloaded to the Metaverse Map Base Station (MMBS) for computation. Therefore, we considered a scenario where AR vehicles capture physical world scenes and upload these scenes in real-time to the MMBSs. We formulated an optimization problem where the MMSP’s objective is to maximize adversarial patch detection mean Average Precision (mAP), while minimizing the computed AR scene uplink transmission latency and minimizing the worst-case (largest) AR vehicle’s uplink transmission battery charge consumption, through optimizing the AR vehicle-MMBS allocation, AR vehicle uplink scene resolution selection, and AR vehicle uplink power output selection. We proposed a Heterogeneous Action (HA) algorithm to tackle the proposed problem. Extensive experiments show our HA models outperforms baseline models when compared against key metrics.},

  abstract={The possibility of creating digital twins of physical objects for cultural heritage and electronics industry, is explored in this paper. Anyway, the presented approach could be applied to digital objects of any nature. The proposed seven-dimensional (7D) digital twin model extends beyond the standard three-dimensional voxel representation, incorporating full color representation via XYZ color coordinates, surface structure through optical coherence tomography, surface composition through spectral fingerprint and surface sound. Various technologies that can be used for this new type of 7D scanning are discussed, as well as a proposed file format for storing these digital twins. The benefits and current limitations of this process are also explored, with suggested strategies for overcoming these limitations. The creation of 7D digital twins presents new opportunities for preservation, study, and access to physical objects, and has the potential to revolutionize the way cultural heritage is experienced and shared. Exploration on combining digital twins with machine learning has also been done.},
