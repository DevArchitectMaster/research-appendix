  abstract={The article presents the design and expected results from the use of a digital twin monitoring and management system. It is a continuation of the multi-step improvement of the sensor assembly line until its full automation. Statistical control, machine learning, deep machine learning, fuzzy logic and neural networks have been applied to improve and optimize data selection and analysis. A model of digital twins is applied, in which the analysis and feedback for automatic optimal control are outside the work center of a server or cloud. With this powerful management model, many work centers are serviced. Thus, with the development of a single powerful analysis software from the machine manufacturer, many work centers can be managed. This makes the process more automatic and with a lower cost. A specific goal has been set to speed up the work of the automatic production center for assembling sensors and achieve a production cycle of 5 seconds with improved quality results. This is achieved by optimizing automatic visual control using digital twin analysis. Quality improvement has been achieved by improving the inputs of the assembly process using digital twin analysis.},

  year={2022},

  pages={894-901},
  abstract={The increasing demand for high-quality yet low-cost electrical machines for electric and hybrid electric vehicles requires optimizing manufacturing processes across all machine elements. The needle winding technology offers the potential to meet these requirements for the production of essential components: copper windings. Thereby, the understanding of wire behavior plays a key role. In particular geometric wire bending behavior significantly influences the planning and execution of winding trajectories. Thus, building on previous work, this paper takes further steps toward a data-driven empirical approach to modeling geometric wire bending behavior. The overarching goal is to provide an efficient and comprehensive model of wire bending geometry as a function of wire tensile force and wire exit angles at the needle outlet. Spline models generated with the help of a purpose-built test bench with a dedicated image processing pipeline serve as the basis for a simplified modeling approach. The proposed model is based on circular arcs with tangential linear functions, allowing the wire bending geometry to be defined with only three parameters. Qualitative analyses of the resulting model behavior and quantitative investigations of the model errors show accurate approximation results and confirm the suitability of the developed method.},

  abstract={On the one hand, laparoscopic surgery as medical state-of-the-art method is minimal invasive, and thus less stressful for patients. On the other hand, laparoscopy implies higher demands on physicians, such as mental load or preparation time, hence appropriate technical support is essential for quality and suc-cess. Medical Digital Twins provide an integrated and virtual representation of patients' and organs' data, and thus a generic concept to make complex information accessible by surgeons. In this way, minimal invasive surgery could be improved significantly, but requires also a much more complex software system to achieve the various resulting requirements. The biggest challenges for these systems are the safe and precise mapping of the digital twin to reality, i.e. dealing with deformations, movement and distortions, as well as balance out the competing requirement for intuitive and immersive user access and security. The case study ARAILIS is presented as a proof in concept for such a system and provides a starting point for further research. Based on the insights delivered by this prototype, a vision for future Medical Digital Twins in surgery is derived and discussed.},

  abstract={A pilot study that explores the design, implementation, and affordances of using a virtual learning environment (VLE) in the form of highly customized WebVR in Model United Nations (MUN) simulations. A digital twin of the UN Security Council Chamber in New York was created for the simulations. A small group of students (n=7) take part in a series of simulations in virtual reality to simulate a session for the UN Security Council in virtual reality. A series of sessions with different objectives that seek to explore the affordances of WebVR as an online collaborative tool. The study documents the complete journey of the design of this intervention from training and onboarding participants, to customizing simulation parameters, and observing/polling participation for acceptance/reactions. The design and analysis come from both the perspectives of a veteran MUN facilitator seeking best practices and an educational technologist looking for design principles. The study analyzes the perspectives from the participants and facilitators to find hints at best practices and design principles for MUN simulations in VR. The findings show the need for iteration or re-design of activities from those of more traditional MUN facilitation such as face-to-face or teleconference to align with what VLEs can offer.},

  abstract={Cultural Heritage Buildings need to be preserved through interventions and actions that ensure accessibility and availability to present and future generations. The diffusion o f new technologies, including low-cost sensors and devices, has introduced many possibilities and strategies to monitor environments, including Historical and Cultural value buildings. Based on the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, modern devices and sensors can collect and manage helpful information to build a Digital Twin of the surrounding environment. In this scenario, reproducing a Digital Twin of Cultural Heritage Buildings could be crucial to monitoring, managing, and performing action aiming to protect them. One of the challenges in recent years is the automatic analysis of collected information. This paper introduces a novel approach to protecting Buildings using Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM), which leverages a sensor network and Deep Learning techniques to analyze sensor data. A case study related to the Archeological Park of Pompeii will be presented, where real-time collected data is managed and shared via a web-cloud-IoT platform. Then, collected data are analyzed through a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to prevent future issues related to Cultural Heritage Buildings, particularly humidity inside structures, which is crucial for ancient building preservation.},

  pages={12154-12168},
  abstract={Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a promising technology to create digital replicas of physical vehicles to facilitate driving in Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, due to the uneven distribution of vehicles in the networks and the dynamics of heterogeneous wireless links, how to optimize the connection along the vehicle's trip between the vehicle and its DT to achieve the lowest cost (i.e., delay and energy consumption) is a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we investigate the joint network selection and power level allocation problem in the data synchronization issue between vehicles and DTs in the heterogeneous access networks. In order to better use the information shared by DT to facilitate the data synchronization process, we propose a learning-based heterogeneous network selection scheme in DT empowered IoV. First, we consider the data divided into blocks and model the data synchronization problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to minimize the long-term cost in terms of the delay and energy consumption. Based on the information obtained from the digital twin communications, we develop an actor-critic learning approach to solve the MDP problem with the block-level state method, and obtain the optimal network selection strategy for the vehicles. In addition, we explore the capability of digital twins by applying transfer learning. The vehicles are divided into two types, i.e., learner vehicles and expert vehicles, so that the knowledge can be transferred from the expert vehicles to the learner vehicles to effectively improve the learning efficiency and decrease the data synchronization latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme can effectively find the optimal network selection policy and achieve the fast convergence and better performance compared with existing related approaches.},

  title={Dual-Level Knowledge Distillation via Knowledge Alignment and Correlation}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={1-11},
  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a widely used technique for model compression and knowledge transfer. We find that the standard KD method performs the knowledge alignment on an individual sample indirectly via class prototypes and neglects the structural knowledge between different samples, namely, knowledge correlation. Although recent contrastive learning-based distillation methods can be decomposed into knowledge alignment and correlation, their correlation objectives undesirably push apart representations of samples from the same class, leading to inferior distillation results. To improve the distillation performance, in this work, we propose a novel knowledge correlation objective and introduce the dual-level knowledge distillation (DLKD), which explicitly combines knowledge alignment and correlation together instead of using one single contrastive objective. We show that both knowledge alignment and correlation are necessary to improve the distillation performance. In particular, knowledge correlation can serve as an effective regularization to learn generalized representations. The proposed DLKD is task-agnostic and model-agnostic, and enables effective knowledge transfer from supervised or self-supervised pretrained teachers to students. Experiments show that DLKD outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on a large number of experimental settings including: 1) pretraining strategies; 2) network architectures; 3) datasets; and 4) tasks.},

  abstract={In order for autonomously navigating Unmanned Air Vehicles(UAVs) to be implemented in day-to-day life, proof of safe operation will be necessary for all realistic navigation scenarios. For Deep Learning powered navigation protocols, this requirement is challenging to fulfil as the performance of a network is impacted by how much the test case deviates from data that the network was trained on. Though networks can generalise to manage multiple scenarios in the same task, they require additional data representing those cases which can be costly to gather. In this work, a solution to this data acquisition problem is suggested by way of the implementation of a visually realistic, yet artificial, simulated dataset. A method is presented for the creation of a “Digital Twin Area” inside of a modern high fidelity game engine using 3D scanned models of physical locations, and a realistic dataset of each area is created to showcase this concept.},

  abstract={Color restoration of endoscopic images is an urgent clinical need during photodynamic surgery. In recent years, deep learning methods achieved notable results in the fields of image processing. The model compression algorithm and hardware performance enhancement improved the model inference speed. It is possible to apply deep learning methods to the task of endoscopic image color restoration during surgery. However, experiments show that model compression can lead to image deterioration. To solve this issue, we propose a fast color restoration method for endoscopic images, which use multiscale discriminator based on model compression. Initially, we train a CycleGAN teacher network with multiscale discriminator. Then, we obtain the student model through knowledge distillation and neural architecture search. We use the trained teacher discriminator to guide the student model and add feature matching loss to stabilize the training process. Experiments show that our method ameliorates the performance of compressed models.},

  abstract={The fast proliferation of digital twin (DT) establishes a direct connection between the physical entity and its deployed digital representation. As markets shift toward mass customization and new service delivery models, the digital representation has become more adaptive and agile by forming digital twin networks (DTNs). The DTN institutes a real-time single source of truth everywhere. However, there are several issues preventing DTNs from further application, including centralized processing, data falsification, privacy leakage, lack of incentive mechanism, and so on. To make DTN better meet the ever changing demands, we propose a novel block-chain-enabled adaptive asynchronous federated learning (FedTwin) paradigm for privacy-preserving and decentralized DTNs. We design Proof-of-Federalism (PoF), which is a tailor-made consensus algorithm for autonomous DTNs. In each DT's local training phase, generative adversarial network enhanced differential privacy is used to protect the privacy of local model parameters, while a modified Isolation Forest is deployed to filter out the falsified DTs. In the global aggregation phase, an improved Markov decision process is leveraged to select optimal DTs to achieve adaptive asynchronous aggregation while providing a rollback mechanism to redact the falsified global models. With this article, we aim to provide insights to forthcoming researchers and readers in this under-explored domain.},

  abstract={Emotion recognition (ER) in healthcare has drawn substantial attention owing to recent advancements in machine-learning (ML) and deep-learning (DL) techniques. The ER system, along with a digital twin of a person in real time, will facilitate the monitoring, understanding, and improvement of the physical entity’s capabilities, as well as provide constant input to improve quality of life and well-being for personalized healthcare. However, building such ER systems in real time involves technical challenges, such as limited datasets, occlusion and lighting issues, identifying important features, false classification of emotions, and high implementation costs. To resolve this issue, we built a simple, efficient, and adaptable ER system by acquiring and processing images in real time using a web camera. In addition, we propose an end-to-end framework that combines an ER system with a digital twin setup, in which the predicted result can be analyzed and tested prior to providing the best possible personal healthcare treatment before it leads to any life-threatening disease. Our proposed ER system achieved promising results in less training time without compromising the accuracy. Thus, in real time, it will be helpful in healthcare centers to monitor a patient’s health condition, early diagnosis of life-threatening diseases, and to obtain the best and most effective treatment for patients during emergencies.},

  title={SPD: Semi-Supervised Learning and Progressive Distillation for 3-D Detection}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-11},
  abstract={Current learning-based 3-D object detection accuracy is heavily impacted by the annotation quality. It is still a challenge to expect an overall high detection accuracy for all classes under different scenarios given the dataset sparsity. To mitigate this challenge, this article proposes a novel method called semi-supervised learning and progressive distillation (SPD), which uses semi-supervised learning (SSL) and knowledge distillation to improve label efficiency. The SPD uses two big backbones to hand the unlabeled/labeled input data augmented by the periodic IO augmentation (PA). Then the backbones are compressed using progressive distillation (PD). Precisely, PA periodically shifts the data augmentation operations between the input and output of the big backbone, aiming to improve the network&#x2019;s generalization of the unseen and unlabeled data. Using the big backbone can benefit from large-scale augmented data better than the small one. And two backbones are trained by the data scale and ratio-sensitive loss (data-loss). It solves the over-flat caused by the large-scale unlabeled data from PA and helps the big backbone prevent overfitting on the limited-scale labeled data. Hence, using the PA and data loss during SSL training dramatically improves the label efficiency. Next, the trained big backbone set as the teacher CNN is progressively distilled to obtain a small student model, referenced as PD. PD mitigates the problem that student CNN performance degrades when the gap between the student and the teacher is oversized. Extensive experiments are conducted on the indoor datasets SUN RGB-D and ScanNetV2 and outdoor dataset KITTI. Using only 50% labeled data and a 27% smaller model size, SPD performs 0.32 higher than the fully supervised VoteNetqi2019deep which is adopted as our backbone. Besides, using only 2% labeled data, compared to the other fully supervised backbone PV-RCNNshi2020pv, SPD accomplishes a similar accuracy (84.1 and 84.83) and 30% less inference time.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a fast-growing field, where reliable systems are made for high resource languages and for adult’s speech. However, performance of such ASR system is inefficient for children speech, due to numerous acoustic variability in children speech and scarcity of resources. In this paper, we propose to use the unlabeled data extensively to develop ASR system for low resourced children speech. State-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 is the baseline ASR technique used here. The baseline’s performance is further enhanced with the intuition of Noisy Student Teacher (NST) learning. The proposed technique is not only limited to introducing the use of soft labels (i.e., word-level transcription) of unlabeled data, but also adapts the learning of teacher model or preceding student model, which results in reduction of the redundant training significantly. To that effect, a detailed analysis is reported in this paper, as there is a difference in teacher and student learning. In ASR experiments, character-level tokenization was used and hence, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss was used for fine-tuning. Due to computational limitations, experiments are performed with approximately 12 hours of training, and 5 hours of development and test data was used from standard My Science Tutor (MyST) corpus. The baseline wav2vec 2.0 achieves 34% WER, while relatively 10% of performance was improved using the proposed approach. Further, the analysis of performance loss and effect of language model is discussed in details.},

The heterogeneity of IoT use cases usually makes the development of digital twins extremely application-specific as well as prone to interoperability issues. To overcome these two challenges, we propose WoTwins, a framework that, on one side, leverages the W3C Web of Things (WoT) standard to model data and entities, and, on the other side, generates automatically Digital Twins of existing Web Things by modeling their state space through a Markov Decision Process (MDP) graph and by predicting its behavior though Machine Learning techniques. We conduct experiments on a simulated use cases related to IoT robotics to evaluate our proposal.},

  abstract={This study attempts to reveal the intelligent recommendation mechanism of online learning resources. The “multimodal data fusion” aspect is adopted, illustrating online learning resource modeling, learning preference modeling, learning preference evolution, and referral engine smart design. Multimodal learning resources are key constituents of multidimensional intelligent recommendation services. The learner model that integrates multimodal preference data is the key to implementing smart recommendations. Learning preference evolution is a key factor in sustaining learner model robustness. The intelligent recommendation engine is the technical guarantee for developing an intelligent recommendation. Providing learning resources is an important part of online learning services, which mediate online learning processes. Intelligent recommendation, as an effective personalized servicing strategy, recommends differentiated, personalized, and precise learning resources to learners, thereby promoting the effectiveness of online learning performance. This study constructs a framework that reveals an intelligent recommendation mechanism for online learning resources.},

  abstract={Myopia has become a major public health problem affecting the eye health of our citizens, especially teenagers. Fundus images can be obtained non-invasively and can be used to monitor and follow up on the progress in high myopia. However, with the development of artificial intelligence, it is still difficult to establish a computer-aided diagnosis model for high myopia with young children as research objects, mainly because 1) it is very difficult to collect labeled fundus images, and there is no large amount of such data that can be freely accessed; 2) hard samples which have clinical significance for population screening and diagnosis are rare and indistinguishable. To solve these problems, we propose a high myopia detection model on fundus images based on curriculum learning. We design a dual-curriculum generation module, which aims to use the expert model to endow the curriculum with new training indicators so that the student model can gradually and robustly identify hard samples. Compared with the baseline, our framework significantly improves the convergence speed of the training process and achieves the best performance during testing. Experimental results on a high myopia fundus images dataset show that our framework provides efficient and accurate detection and outperforms other methods.},

  abstract={Machine learning (ML) applications for wireless communications have gained momentum on the standardization discussions for 5G advanced and beyond. One of the biggest challenges for real world ML deployment is the need for labeled signals and big measurement campaigns. To overcome those problems, we propose the use of untrained neural networks (UNNs) for MIMO channel recreation/estimation and low over-head reporting. The UNNs learn the propagation environment by fitting a few channel measurements and we exploit their learned prior to provide higher channel estimation gains. Moreover, we present a UNN for simultaneous channel recreation for multiple users, or multiple user equipment (UE) positions, in which we have a trade-off between the estimated channel gain and the number of parameters. Our results show that transfer learning techniques are effective in accessing the learned prior on the environment structure as they provide higher channel gain for neighbouring users. Moreover, the proposed UNN channel state information (CSI) estimators are under-parameterized and can further enable low-overhead CSI reporting.},

  abstract={The emergence of digital twin technology is expected to reduce the significant cost of traditional physical debugging. Moreover, it can also fully combine IoT real-time data, large data analysis, and simulation, to make the best decisions. In the digital twin network, the data distribution and computing power of different device nodes shows great heterogeneity, but the internal node data are independent and identically distributed. Therefore, our learning algorithm should be able to learn not only the network commonality, but also the node specificity. In order to provide secure and personalised services for different device nodes, a polymorphic learning (PL) framework is proposed in this paper. PL divides the classical neural network model into a homomorphic model and a polymorphic model to realise flexible network control. Finally, the advantages of the PL algorithm in the collaborative optimisation of different nodes are proven through simulation experiments, and the algorithm running process is simulated through a classic case, with the final results proving the superiority of the algorithm.},

  abstract={Future wireless services will focus on improving the quality of life by enabling various applications, such as extended reality, brain-computer interaction, and healthcare. These applications will have diverse performance requirements (e.g., user-defined quality of experience metrics, latency, and reliability) which will be challenging to be fulfilled by existing wireless systems. To meet the diverse requirements of the emerging applications, the concept of digital twins has been recently proposed. A digital twin uses a virtual representation along with security-related technologies (e.g., blockchain), communication technologies (e.g., 6G), computing technologies (e.g., edge computing), and machine learning, so as to enable the smart applications. In this tutorial, we present a comprehensive overview on digital twins for wireless systems. First, we present the fundamental concepts (i.e., design aspects, high-level architecture, and frameworks) of digital twins for wireless systems. Second, a comprehensive taxonomy is devised for two aspects, namely, twins for wireless and wireless for twins. For the twins for wireless aspect, we consider issues related to design of twin objects, physical devices, and interface, as well as prototyping, deployment trends, incentive mechanism, isolation of twins, and decoupling. For the wireless for twins aspect, we consider issues related to accessing twin objects, security and privacy, and air interface design are considered.

  abstract={Knowledge distillation is an effective model compression technology. As the main research branch, the knowledge distillation based on the middle layer focuses on extracting the network representation knowledge in the hidden layer to improve student learning performance. To fully utilize the process knowledge of the teacher model, an algorithm of the feature reconstruction based on middle-layer feature maps is proposed, which embeds middle-layer feature maps of the student network into the teacher network group by group. We introduce the intermediate soft-hard label contained process knowledge of the network with the help of pre-trained module group of the teacher network in loss function. This can increase the coupling of the teacher-student network in the process of knowledge transfer and improve the intrinsic knowledge inheritance of the compressed student model to the teacher network. The experimental results on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 verify the effectiveness and scalability of this method.},

  abstract={To realize high-accuracy physical-cyber digital twin (DT) mapping in a manufacturing system, a huge amount of data need to be collected and analyzed in real-time. Traditional DTs systems are deployed in cloud or edge servers independently, whilst it is hard to apply in real production systems due to the high interaction or execution delay. This results in a low consistency in the temporal dimension of the physical-cyber model. In this work, we propose a novel efficient edge-cloud DT manufacturing system, which is inspired by resource scheduling technology. Specifically, an edge-cloud collaborative DTs system deployment architecture is first constructed. Then, deterministic and uncertainty optimization adaptive strategies are presented to choose a more powerful server for running DT-based applications. We model the adaptive optimization problems as dynamic programming problems and propose a novel collaborative clustering parallel Q-learning (CCPQL) algorithm and prediction-based CCPQL to solve the problems. The proposed approach reduces the total delay with a higher convergence rate. Numerical simulation results are provided to validate the approach, which would have great potential in dynamic and complex industrial internet environments.},

  abstract={In the transportation business, battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs) are regarded the immediate solution to internal combustion engines in light of the growth in environmental pollution. While expanding the use of electric vehicles, battery-related difficulties such as range anxiety, safety concerns, cost, and the availability of charging stations are important concerns. A precise online estimate of the battery’s State of Health (SoH) has the ability to resolve some of these issues. However, computing the SoH on EVs is computationally intensive, necessitating expensive onboard integrated electronics and rapidly draining the EV battery. In addition, the SoH estimating algorithms currently available do not utilise incremental battery usage data. This research presents a digital twin of the EV battery as a solution to the difficulty of onboard computation for incremental SoH prediction. It enables intensive computing and analytics to be performed in the cloud instead of a vehicle’s battery management system (BMS). It calculates the SoH of the battery using an incremental learning method with a mean square error of 0.023.},

For this reason, monitoring the battery state of charge and state of health during the EV lifetime is a very relevant problem. This work proposes the structure of a battery digital twin designed to reflect battery dynamics at the run time accurately. To ensure a high degree of correctness concerning non-linear phenomena, the digital twin relies on data-driven models trained on traces of battery evolution over time: a state of health model, repeatedly executed to estimate the degradation of maximum battery capacity, and a state of charge model, retrained periodically to reflect the impact of aging. The proposed digital twin structure will be exemplified on a public dataset to motivate its adoption and prove its effectiveness, with a high degree of accuracy and inference and retraining times compatible with onboard execution.},

One important aspect of situation awareness is the correct and thorough monitoring of air pollutants. The monitoring is threatened by sensor faults, power or network failures, or other hazards leading to missing or incorrect data transmission. For this reason, in this work we propose two complementary approaches for predicting missing sensor data and a combined technique for detecting outliers. The proposed solution can enhance the performance of low-cost sensor systems, closing the gap of missing measurements due to network unavailability, detecting drift and outliers thus paving the way to its use as an alert system for reportable events. The techniques have been deployed and tested also in a low power microcontroller environment, verifying the suitability of such a computing power to perform the inference locally, leading the way to an edge implementation of a virtual sensor digital twin.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={An electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is currently accepted as a standard for automatic sleep staging. Lately, Near-human accuracy in automated sleep staging has been achievable by Deep Learning (DL) based approaches, enabling multi-fold progress in this area. However, An extensive and expensive clinical setup is required for EEG based sleep staging. Additionally, the EEG setup being obtrusive in nature and requiring an expert for setup adds to the inconvenience of the subject under study, making it adverse in the point of care setting. An unobtrusive and more suitable alternative to EEG is Electrocardiogram (ECG). Unsurprisingly, compared to EEG in sleep staging, its performance remains sub-par. In order to take advantage of both the modalities, transferring knowledge from EEG to ECG is a reasonable approach, ultimately boosting the performance of ECG based sleep staging. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a promising notion in DL that shares knowledge from a superior performing but usually more complex teacher model to an inferior but compact student model. Building upon this concept, a cross-modality KD framework assisting features learned through models trained on EEG to improve ECG-based sleep staging performance is proposed. Additionally, to better understand the distillation approach, extensive experimentation on the independent modules of the proposed model was conducted. Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) dataset consisting of 200 subjects was utilized for this study. The results from the proposed model for weighted-F1-score in 3-class and 4-class sleep staging showed a 13.40 % and 14.30 % improvement, respectively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of KD for single-channel ECG based sleep staging's performance enhancement in 3-class (W-R-N) and 4-class (W-R-L-D) classification.},

  pages={1329-1341},
  abstract={We present RemixIT, a simple yet effective self-supervised method for training speech enhancement without the need of a single isolated in-domain speech nor a noise waveform. Our approach overcomes limitations of previous methods which make them dependent on clean in-domain target signals and thus, sensitive to any domain mismatch between train and test samples. RemixIT is based on a continuous self-training scheme in which a pre-trained teacher model on out-of-domain data infers estimated pseudo-target signals for in-domain mixtures. Then, by permuting the estimated clean and noise signals and remixing them together, we generate a new set of bootstrapped mixtures and corresponding pseudo-targets which are used to train the student network. Vice-versa, the teacher periodically refines its estimates using the updated parameters of the latest student models. Experimental results on multiple speech enhancement datasets and tasks not only show the superiority of our method over prior approaches but also showcase that RemixIT can be combined with any separation model as well as be applied towards any semi-supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation task. Our analysis, paired with empirical evidence, sheds light on the inside functioning of our self-training scheme wherein the student model keeps obtaining better performance while observing severely degraded pseudo-targets.},

  abstract={This paper collects the positions of four experts who participated in a panel on simulation-based policy support. The experts are well known for their contributions in this domain, predominantly for their use of agent-based approaches. The first section addresses the increasing requirements to integrate social modeling to support the evaluation of the socio-economic impact of policies, including questions of equity. Artificial societies are presented as enablers. The second section observes that the purpose of a simulation model is very much linked to its usefulness for supporting policy decisions. This implies requirements for learning agents and better representation of time and space. The third section focuses on the need to give agents more active behavior, to let them drive the action. While digital twin technology promises to help, the current state of the art seems insufficient. The section closes by looking at trust in simulation models, which will be needed for policy support.},

  abstract={Deep Metric Learning (DML) methods have been proven relevant for visual similarity learning. However, they sometimes lack generalization properties because they are trained often using an inappropriate sample selection strategy or due to the difficulty of the dataset caused by a distributional shift in the data. These represent a significant drawback when attempting to learn the underlying data manifold. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop better ways of obtaining generalization and representation of the underlying manifold. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to DML that we call Guided Deep Metric Learning, a novel architecture oriented to learning more compact clusters, improving generalization under distributional shifts in DML. This novel architecture consists of two independent models: A multi-branch master model, inspired from a Few-Shot Learning (FSL) perspective, generates a reduced hypothesis space based on prior knowledge from labeled data, which guides or regularizes the decision boundary of a student model during training under an offline knowledge distillation scheme. Experiments have shown that the proposed method is capable of a better manifold generalization and representation to up to 40% improvement (Recall@1, CIFAR10), using guidelines suggested by Musgrave et al. to perform a more fair and realistic comparison, which is currently absent in the literature.},

  pages={4230-4239},
  abstract={Despite the outstanding success of self-supervised pretraining methods for video representation learning, they generalise poorly when the unlabeled dataset for pretraining is small or the domain difference between unlabelled data in source task (pretraining) and labeled data in target task (finetuning) is significant. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel approach to complement self-supervised pretraining via an auxiliary pretraining phase, based on knowledge similarity distillation, auxSKD, for better generalisation with a significantly smaller amount of video data, e.g. Kinetics-100 rather than Kinetics-400. Our method deploys a teacher network that iteratively distils its knowledge to the student model by capturing the similarity information between segments of unlabelled video data. The student model meanwhile solves a pretext task by exploiting this prior knowledge. We also introduce a novel pretext task, Video Segment Pace Prediction or VSPP, which requires our model to predict the playback speed of a randomly selected segment of the input video to provide more reliable self-supervised representations. Our experimental results show superior results to the state of the art on both UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets when pretraining on K100 in apple-to-apple comparisons. Additionally, we show that our auxiliary pretraining, auxSKD, when added as an extra pretraining phase to recent state of the art self-supervised methods (i.e. VCOP, VideoPace, and RSPNet), improves their results on UCF101 and HMDB51.

  year={2022},

  number={},
  pages={1-12},
  abstract={This article proposes an efficient federated distillation learning system (EFDLS) for multitask time series classification (TSC). EFDLS consists of a central server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run different TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components: a feature-based student–teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM) scheme. For each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its teacher’s hidden layers to its student’s hidden layers via knowledge distillation, where the teacher and student have identical network structures. For each connected user, its student model’s hidden layers’ weights are uploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the server, with the least square distance (LSD) used to measure the similarity between the weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected user such that the user’s and its partner’s weights are the closest among all the weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user’s and its partner’s weights to these two users which then load the received weights to their teachers’ hidden layers. Experimental results show that compared with a number of state-of-the-art federated learning (FL) algorithms, our proposed EFDLS wins 20 out of 44 standard UCR2018 datasets and achieves the highest mean accuracy (70.14%) on these datasets. In particular, compared with a single-task baseline, EFDLS obtains 32/4/8 regarding “win”/“tie”/“lose” and results in an improvement of approximately 4% in terms of mean accuracy.},

  abstract={In this article, we proposed an autonomous mobile robot (AMR) capable of conducting multiple deep learning inferences by a computing network as a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). In view of industry 4.0, a five-layered CPS architecture including Component, Intelligence, Cyber, Configuration, and Deployment was devised. Mechatronic control of the two-wheeled self-balancing AMR presents the first challenge to embedded computing, whereas multiple deep learning modules for visual navigation and localization further escalate the stake. To meet the challenge of real-time and affordable computing, we constructed an embedded cluster based on Raspberry Pi4s and Intel NCS2 for simultaneous intelligent inference and data exchange. We tested the performances of three networking methods, Network File System (NFS), Socket Server with Multiple Clients (SSMC), and ROS TO PIC (ROS-T), and reported the comparison. We also conducted a series of field tests on autonomous corridor navigation, localization, object delivery, and object pick-and-place to verify the performance of the self-balancing AMR. The results showed high success rates with sufficient spatial precision, stability, and robust loop closure. The web-based console realizes the functions of the digital twin and provides connectivity to higher-level management systems.},

  abstract={The sixth-generation (6G) wireless network is conceptualized to provide ubiquitous and reliable network access through effective inter-networking among space, air, and terrestrial networks, while posing considerable pressure on dynamic network orchestration. Digital twin (DT) provides an alternative approach to proactively make real-time resource allocation by mapping and learning the complex network topology. However, the dual challenges of limited energy capacity and insufficient computing power of unmanned aerial vehicles make it difficult to establish digital twin on aerial networks. In light of this, in this paper, we propose a lightweight DT empowered air-ground network architecture, where the DT modelling task is distributed to diverse ground devices based on federated learning. To improve the efficiency of DT modelling, we design a distributed incentive mechanism that incentivizes high-performance ground devices to take part in federated learning. Considering the computing burden and possible private disclosure caused by the incentive, we further solve the incentive scheme with a new distributed algorithm. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight DT scheme in energy consumption and model accuracy.},

  abstract={Task scheduling is a critical problem when one user offloads multiple different tasks to the edge server. When a user has multiple tasks to offload and only one task can be transmitted to server at a time, while server processes tasks according to the transmission order, the problem is NP-hard. However, it is difficult for traditional optimization methods to quickly obtain the optimal solution, while approaches based on reinforcement learning face with the challenge of excessively large action space and slow convergence. In this paper, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-assisted RL-based task scheduling method in order to improve the performance and convergence of the RL. We use DT to simulate the results of different decisions made by the agent, so that one agent can try multiple actions at a time, or, similarly, multiple agents can interact with environment in parallel in DT. In this way, the exploration efficiency of RL can be significantly improved via DT, and thus RL can converges faster and local optimality is less likely to happen. Particularly, two algorithms are designed to made task scheduling decisions, i.e., DT-assisted asynchronous Q-learning (DTAQL) and DT-assisted exploring Q-learning (DTEQL). Simulation results show that both algorithms significantly improve the convergence speed of Q-learning by increasing the exploration efficiency.},

  abstract={In-depth analysis of medical data through machine learning to achieve disease prediction is beneficial to the early detection and treatment of diseases. However, medical data involves mass patient privacy, and datasets of different medical institutions cannot be directly shared due to privacy protection. So medical data often exists in the form of data islands, which makes it difficult for most existing prediction models to complete disease prediction. In this paper, a digital twin assisted efficient clustering Federated Learning (FL) algorithm for disease prediction is proposed. It can break data islands to predict diseases on the premise of privacy security. Firstly, we design an efficient clustering Federated Learning with Client Selection (FLCS) protocol based on heterogeneity and contribution to improve the training efficiency and prediction accuracy. Secondly, we use digital twin to assist the FLCS protocol to carry out large-scale prediction. In addition, the shapley value introduced in the calculation of client contribution makes the model interpretable and enhances the reliability of prediction results. Finally, the evaluation results show that compared with the common prediction models and FedAvg algorithm, the FLCS protocol assisted by digital twin has better efficiency and accuracy in binary classification prediction.},

In this paper, we propose a federated learning (FL)-enabled DT system consisting of the physical layer and DT layer. With FL, all wireless devices (WDs) can collaborate to update a universal DT model, after the DT server cluster (DSC) aggregates all the local models sent by the WDs with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Moreover, an action model based on the DT system is also updated to optimize the operations of WDs. To increase the energy efficiency, we formulate a problem to minimize the cost of the total energy consumption of the system by optimizing the time allocation of local training, uploading the local models, generating the action model as well as broadcasting the action model and DT model. The numerical results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract={In the heterogeneous vehicular networks (HetVNets), the base stations (BSs) can exploit the massive amounts of valuable data collected by vehicles to complete federated learning tasks. However, most of the existing studies consider the scenario of one task requester (TR) and ignore the fact that multiple TRs may concurrently generate their model training requests in the HetVNets. In this paper, we consider the scenario of multi-TR and multi-BS and propose a digital twin enabled scheme for multitask federated learning to address the two-way selection problem between the TRs and the BSs. We first analyze the diversified requirements of the TRs in the HetVNets. Then, we develop a novel model that jointly considers the available training data, the declared price, and the training experience to evaluate the differentiated training capabilities of the BSs. After that, based on the requirements of the TRs and the training capabilities of the BSs, the two-way selection problem between the TRs and the BSs is formulated as a matching game in the digital twin networks, where a matching algorithm is designed to obtain their optimal strategies. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can obtain the highest model accuracy and bring the highest utility to the TRs compared with the conventional schemes.},

  abstract={The human digital twin (HDT) is a new paradigm that possesses the ability to revolutionize the current healthcare systems. With HDT, ensuring an efficient connectivity scheme between each human-virtual twin pair remains a significant problem. As the concept of HDT is new, conventional connectivity schemes cannot meet the unique requirements of HDT in terms of reliability, security and privacy. This paper thus proposes an edge-assisted connectivity scheme for HDT and adopts an integrated blockchain and federated learning techniques to ensure security and privacy. To minimize long-term average connectivity cost, we formulated the connectivity problem as a Markov decision process and adopted the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to learn the optimal connectivity policy in terms of connectivity cost. The obtained results were then compared with the conventional deep Q-network-based solution. The results show that the proposed DDPG-based connectivity solution is feasible to perform the connectivity process better by optimally allocating system resources, thus reducing the overall connectivity cost, while ensuring data security and privacy.},

  abstract={Incremental learning methods can learn new classes continually by distilling knowledge from the last model (as a teacher model) to the current model (as a student model) in the sequentially learning process. However, these methods cannot work for Incremental Implicitly-Refined Classification (IIRC), an incremental learning extension where the incoming classes could have two granularity levels, a superclass label and a subclass label. This is because the previously learned superclass knowledge may be occupied by the sub-class knowledge learned sequentially. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation (MTKD) strategy. To preserve the subclass knowledge, we use the last model as a general teacher to distill the previous knowledge for the student model. To preserve the superclass knowledge, we use the initial model as a superclass teacher to distill the superclass knowledge as the initial model contains abundant superclass knowledge. However, distilling knowledge from two teacher models could result in the student model making some redundant predictions. We further propose a post-processing mechanism, called as Top-k prediction restriction to reduce the redundant predictions. Our experimental results on IIRC-ImageNet120 and IIRC-CIFAR100 show that the proposed method can achieve better classification accuracy compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Although teleconsultation and robot-based remote teleoperation in ultrasonography have facilitated reliable image acquisition, lack of training still seriously affects the accuracy of ultrasound diagnosis. In order to improve physicians’ scanning skills, a more efficient training process is needed. However, present ultrasound training methods, such as the training phantom, are too costly for individual training. To explore new methods for training, the combined use of vision-based location tracking, motion sensing, and virtual ultrasound generation methods was studied in this work to offer a more low-cost and intuitive interaction system for virtual ultrasound scanning. The feasibility of the proposed workflow was verified by a user study on simple tasks and a clinical evaluation on a virtual ultrasound examination of three fetal heart specimens. As a result, the proposed interaction device facilitated virtual ultrasound examination by making it more efficient and intuitive, according to objective and subjective measurements. Therefore, while virtual ultrasound provides great data extensibility, the proposed device provides a smooth interaction, making the system simple and cost-effective for the end user. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method could provide a promising education system for the trainee to understand standard views of echocardiography and the corresponding anatomical correlations.},

  abstract={Condition monitoring of manufacturing processes plays a vital role in the era of Industry 4.0 and sustainable development goals. The use of condition monitoring enables soft sensing of indirectly measurable or non-measurable production indicators, e.g., cutting forces, as the foundation for a digital shadow or digital twin powered by emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing techniques. Hence, when properly applied, it leads to an improvement in process understanding, production planning, quality control, and predictive maintenance. Despite these merits, the adaptability and reliability of condition monitoring at the production field level are limited by the modeling uncertainties due to the rapidly changing industrial environment driven by dynamic customer demands. This study presents a novel strategy to overcome these shortcomings by employing machine internal signals and prior knowledge-embedded machine learning techniques. A concept of incorporating production domain-specific physical models and logical rules into generalized data-driven methods is proposed. A hybrid learning force model based on machine internal signals was constructed. As a result, the soft sensor encompasses stochastic effects that are neglected in the existing model and estimates the reliability of the modeled findings. Prospectively, this allows for online parametrization of the model within dynamically changing conditions. This concept is exemplarily implemented in an industrial use case.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of intelligent devices in wireless communication, the fifth generation (5G) mobile networks have limited high data rates, low latency, high avail-ability demands. The sixth-generation (6G) mobile network can use Digital-twin (DT) techniques to meet these demands. DT is the virtual representation of physical aspects such as 6G edge nodes. DT optimize the 6G edge nodes parameters using artificial intelligence (AI) and especially machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, AI and ML bring along privacy and security concerns. Therefore, user data must be protected from unauthorized persons during the 6G edge network recovery and expansion phases. In this paper, we proposed a new reliable Digital Twin-based 6G edge network recovery framework using Blockchain technology. We applied the Transfer Learning (TL) technique to improve our proposed framework’s performance. We ensured data privacy and security using TL and Blockchain.},

  abstract={The present work studies the storage security of edge-fog-cloud computing to improve cloud storage security. The data of an intelligent manufacturing industrial machine is used in the research and pre-processed. Machine manufacturing perception data includes data storage and data transmission. In addition, combined with the perception data of machine manufacturing, digital twins technology is used to construct the digital twin in the real world to simulate the online data-driven behavior of machine manufacturing. The digital twins model is built and saved by 3Dmax. Finally, deep learning technology is introduced to defend against network intrusion. Cloud databases are vulnerable to external attacks and internal attacks of cloud data providers. Thus, the homomorphic encryption algorithm and secure multi-party computing are introduced to ensure that the database stores ciphertext data and performs data queries directly. The experimental results indicate that digital twins technology has a good effect. The two-layer cloud database model costs US$11, 476.1, the lowest among comparative models. The unencrypted Amazon Relational Database Service has the best performance. The model proposed here also achieves relatively high availability, and the hybrid cloud structure significantly improves the model's performance. The research content provides a reference for realizing data storage security in a hybrid cloud.},

  abstract={This paper deals with the simulation of production lines focusing on opportunities of reducing the energy consumption. The simulation of systems is one of the pillars of the so-called Industry 4.0. It has been used a digital manufacturing software, which allow the creation of digital twins, to carry out the models. Once the model has been created and validated, a machine learning approach, more specifically a Neural Network was trained to estimate the energy consumption of the line. The estimation of the energy consumption allows to use this variable to take decisions of the production scheduling. Moreover, the neural network package is embedded into the digital manufacturing software which provides more flexibility to solve the problem using one single software tool. The results validate the proposal, and, for future work, the effective creation of the digital twin should be performed.},

The challenges in the ecosystem of mobile applications are related to features particular student learning, so there is a shortage of investigations in this regard. The objective of this study is to understand how characteristics of users can be used to adapt the content of an educational mobile application based on models.

  volume={},

  pages={368-374},
  abstract={Medical image segmentation plays an important role in medical diagnosis and treatment. However, medical image data are more expensive and time-consuming to obtain than ordinary image data. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised method named CAU for medical image segmentation, which can easily use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to segment 2D images. The network learns through a combination of common supervision losses for labeled data and losses for unlabeled data. Specifically, we augment the unlabeled data strongly and weakly and send them to the student model and the teacher model respectively. We take full advantage of unlabeled data learning through a novel combination of minimizing the difference between network predictions for different data augmentation processing scenarios and using an unsupervised loss of min-entropy on the outputs of the two networks. In order to improve the regularization effect, we use the teacher-student model to optimize the teacher model by averaging the student model weights. Experiments show that our method in labeled data experiments with 5%, 10%,35% and 50% labeled data on Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challeng(ACDC) dataset exceeds the fully supervised algorithm using the same amount of data and the existing popular semi-supervised learning algorithms 1.922% ~ 4.451%(Dice),0.841 ~ 5.031(Asd) and 0.06 ~ 1.116(HD95), respectively, and the Dice index exceeds the fully supervised algorithm 0.019% with 50% labeled data, which verifies its effectiveness in medical image segmentation.},

  abstract={The increasingly complex network architecture and numerous emerging network services make it difficult for traditional “best effort” consumer Internet to support current Production Internet/5G requirements for differentiated SLA commitments, low latency, and deterministic bandwidth. To solve various difficulties and challenges faced by the development of ultra-large-scale networks, the Digital Twin Network has become a research hotspot. In this paper, based on the traffic modeling problem involved in the digital twin layer of digital twin network architecture, we proposed an intelligent awareness method for delay-sensitive network traffic. Through the real-time awareness of delay-sensitive traffic, intelligent routing of network services is realized and meets the requirements of scenarios, such as high-value traffic assurance and intelligence traffic scheduling and grooming for network congestion. We experimentally confirmed the scheme by traffic data collected in realistic network environments, and it has an awareness accuracy of more than 90%.},

  year={2022},
  volume={3},
  number={},
  pages={1578-1591},
  abstract={Knowledge of channel state information (CSI) is fundamental to many functionalities for mobile communication systems. With the advance of machine learning (ML) and digital maps, i.e., digital twins, we have a big opportunity to learn the propagation environment and design novel methods to derive and report CSI. In this work, we propose to combine untrained neural networks (UNNs) and conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) for MIMO channel recreation based on prior knowledge. The UNNs learn the prior-CSI for some locations which are used to build the input to a cGAN. Based on the prior-CSI estimates, their locations and the location of the desired channel, the cGAN is trained to output the channel expected at the desired location. This combined approach can be used for low overhead CSI reporting as, after training, we only need to report the desired location. Our results show that our CSI recreation method is successful in modelling the wireless channel under different configurations of prior-CSI spatial sampling. In addition, the results consider a real world measurement campaign for indoor line of sight and non-line of sight channels. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) achieved by our CSI recreation is better than the SNR reported by the measured campaign providers. Moreover, our CSI recreation provides means for low overhead CSI reporting as the UNN structure is underparameterized compared to the full explicit CSI, and only the desired location is needed for the cGAN to recreate the desired CSI.},

  abstract={Digital mymargin Twin (DT) and Intelligent Reflective Surface (IRS), the most two promising technologies of 6G make the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) more adaptive. However, future autonomous driving needs powerful networking resources and high-quality wireless communications to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS). Especially considering the time-varying physical operating environments of IoV, it is extremely urgent to improve resource utilization and wireless channel quality. In this work, we propose a Digital Twin-Driven Vehicular Task Offloading and IRS Configuration Framework (DTVIF) to efficiently monitor, learn, and manage the IoV. Specifically, we adopt Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and IRS to provide augmented computing capacities for vehicles and improve transmission performance when vehicles communicate to MEC servers. DT is employed to achieve real-time data collection and digital representation of physical operating environments of IoV to better support decisions making. In order to reduce the overall delay and energy consumption of DTVIF, we propose a Two-Stage Optimization for Jointly Optimizing Task Offloading and IRS Configuration (TSJTI) algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Transfer Learning (TFL). In the first stage, we introduce Double Deep  $Q$ -learning Networks (DDQN) to find the optimal offloading decision. In the second stage, based on the parameters learned from the first stage, we migrate the parameters from the first stage to find the optimal IRS configuration based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the processing latency of task offloading and reduce the average energy consumption in DTVIF.},

  pages={1-12},
  abstract={More than 60 waste incineration plants (WIPs) are active across Germany. WIPs have various levels of automation, but they still rely on manual operations by human operators. Human operators tend to rely on a few operational levers and infrequent interventions to manage the complex combustion process. Consequently, the combustion process is managed rather inefficiently, and steam outputs and emission levels are not optimal. This article investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) can help enhance process automation and, thus, optimize the combustion process, e.g., by making more frequent and diverse interventions. An RL agent is trained via trial and error with a reward function that includes the optimization criteria. Since the actual equipment, i.e., the real WIP, cannot be used as the training environment, a digital twin is built using original plant data and a neural network. The RL agent is then trained in this offline environment with the deep Q-network algorithm. First, our work demonstrates that a digital twin of a WIP can be built in a data-driven way. Second, we show that the RL agent outperforms the human operator. Thus, the application of RL might benefit the plant operator in financial terms and the environment in terms of reduced emission levels.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology surrounded by many promises, and potentials to reshape the future of industries and society overall. A DT is a system-of-systems which goes far beyond the traditional computer-based simulations and analysis. It is a replication of all the elements, processes, dynamics, and firmware of a physical system into a digital counterpart. The two systems (physical and digital) exist side by side, sharing all the inputs and operations using real-time data communications and information transfer. With the incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3D models, next generation mobile communications (5G/6G), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), distributed computing, Transfer Learning (TL), and electronic sensors, the digital/virtual counterpart of the real-world system is able to provide seamless monitoring, analysis, evaluation and predictions. The DT offers a platform for the testing and analysing of complex systems, which would be impossible in traditional simulations and modular evaluations. However, the development of this technology faces many challenges including the complexities in effective communication and data accumulation, data unavailability to train Machine Learning (ML) models, lack of processing power to support high fidelity twins, the high need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and the absence of standardized development methodologies and validation measures. Being in the early stages of development, DTs lack sufficient documentation. In this context, this survey paper aims to cover the important aspects in realization of the technology. The key enabling technologies, challenges and prospects of DTs are highlighted. The paper provides a deep insight into the technology, lists design goals and objectives, highlights design challenges and limitations across industries, discusses research and commercial developments, provides its applications and use cases, offers case studies in industry, infrastructure and healthcare, lists main service providers and stakeholders, and covers developments to date, as well as viable research dimensions for future developments in DTs.},

  abstract={In this paper, an ill-posed problem of multiple adverse weather removal is investigated. Our goal is to train a model with a ‘unified’ architecture and only one set of pretrained weights that can tackle multiple types of adverse weathers such as haze, snow, and rain simultaneously. To this end, a two-stage knowledge learning mechanism including knowledge collation (KC) and knowledge examination (KE) based on a multi-teacher and student architecture is proposed. At the KC, the student network aims to learn the comprehensive bad weather removal problem from multiple well-trained teacher networks where each of them is specialized in a specific bad weather removal problem. To accomplish this process, a novel collaborative knowledge transfer is proposed. At the KE, the student model is trained without the teacher networks and examined by challenging pixel loss derived by the ground truth. Moreover, to improve the performance of our training framework, a novel loss function called multi-contrastive knowledge regularization (MCR) loss is proposed. Experiments on several datasets show that our student model can achieve promising results on different bad weather removal tasks simultaneously. The code is available in our project page.},

  pages={7571-7580},
  abstract={We address the task of domain adaptation in object detection, where there is an obvious domain gap between a domain with annotations (source) and a domain of interest without annotations (target). As a popular semi-supervised learning method, the teacher-student framework (a student model is supervised by the pseudo labels from a teacher model) has also yielded a large accuracy gain in cross-domain object detection. However, it suffers from the domain shift and generates many low-quality pseudo labels (e.g., false positives), which leads to sub-optimal performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose a teacher-student framework named Adaptive Teacher (AT) which leverages domain adversarial learning and weak-strong data augmentation to address the domain gap. Specifically, we employ feature-level adversarial training in the student model, allowing features derived from the source and target domains to share similar distributions. This process ensures the student model produces domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we apply weak-strong augmentation and mutual learning between the teacher model (taking data from the target domain) and the student model (taking data from both domains). This enables the teacher model to learn the knowledge from the student model without being biased to the source domain. We show that AT demonstrates superiority over existing approaches and even Oracle (fully-supervised) models by a large margin. For example, we achieve 50.9% (49.3%) mAP on Foggy Cityscape (Cli-part1K), which is 9.2% (5.2%) and 8.2% (11.0%) higher than previous state-of-the-art and Oracle, respectively.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation aims to compress a powerful yet cumbersome teacher model into a lightweight student model without much sacrifice of performance. For this purpose, various approaches have been proposed over the past few years, generally with elaborately designed knowledge rep-resentations, which in turn increase the difficulty of model development and interpretation. In contrast, we empirically show that a simple knowledge distillation technique is enough to significantly narrow down the teacher-student performance gap. We directly reuse the discriminative classifier from the pre-trained teacher model for student inference and train a student encoder through feature alignment with a single ℓ2 loss. In this way, the student model is able to achieve exactly the same performance as the teacher model provided that their extracted features are perfectly aligned. An additional projector is developed to help the student encoder match with the teacher classifier, which renders our technique applicable to various teacher and student architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art results at the modest cost of compression ratio due to the added projector.},

  pages={8469-8478},
  abstract={This article addresses the problem of distilling knowledge from a large teacher model to a slim student network for LiDAR semantic segmentation. Directly employing previous distillation approaches yields inferior results due to the intrinsic challenges of point cloud, i.e., sparsity, randomness and varying density. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we propose the Point-to-Voxel Knowledge Distillation (PVD), which transfers the hidden knowledge from both point level and voxel level. Specifically, we first leverage both the pointwise and voxelwise output distillation to complement the sparse supervision signals. Then, to better exploit the structural information, we divide the whole point cloud into several supervoxels and design a difficulty-aware sampling strategy to more frequently sample supervoxels containing less-frequent classes and faraway objects. On these supervoxels, we propose inter-point and inter-voxel affinity distillation, where the similarity information between points and voxels can help the student model better capture the structural information of the surrounding environment. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular LiDAR segmentation benchmarks, i.e., nuScenes [3] and SemanticKITTI [1]. On both benchmarks, our PVD-consistently outperforms previous distillation approaches by a large margin on three representative backbones, i.e., Cylinder3D [36], [37], SPVNAS [25] and MinkowskiNet [5]. Notably, on the challenging nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets, our method can achieve roughly 75% MACs reduction and 2× speedup on the competitive Cylinder3D model and rank 1st on the SemanticKITTI leaderboard among all published algorithms11https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20331#results (single-scan competition) till 2021-11-18 04:00 Pacific Time, and our method is termed Point-Voxel-KD.

  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={7010-7021},
  abstract={Open-vocabulary instance segmentation aims at segmenting novel classes without mask annotations. It is an important step toward reducing laborious human supervision. Most existing works first pretrain a model on captioned images covering many novel classes and then finetune it on limited base classes with mask annotations. However, the high-level textual information learned from caption pretraining alone cannot effectively encode the details required for pixelwise segmentation. To address this, we propose a cross-modal pseudo-labeling framework, which generates training pseudo masks by aligning word semantics in captions with visual features of object masks in images. Thus, our framework is capable of labeling novel classes in captions via their word semantics to self-train a student model. To account for noises in pseudo masks, we design a robust student model that selectively distills mask knowledge by estimating the mask noise levels, hence mitigating the adverse impact of noisy pseudo masks. By extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of our framework, where we significantly improve mAP score by 4.5% on MS-COCO and 5.1 % on the large-scale Open Images & Conceptual Captions datasets compared to the state-of-the-art.11Code is available at https://github.com/hbdat/cvpr22_cross_modal_pseudo_labeling.},

  abstract={Semi-supervised object detection has made significant progress with the development of mean teacher driven self-training. Despite the promising results, the label mismatch problem is not yet fully explored in the previous works, leading to severe confirmation bias during self-training. In this paper, we delve into this problem and propose a simple yet effective LabelMatch framework from two different yet complementary perspectives, i.e., distribution-level and instance-level. For the former one, it is reasonable to approximate the class distribution of the unlabeled data from that of the labeled data according to Monte Carlo Sampling. Guided by this weakly supervision cue, we introduce a re-distribution mean teacher, which leverages adaptive label-distribution-aware confidence thresholds to generate unbiased pseudo labels to drive student learning. For the latter one, there exists an overlooked label assignment ambiguity problem across teacher-student models. To remedy this issue, we present a novel label assignment mechanism for self-training framework, namely proposal self-assignment, which injects the proposals from student into teacher and generates accurate pseudo labels to match each proposal in the student model accordingly. Experiments on both MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC datasets demonstrate the considerable superiority of our proposed framework to other state-of-the-arts.

  abstract={Prototypical methods have recently gained a lot of attention due to their intrinsic interpretable nature, which is obtained through the prototypes. With growing use cases of model reuse and distillation, there is a need to also study transfer of interpretability from one model to another. We present Proto2Proto, a novel method to transfer interpretability of one prototypical part network to another via knowledge distillation. Our approach aims to add interpretability to the “dark” knowledge transferred from the teacher to the shallower student model. We propose two novel losses: “Global Explanation” loss and “Patch-Prototype Correspondence” loss to facilitate such a transfer. Global Explanation loss forces the student prototypes to be close to teacher prototypes, and Patch-Prototype Cor-respondence loss enforces the local representations of the student to be similar to that of the teacher. Further, we propose three novel metrics to evaluate the student's proximity to the teacher as measures of interpretability transfer in our settings. We qualitatively and quantitatively demon-strate the effectiveness of our method on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets. Our experiments show that the proposed method indeed achieves interpretability transfer from teacher to student while simultaneously exhibiting competitive performance.

  pages={908-917},
  abstract={Fusion of multiple sensor modalities such as camera, Lidar, and Radar, which are commonly found on autonomous vehicles, not only allows for accurate detection but also robustifies perception against adverse weather conditions and individual sensor failures. Due to inherent sensor characteristics, Radar performs well under extreme weather conditions (snow, rain, fog) that significantly degrade camera and Lidar. Recently, a few works have developed vehicle detection methods fusing Lidar and Radar signals, i.e., MVD-Net. However, these models are typically developed under the assumption that the models always have access to two error-free sensor streams. If one of the sensors is unavailable or missing, the model may fail catastrophically. To mitigate this problem, we propose the Self-Training Multimodal Vehicle Detection Network (ST-MVDNet) which leverages a Teacher-Student mutual learning framework and a simulated sensor noise model used in strong data augmentation for Lidar and Radar. We show that by (1) enforcing output consistency between a Teacher network and a Student network and by (2) introducing missing modalities (strong augmentations) during training, our learned model breaks away from the error-free sensor assumption. This consistency enforcement enables the Student model to handle missing data properly and improve the Teacher model by updating it with the Student model's exponential moving average. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed learning framework for multi-modal detection is able to better handle missing sensor data during inference. Furthermore, our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance (5% gain) on the Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset under various evaluation settings.},

  abstract={Traditional knowledge distillation adopts a two-stage training process in which a teacher model is pre-trained and then transfers the knowledge to a compact student model. To overcome the limitation, online knowledge distillation is proposed to perform one-stage distillation when the teacher is unavailable. Recent researches on online knowledge distillation mainly focus on the design of the distillation objective, including attention or gate mechanism. Instead, in this work, we focus on the design of the global architecture and propose Tree-Structured Auxiliary online knowledge distillation (TSA), which adds more parallel peers for layers close to the output hierarchically to strengthen the effect of knowledge distillation. Different branches construct different views of the inputs, which can be the source of the knowledge. The hierarchical structure implies that the knowledge transfers from general to task-specific with the growth of the layers. Extensive experiments on 3 computer vision and 4 natural language processing datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without bells and whistles. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of online knowledge distillation for machine translation tasks.11Code is available at https://github.com/Linwenye/Tree-Supervised.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation is a technique that effectively trains a lightweight model with strong generalization ability under the supervision of a powerful teacher model. However, a well-trained teacher model is really time-consuming. Therefore, online knowledge distillation emerged, which uses the aggregated results of multiple student models to help each student model to converge. But existing online distillation methods have several drawbacks, such as unavailable teacher models and the lack of diversity among student models. These hinder the further improvement of network performance. In this work, we propose a new online knowledge distillation technique that trains diverse architecture auxiliary peers to enhance the final effect of knowledge distillation. We propose a Multi-Architecture Peers (MAP) mechanism, which enhances student models to learn diverse features and delivers a powerful ensemble result. Furthermore, we introduce a Feature Learning Module (FLM) that efficiently learns rich semantic information by combing feature maps generated from the last block of student models and generates precise weights for each student model. The experimental results on three image classification datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN show that our method trains diverse student models and achieves much better results than alternative methods.},

  abstract={Predicting gait trajectories from electroencephalography (EEG) is useful for lower limb rehabilitation. The temporal dynamics of EEG pertaining to individual subjects while they are walking require a personalized treatment inside the deep neural network. Also, the EEG data collected from different sessions or days may exhibit varied distributions, further hindering the model generality. Therefore, we propose the Multi-model ATtention Network (MATN) to address these issues. MATN exploits the self-attention mechanism on the spatio-temporal EEG encoding to learn the subject-specific temporal dynamics. To adapt to varied data distributions, MATN employs knowledge distillation, which includes a teacher and student model. The latter is supervised by the intermediate feature maps from the trained teacher and the labels. Experiments of the regression of bilateral joint angles on the legs (hip, knee, and ankle) are carried out using the MoBI dataset in a subject-specific manner. Our MATN achieves more than 18% improvement on the Pearson's correlation coefficient compared to five other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Super-resolution (SR) methods are used to reconstruct details in images to obtain an improved resolution. Recently, SR methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become seminal due to their effectiveness in generating textures. However, a common problem is the presence of unpleasant artifacts. In this paper, an edge-guided SR neural network (Edge-SRN) is proposed by introducing a plug-in edge detection module and incorporating a new edge loss, which increases the reconstruction accuracy and reduces artifacts. We also use the Edge-SRN as a teacher network to a knowledge distillation framework for training a lightweight student SR model. The student model learned from Edge-SRN outperforms its counterparts learned from GAN-based teachers or from the ground-truth HR images in both reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality, which indicates the ability of reconstructing realistic textures can be transferred well from Edge-SRN to a small model. Extensive experiments on diverse criteria show the promising performance of our method compared with several state-of-the-art SR methods in the qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

  abstract={In this paper, we design a resource management scheme to support stateful applications, which will be prevalent in sixth generation (6G) networks. Different from stateless applications, stateful applications require context data while executing computing tasks from user terminals (UTs). Using a multi-tier computing paradigm with servers deployed at the core network, gateways, and base stations to support stateful applications, we aim to optimize long-term resource reservation by jointly minimizing the usage of computing, storage, and communication resources and the cost of reconfiguring resource reservation. The coupling among different resources and the impact of UT mobility create challenges in resource management. To address the challenges, we develop digital twin (DT) empowered network planning with two elements, i.e., multi-resource reservation and resource reservation reconfiguration. First, DTs are designed for collecting UT status data, based on which UTs are grouped according to their mobility patterns. Second, an algorithm is proposed to customize resource reservation for different groups to satisfy their different resource demands. Last, a Meta-learning-based approach is developed to reconfigure resource reservation for balancing the network resource usage and the reconfiguration cost. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DT-empowered network planning outperforms benchmark frameworks by using less resources and incurring lower reconfiguration costs.},

This paper presents an application of digital twin modeling for a data center in an academic institute. The building information modeling (BIM) has been applied to represent the data center.

  abstract={Current sewage pipeline inspection researches focus on locating defects, with only a few studies addressing the crack fine-grained classification task. However, in engineering applications, such as Pipeline Assessment Certification Program (PACP), subcategory coding of cacks is required. Therefore, this paper studies the fine-grained classification of pipeline cracks. Algorithms based on deep learning have been widely used in the field of sewage pipeline inspection, but these models have a large number of parameters and are computationally time-consuming. Edge or embedded devices with weak GPUs cannot accept the time and storage costs of these large models. To solve the above problems, this paper introduces knowledge distillation (KD) which is one of the mainstream model compression methods. We select the large-scale network Resnet50 as the teacher model and design a lightweight network Combined MobileNetV2 & Inception (CMI) for crack detection as the student model. High-temperature distillation allows the student model to obtain dark knowledge from the pre-trained, well-performing teacher model, which is combined with ground truth (GT) for training. Experiments show that KD is effective. By adjusting the KD hyperparameters, the classification accuracy of the student model is improved by 1.41%, and the F1-score is improved by 1.12%. This demonstrates the robustness of knowledge distillation to improve the performance of small models, laying the foundation for future deployment on multi-sensor automatic detection robots.},

  abstract={Reinforced concrete buildings have proven the need to monitor the concrete and steel parts over time. The topic of structural monitoring of a building is becoming more topical with time, and many buildings from the 1960s and 1970s are under observation. The current challenge is to monitor structures effectively and continuously, applying the meaning of preventive maintenance, a concept well developed in engineering disciplines. New technologies allow us to assess the impact of time, wear, and tear, which in the long term can challenge the safety of buildings by monitoring the natural vibrations of a building. However, traditional monitoring systems in the civil infrastructure sector have always been expensive and undervalued. Therefore, borrowing innovations from computer science, a sensor system based on the new paradigms of the Internet of Things (IoT) was developed to provide a valuable alternative to proven vibration monitoring systems. The proposed system consists of a microprocessor (Raspberry Pi) and a low-cost accelerometer for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), this type of lower costs sensor allows for investment in the safety of structures. The architecture of the monitoring system and the visualization of the vibrational model and its operation mechanism are presented. The performance of the monitoring system and the data collected are then integrated with Deep Learning techniques to obtain possible future scenarios and forecasts practically to perform tests that are as close as possible to reality and thus be able to act with the necessary maintenance to prevent undesired structural effects.},

  abstract={The lightweight model has played an important role in the remote sensing (RS) realm. The existing researchers have proposed many models with lightweight structures, but their performance still has a gap compared with the deep model. A promising approach to optimize the lightweight model is knowledge distillation (KD), which can be viewed as knowledge transfer from the teacher model. However, the existing KD approaches have some issues. On one hand, offline distillation methods usually ignore the interactive learning between the student model and the teacher model. On the other hand, knowledge transfer does not consider instance property. This offline distillation strategy without property perception may not suitable for multiscale, diverse, and complex RS instances and results in a suboptimum training status. In this article, we propose a dynamic interactive learning (DIL) framework for optimizing RS lightweight detectors. First, we propose an instance interaction learning module. It calculates the value of every instance in the batch of the teacher and student prediction by each model’s real-time state and instance property. Then according to the DIL thought, we facilitate the low-quality instance to learn from the high-quality one whether it is from the teacher or student model. Moreover, we also propose the instance property perception (IPP) strategy that weighs the distillation knowledge of instances according to their feature, category, and location property. In the proposed DIL framework, both the teacher and student models are trained together and it is cost-free in the testing phase. Extensive experiments on three RS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the DIL.},

  abstract={We propose a non-iterative method to optimize pseudo-labeling thresholds for learning object detection from a collection of low-cost datasets, each of which is annotated for only a subset of all the object classes. A popular approach to this problem is first to train teacher models and then to use their confident predictions as pseudo ground-truth labels when training a student model. To obtain the best result, however, thresholds for prediction confidence must be adjusted. This process typically involves iterative search and repeated training of student models and is time-consuming. Therefore, we develop a method to optimize the thresholds without iterative optimization by maximizing the Fβ-score on a validation dataset, which measures the quality of pseudo labels and can be measured without training a student model. We experimentally demonstrate that our proposed method achieves an mAP comparable to that of grid search on the COCO and VOC datasets.},

  title={Pyramid Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Human Pose Estimation},

  abstract={Human pose estimation is an important task in many real-time applications. Existing methods directly slim the CNN by deploying well-designed lightweight modules. However, these methods lack privileged information guidance and the knowledge distillation technique stays less explored. In this work, we propose a novel method, namely Pyramid Knowledge Distillation (PKD) for efficient human pose estimation. Specifically, PKD composes of Pyramid Structured Map Distillation (PSMD) and Pyramid Feature Map Distillation (PFMD). In PSMD, we formulate a structured map encoding robust interjoint correlation. Based on structured map, the spatial dependencies between keypoints can be better transferred from a cumbersome teacher network to a compact student model. To further promote the efficiency of student, PFMD is used to distill rich local and global features from teacher. Experiments demonstrate that PKD achieves an optimal trade-off between cost and accuracy on COCO and MPII benchmarks, even with a much faster inference speed.},

  title={Towards Generalizable DEEPFAKE Face Forgery Detection with Semi-Supervised Learning and Knowledge Distillation}, 
  year={2022},

  number={},
  pages={576-580},
  abstract={Existing methods for deepfake face forgery detection have already achieved tremendous progress in well-controlled laboratory conditions. However, under wild scenarios where the training and testing forgeries are synthesized by different algorithms and when labeled data are insufficient, the performance always drops greatly. In this work, we present a Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning and Knowledge Distillation-based framework (SCL-KD) for deepfake detection to reduce the aforementioned performance gap. Our proposed framework contains three stages: self-supervised pre-training, supervised training, and knowledge distillation. Specifically, a feature encoder is firstly trained in a self-supervised manner with a large number of unlabeled samples through a momentum contrastive mechanism. Secondly, a fully-connected classifier on top of the feature encoder is trained in a supervised manner with a small amount of labeled samples to build a teacher model. Finally, a compact student model is trained with the help of the teacher model using knowledge distillation, in order to avoid overfitting to labeled data and have better generalizability on mismatched datasets. Evaluations on several benchmark datasets corroborate the good performance of our approach in cross-dataset situations and few labeled data scenarios. It reveals the potential of our proposed method for real-world deepfake detection.},
