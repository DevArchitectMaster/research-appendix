  abstract={Making an updated and as-built model plays an important role in the life-cycle of a process plant. In particular, Digital Twin models must be precise to guarantee the efficiency and reliability of the systems. Data-driven models can simulate the latest behavior of the sub-systems by considering uncertainties and life-cycle related changes. This paper presents a step-by-step concept for hybrid Digital Twin models of process plants using an early implemented prototype as an example. It will detail the steps for updating the first-principles model and Digital Twin of a brownfield process system using data-driven models of the process equipment. The challenges for generation of an as-built hybrid Digital Twin will also be discussed. With the help of process history data to teach Machine Learning models, the implemented Digital Twin can be continually improved over time and this work in progress can be further optimized.},

  pages={337-342},
  abstract={Pipelines are used to transport liquids and gases between different places. In recent years, identifying the location and size of cracks in transmission pipes has received much attention. Thus, in this research, the combination of fuzzy digital twin (FDT), support vector machine (SVM), and backstepping (BS) observer is suggested for leak detection and localization. In the first stage, the proposed fuzzy digital twin is introduced. So, first, the flow rate in the healthy condition is modeled using the fuzzy Gaussian process Regression (FGR) which is a combination of Gaussian process Regression (GR) and fuzzy algorithm. After that, in the second stage, the flowrate signals are estimated using the fuzzy digital twin that is a combination of FGR, BS technique, and fuzzy procedure. The proposed FDT is used to modeling and estimated the flow rate in the pipeline in normal and abnormal conditions. Moreover, it can be used for data generation. After modeling and estimated data using FDT, in the next step, the residual data is generated to improve the accuracy of crack localization. Next, the crack is detected by the combination of the SVM and FDT. To find the location of the crack, the combination of FDT and the backstepping algorithm is suggested. The Ulsan Industrial Artificial Intelligence (VIAl) Lab dataset is used to test the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The results show that the proposed FDT is 25% improved in the accuracy for fault localization compared with the classical digital twin.},

  abstract={Perceptual audio quality assessment is a task that involves the characterization and estimation of perceived quality of an audio signal. Many existing systems, depending on psychoacoustic principles and statistical models, achieve reasonable performance under specific conditions (e.g., type of artifacts, impairment levels, etc.) but do not generalize well when these conditions vary. This lack of generality often limits their utility in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by leveraging the domain knowledge from several state-of-the-art expert systems. Particularly, we explore the idea of training a multitask student model using unlabeled data and the pseudo labels from multiple expert (i.e. teacher) systems. Evaluation is conducted using a variety of test datasets, and the results show that our proposed system compares favorably with the state-of-the-art systems and achieves the highest overall performance.},

  abstract={The energy efficiency of the metallurgy is becoming more and more important today due to the permanently growing requirements to the final product quality. One of the modern methods to increase it is the production digitalization, which is mostly based on the concept of “Digital Twins” or “Digital Shadows” of technologically processes or units. As far as the metallurgy is concerned, the units with the highest energy consumption are furnaces. This fact makes it actual to try to develop “Digital Twins” of such furnaces. One of the main constituent parts of the “Digital Twin” is a kind of a mathematical model, such as finite-difference or data-based ones. In this research: 1) the finite-difference model of the steel heating process, which is based on the differential equation of transient heat conduction, is developed; 2) the obtained finite-difference model is compared with the data-based one, which is obtained as a result of application of the machine learning algorithms and extreme gradient boosting method modification (DART) to the data obtained from the furnace; 3) conclusions are made on the advantages and disadvantages of these models. The data-based model error is 7.4 degrees Celsius lower than the one obtained with the help of the finite-difference model.},

  pages={176-180},
  abstract={In realistic speech enhancement settings for end-user devices, we often encounter only a few speakers and noise types that tend to reoccur in the specific acoustic environment. We propose a novel personalized speech enhancement method to adapt a compact denoising model to the test-time specificity. Our goal in this test-time adaptation is to utilize no clean speech target of the test speaker, thus fulfilling the requirement for zero-shot learning. To complement the lack of clean speech, we employ the knowledge distillation framework: we distill the more advanced denoising results from an overly large teacher model, and use them as the pseudo target to train the small student model. This zero-shot learning procedure circumvents the process of collecting users' clean speech, a process that users are reluctant to comply due to privacy concerns and technical difficulty of recording clean voice. Experiments on various test-time conditions show that the proposed personalization method can significantly improve the compact models' performance during the test time. Furthermore, since the personalized models outperform larger non-personalized baseline models, we claim that personalization achieves model compression with no loss of denoising performance. As expected, the student models underperform the state-of-the-art teacher models.},

DES are becoming steadfastly integrated into their corresponding physical counterparts to administer greater avenues for their analysis, control, forecasts and optimisations in real-time. However, this growth does not materialise without a penalty in the form of computational burden. The demand for flexible and alternate approaches to accelerate DES is made necessary. Hence, the utilisation of GPUs to comply with such acceleration presents a research topic of growing interest. This work investigates the use of the Machine Learning platform TensorFlow with GPUs to accelerate a variety of manufacturing-domain DES using the SimPy simulation framework. A range of results were gathered, of speed-ups spanning between x1.4 and x3.21, paving the way for further enhancements towards the vision of real-time communication between simulation and physical system in the form of a complete Digital Twin.},

  abstract={There is a growing interest in designing robots that can work alongside humans. Such robots will undoubtedly be expected to explain their behavior and decisions. While generating explanations is an actively researched topic, most works tend to focus on methods that generate explanations that are one size fits all. As in the specifics of the user-model are completely ignored. The handful of works that look at tailoring their explanation to the user’s background rely on having specific models of the users (either analytic models or learned labeling models). The goal of this work is thus to propose an end-to-end adaptive explanation generation system that begins by learning the different types of users that the robot could interact with. Then during the interaction with the target user, it is tasked with identifying the type on the fly and adjust its explanations accordingly. The former is achieved by a data-driven clustering approach while for the latter, we compile our explanation generation problem into a POMDP. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system on two domains using state-of-the-art POMDP solvers. We also report the results of a user study that investigates the benefits of providing personalized explanations in a human-robot interaction setting.},

  abstract={Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful mathematical framework that allows robots to learn complex skills by trial-and-error. Despite numerous successes in many applications, RL algorithms still require thousands of trials to converge to high-performing policies, can produce dangerous behaviors while learning, and the optimized policies (usually modeled as neural networks) give almost zero explanation when they fail to perform the task. For these reasons, the adoption of RL in industrial settings is not common. Behavior Trees (BTs), on the other hand, can provide a policy representation that a) supports modular and composable skills, b) allows for easy interpretation of the robot actions, and c) provides an advantageous low-dimensional parameter space. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that can learn the parameters of a BT policy in simulation and then generalize to the physical robot without any additional training. We leverage a physical simulator with a digital twin of our workstation, and optimize the relevant parameters with a black-box optimizer. We showcase the efficacy of our method with a 7-DOF KUKAiiwa manipulator in a task that includes obstacle avoidance and a contact-rich insertion (peg-in-hole), in which our method outperforms the baselines.},

  abstract={Intelligent fault detection is a mechanism’s competency to distinguish between healthy and faulty machine signals for smart and efficient diagnosis. The modelling and analysis of the parameters that contribute to the system’s fundamental operation form the crux of the framework. A heuristic technology to enable real-time intelligent fault detection is digital twin technology. Digital twin technology allows a tandem establishment between real-world machines and the virtual domain, allowing for the inclusion of optimization and maintenance frameworks. Sparsely represented machines in the digital twin domain are linear actuators, which form essential parts of various industrial and commercial machines. Therefore, this study has modelled a data-driven and multi-physics robotic linear actuator digital twin, and integrated it with a custom designed fault detection mechanism using Naïve Bayes classifier. This architecture can autonomously be deployed in tandem to the physical machine to alarm and diagnose electrical faults as soon as they occur in the machine. As compared with conventional diagnostics this will reduce machine down-time and expedite repairs. The resultant model built on MATLAB, Simulink gave an accuracy of 96% and required minimal processing capability to operate. Widespread commercial utilization of the proposed model can pave the path for Industry 4.0 utilization of linear actuators as well as technologies including industrial robots that utilize them.},

  abstract={The typical optimization and control activities of Digital Twins are driven by high-performance simulators. Due to the significant complexity of systems subject to digital twinning, constructing simulators of appropriate details is a costly and error-prone endeavor. To alleviate these problems, we propose an approach for inferring simulation models of Digital Twins by machine learning. Instead of learning the simulation model of one specific simulator, we aim at learning their construction process. This generality enables reusing the inferred knowledge in different (but congruent) Digital Twin settings. To achieve this level of generality, we propose the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism for capturing simulation models; and reinforcement learning (RL) for inferring DEVS models. In this paper, we explore the opportunities and challenges in combining these two techniques.},

  abstract={This Research Full Paper presents a systematic review on knowledge tracing of learning programming based on student performance data in exercises. Programming has become an essential skill to solve realworld problems in modern engineering disciplines. However, when students start to learn how to program, they face a lot of challenges in acquiring various programming knowledge and skills. While it is beneficial to customise learning material to fit individual learning progress, the widely different learning pace of students in an introductory programming course has made it impractical for teachers to track the knowledge acquisition of individual. Hence, many recent works take a data-driven approach to model students' learning progress based on the performance data in programming-related exercises, which include the submitted program codes and answers to closed-ended programming exercises. By analyzing these performance data, a system can evaluate the students' knowledge level of various concepts and skills in programming. This paper performs a systematic review and reports key information about recent works on programming knowledge tracing based on student performance data. An overview of the different choices of knowledge representation, domain knowledge model, performance measure and knowledge tracing algorithms is provided. The nature and granularity of knowledge components and the relationships between them are compared across the reviewed works. The different choice of programming knowledge representation leads to varied methods to assess knowledge levels from empirical performance data in programming-related exercises. Two broad categories of works are identified. The first is to overlay a student model on the domain knowledge model, and the student knowledge levels are updated in distinct time steps. The second trains temporal knowledge tracing models to predict students' future performance based on their performance in previous exercises. In addition, this review discusses the distinct challenges in knowledge tracing in programming education. It also points out limitations in current works and opportunities to improve knowledge tracing in learning programming.},

  abstract={The product companies are going towards Digital Transformation for digital customer experience. This is effective for marketing and sales specially during the pandemic. For the product visualization, it is necessary to create multiple 2D views of a product which is a cumbersome and time-consuming process especially when there are copious number of products. Traditional rendering techniques and image augmentation for dataset generation either take quite a lot of time or do not yield photo-realistic images. The recent progress in generative models and 3D deep learning provide a promising avenue in this regard. This paper explores different techniques for rendering photo-realistic 2D images from 3D CAD models. This study compares the performance of three different models pix2pix, Pytorch3D and SynSin based on three different approaches namely image-to-image translation, mesh rendering, and view synthesis respectively to generate photo-realistic images. The models are tested using the dataset provided by Schneider Electric. Results demonstrate that Pytorch3D is the better model to generate photo-realistic images. These approaches can emerge as the initial steps for digital twin technology.},

Although extensive benefits are recognized, the security risks for using the digital twin have yet to be explored. The physical world of various nodes communicates with the digital twin. The digital twins will also communicate with each other in the near future. This study investigates the risks and threats which target the components of digital twin, machine learning processes, and data communication.

  year={2021},

  number={},
  pages={166-177},
  abstract={The energy consumption footprint of Passive Optical Networks (PONs) is high due to its widespread deployment. Therefore, a large and growing body of literature has investigated how energy consumption in PONs can be minimized. Existing research indicates that sleep mode is an effective means for reducing energy consumption in PONs. There is also a growing number of contributions that demonstrate the importance of integrating PON with Software-defined Networking (SDN). Such integration facilitates a programmable PON, which can dynamically adjust its operation on-the-fly based on the decision made by a SDN controller. The most important limitations in the previous energy-efficient PON research lies in the fact that they failed to address how the energy saving and traffic performance can be fed in real-time into the network operation decision process. Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging field of research in the communication networking area. DT can bridge between real and virtual world making a significant contribution in defining optimal operation of the network. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Digital-twin-assisted Software-defined PON framework in order to feed the network performance data in real-time to the network operation decision support system, which aims at maximizing energy conservation while meeting quality of service, and control PON infrastructure on-the-fly. Our DT based solution also integrates a supervised learning Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method for making traffic arrival forecasts based on time series traffic traces. The initial findings of our research based on a C++ discrete event simulator show that the proposed solution successfully reduces energy consumption while meeting traffic delay requirements in a PON.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Vehicle platooning is one of the advanced driving applications expected to be supported by the 5G vehicle to everything (V2X) communications. It holds great potentials on improving road efficiency, driving safety and fuel efficiency. Apart from the organization and internal communication of the platoons, real-time prediction of surrounding road users (such as vehicles and cyclists) is another critical issue. While artificial intelligence (AI) is receiving increasing interests on its application to trajectory prediction, there is a potential problem that the pre-trained neural network models may not well fit the current driving environment and needs online fine-tuning to maintain an acceptable high prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a digital twin based real-time trajectory prediction scheme for platoons of connected intelligent vehicles. In this scheme the head vehicle of a platoon senses the surrounding vehicles. A LSTM neural network is applied for real-time trajectory prediction with the sensing outcomes. The head vehicle controls the offloading of the trajectory data and maintains a digital twin to optimize the update of LSTM model. In the digital twin a Deep-Q Learning (DQN) algorithm is utilized for adaptive fine tuning of the LSTM model, to ensure the prediction accuracy and minimize the consumption of communication and computing resources. A real-world dataset is developed from the KITTI datasets for simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed trajectory prediction scheme can maintain a prediction accuracy for safe platooning and reduce the delay of updating the neural networks by up to 40%.},

  abstract={Power load forecasting is affected by uncertain factors such as temperature, humidity, light and seasons, and has strong randomness and volatility, so it is difficult to carry out real-time power load forecasting. This paper proposes a digital twin model oriented to power load forecasting based on a simplified long short-term memory network (S-LSTM, Simplify Long Short-Term Memory). For this reason, the proposed digital twin model realizes the synchronization and real-time update of the physical entities of the power system, and obtains more accurate and faster prediction results than traditional prediction methods. The model uses S-LSTM as the core of the digital twin system, trains the S-LSTM model through RMSProp adaptive learning algorithm, constrains the learning rate, obtains the best parameters, and improves the model&#x0027;s adaptability to different types of data. The simulation results show that compared with other prediction methods, it verifies the effectiveness and feasibility of the method proposed in this paper.},

  pages={1533-1538},
  abstract={Advances in modeling and computation have resulted in high-fidelity digital models capable of simulating the dynamics of a wide range of industrial systems. These models often require calibration, or the estimation of an optimal set of parameters, to reflect a system’s observed behavior. While searching over the parameter space is an inevitable part of the calibration process, models are seldom designed to be valid for arbitrarily large parameter spaces. Application of existing black-box calibration methods, therefore, often require repeatedly evaluating a model over a wide range of parameters. For some parameter combinations, the simulations could be unreasonably slow or fail altogether. In general, the shape of subregions in the parameter space that could result in simulation failure is unknown and near-impossible to ascertain analytically. In this paper, we propose a novel failure robust Bayesian optimization (FR-BO) algorithm that learns these failure regions from simulation data and informs a Bayesian optimization algorithm to avoid failure regions while searching for optimal parameters. This results in acceleration of the optimizer’s convergence and prevents wastage of time trying to simulate parameters with high failure probabilities.},

  abstract={Facial landmark detection aims to locate some predefined points on human face images, which is the basis of many facial analysis tasks and applications. Compared with traditional methods, facial landmark detector based on deep learning has made significant progress in accuracy and efficiency. However, the model parameters and computational cost have not received enough attention, leading to the algorithm facing many challenges in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method named efficient facial landmark detector (EFLD), which significantly compresses the model size and computational cost while achieving superior performance compared with state-of-the-art frameworks. We introduce a knowledge distillation framework suitable for facial landmark detection, which can transfer geometric information from the pre-trained teacher model to the lightweight student model. In addition, we integrate adversarial learning into the knowledge distillation framework to guide the student model to imitate the heatmap distribution generated by the teacher model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.},

No matter how smart and powerful an AI model we can build, the ultimate testimony of the success of data science and AI is users’ trust. How can we build trustworthy data science? At the level of user-model interaction, how can we convince users that a data analytic result is trustworthy? At the level of group-wise collaboration for data science and AI, how can we ensure that the parties and their contributions are recognized fairly, and establish trust between the outcome (e.g., a model built) of the group collaboration and the external users? At the level of data science participant eco-systems, how can we effectively and efficiently connect many participants of various roles and facilitate the connection among supplies and demands of data and models? In this talk, I will brainstorm possible directions to the above questions in the context of an endto-end data science pipeline. To strengthen trustworthy interactions between models and users, I will advocate exact and consistent interpretation of machine learning models. Our recent results show that exact and consistent interpretations are not just theoretically feasible, but also practical even for API-based AI services. To build trust in collaboration among multiple participants in coalition, I will review some progress in ensuring fairness in federated learning, including fair assessment of contributions and fairness enforcement in collaboration outcome. Last, to address the need of trustworthy data science eco-systems, I will review some latest efforts in building data and model marketplaces and preserving fairness and privacy. Through reflection I will discuss some challenges and opportunities in building trustworthy data science for possible future work.},

  abstract={Smart Cities will create many benefits for society. One of the most significant will be real-time, active management of the systems making up a Smart City. Active management will be enabled by processing large amounts of real-time data, by machine learning to deliver timely insights and by large-scale simulation to create effective interventions. To realise active management of Smart Cities requires processing systems that can take in data at large volume and variety, and perform complex processing on these data, all in real-time. Digital twins are used to create a continuous, consistent view of the current state of the city, and simulation of the evolution of digitals twins is used to detect problems arising in the near future and to optimise the impact of interventions. In this paper we propose and validate a Smart City processing architecture that can deliver these benefits by building a digital twin of a city, combining real-time streamed data ingestion, simulation and analytics. Streamed data systems can deliver a real time response with large amount of incoming data but are not suited to time advancing simulations where the interaction between modelled objects is important. We propose a processing architecture that mitigates this limitation by separating object interactions from streamed data processing. Finally, we introduce DEDUCE-PT, a demonstration implementation of this Smart City processing architecture that is aimed at proactive management of public transport systems.},

  abstract={Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been considered as a key solution in model compression and acceleration in recent years. In KD, a small student model is generally trained from a large teacher model by minimizing the divergence between the probabilistic outputs of the two. However, as demonstrated in our experiments, existing KD methods might not transfer critical explainable knowledge of the teacher to the student, i.e. the explanations of predictions made by the two models are not consistent. In this paper, we propose a novel explainable knowledge distillation model, called XDistillation, through which both the performance the explanations’ information are transferred from the teacher model to the student model. The XDistillation model leverages the idea of convolutional autoencoders to approximate the teacher explanations. Our experiments shows that models trained by XDistillation outperform those trained by conventional KD methods not only in term of predictive accuracy but also faithfulness to the teacher models.},

  abstract={Although researches on the dialogue system with deep learning methods have achieved good performance, medical dialogue generation confronts particular difficulties against other domains. As requiring highly accurate replies, many different types of external guidance signals are provided in previous studies to control the output and increase faithfulness. However, how these strategies compare and combine to each other is not known. In light of these challenges, we propose a multi-guidance model with bidirectional distillation for medical dialogue generation. Firstly, we fuse different guidance signals (keywords, categories and summaries) with neural sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model as teacher models. Meanwhile, we consider a simplified model without guidance as the student model. We also propose an attention mechanism to ensemble for the fusion of knowledge from multiple teachers. We further develop a bidirectional distillation module to exchange the knowledge between the teachers and a student from both sides during the training process. Through extensive experiments on medical dataset, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over state-of-the-art ones.},

In this study, we propose a novel textual data augmentation method to generate artificial clinical notes in patients’ Electronic Health Records (EHRs) that can be used as additional training data for patient outcomes prediction. Essentially, we fine-tune the generative language model GPT-2 to synthesize labeled text with the original training data. More specifically, We propose a teacher-student framework where we first pre-train a teacher model on the 0riginal data, and then train a student model on the GPT-augmented data under the guidance of the teacher. We evaluate our method on the most common patient outcome, i.e., the 30-day readmission rate. The experimental results show that deep models can improve their predictive performance with the augmented data, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation in machine learning is the process of transferring knowledge from a large model called teacher to a smaller model called student. Knowledge distillation is one of the techniques to compress the large network (teacher) to a smaller network (student) that can be deployed in small devices such as mobile phones. When the network size gap between the teacher and student increases, the performance of the student network decreases. To solve this problem, an intermediate model is employed between the teacher model and the student model known as the teaching assistant model, which in turn bridges the gap between the teacher and the student. In this research, we have shown that using multiple teaching assistant models, the student model (the smaller model) can be further improved. We combined these multiple teaching assistant model using weighted ensemble learning where we have used a differential evaluation optimization algorithm to generate the weight values.},

  abstract={Machine comprehension of text is a critical problem in natural language processing (NLP). However, there are severe data imbalance problems in extractive machine reading comprehension (MRC) tasks: unbalanced data will lead to differences between training and testing. Without a balanced label, the learning process tends to meet to a point, strongly biasing towards the class and the majority of labels. The most used cross-entropy criteria are accuracy-oriented, mainly focusing on the majority class to achieve high accuracy. Another problem is that the training of the model only introduces correct knowledge, which is not accurate enough for answer prediction. To address these issues, we propose to use focal loss in replacement of the standard cross-entropy objective for data imbalanced MRC tasks, which uses weight coefficients to adjust the weight of positive and negative samples and distinguish between easy and difficult samples. We propose using the same model to perform mirror distillation so that the teacher model can provide the correct and wrong knowledge for the student model to learn, obtain better model generalization ability, and improve the accuracy of answer prediction. Our results show that our mirror distillation method significantly improves the performance of the model. Moreover, our results also prove that the focal loss effectively solves the problem of data imbalance in the task.},

  abstract={This paper presents the implementation of the tabular learner model by FastAI for Parkinson’s disease (PD) identification. FastAI is one of the deep learning libraries that provide practitioners with high-level components that can quickly, efficiently, and easily. The dataset that we use is generated from the calculation of 29 acoustic parameters of the Multidimensional Voice Program (MDVP) in 3 different types of voice recording groups, namely PD voice, PD control voice, and Healthy voice. Our group of voice recordings was obtained from clinical assessments conducted by Taipei Medical University Hospital on PD patients and PD controls who were patients with suspected PD but not PD after clinical assessment. The healthy voice recording group we collected as a dataset contribution with a total of 55 healthy voice recording samples, 145 PD voice recording samples, and 55 control PD voice recording samples. Samples were recorded with vocal /a/ and vocal /u/ for 3 seconds with a recording distance of 5 cm, 16-bit quantization, and the sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. Our proposed model achieves the best results with an accuracy of 82%, root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.35 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.94 using a dataset of PD voice recordings and healthy voice recordings. It was concluded that the tabular learner model by FastAI has considerable potential for PD identification based on voice recordings.},

However, the dynamic and complex characteristics of future networks pose challenges in designing novel resource allocation techniques due to the stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements and virtualized network infrastructures. To solve this issue, we propose a digital twin (DT)-enabled deep distributional Q-network (DDQN) framework that constructs a digital mirror of the physical slicing-enabled network to simulate its complex environment and predict the dynamic characteristics of the network. The DT of network slicing is expressed as a graph, and a graph neural network (GNN) is developed to learn the complicated relationships of the network slice. The graph-based network states are forwarded to the DDQN agent to learn the optimal network slicing policy. Through simulations, it is demonstrated that the proposed technique can satisfy the stringent QoS requirements and achieve near-optimal performance in a dynamic B5G network.},

  abstract={Stress has become one of the mental health adversaries of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several stressors like fear of infection, lockdown, and social distancing are commonly accountable for the stress. The existing stress prediction systems are less compatible to handle diversly changing stressors during COVID-19. The traditional approaches often use incomplete features from limited sources (e.g., only wearable sensor or user device) and static prediction techniques. The Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI) employs machine learning to make data from these sources usable for decision making. Therefore, In this study, we propose a Digital Twin of Mental Stress (DTMS) model that employs IoT-based multimodal sensing and machine learning for mental stress prediction. We obtained 98% accuracy for four widely used Machine Learning(ML) algorithms Naïve Bayes(NB), Random Forest(RF), Multilayer Perceptron(MLP), and Decision Tree (DT).

Recommender systems are used to help learners obtain appropriate resources efficiently in online learning. To improve the performance of recommender system, more and more learner’s attributes (e.g. learning style, learning ability, knowledge level, etc.) have been considered. We are committed to proposing a learner-based recommender system, not just consider learner’s physical features, but also learner’s mood while learning. This recommender system can make recommendations according to the links between learners, and can change the recommendation strategy as learner’s mood changes, which will have a certain improvement in recommendation accuracy and makes recommended results more reasonable and interpretable.},

  pages={82-86},
  abstract={Recently, many fully supervised deep learning based methods have been proposed for automatic cardiac segmentation. However, it is very expensive and time-consuming to annotate data for the task. In this paper, we present a novel dual attention based uncertainty-aware mean teacher semi-supervised framework (DA-UAMT) for cardiac image segmentation. The framework consists of a teacher model and a student model with the same structure and the student model learns from the teacher model by minimizing a segmentation loss generated from labeled images and a consistency loss generated from unlabeled images with respect to the targets of the teacher model. To enable the student model learn from more reliable targets, we introduce the Monte Carlo Dropout which estimates target uncertainty, and a novel dual attention mechanism which helps the network to focus on information in shape and channel dimension. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments on MICCAI 2017 Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset. Experiments show that our proposed DA-UAMT model is effective in utilizing unlabeled data to obtain considerably better segmentation of cardiac.},

The aim of the work is to create an intelligent assistant for an indoor navigation system designed for blind and visually impaired people. The development of an intelligent assistant is based on a semantic user model and a four-level ontological model of the subject domain. To build a dialogue between an intelligent assistant and a user, we use the theory of speech acts, argumentation theory and case-based reasoning. The developed software system is aimed at identifying the desires and user needs and proposing possible user actions aimed at achieving them.

  abstract={Advanced services leveraged for future smart cities have played a significant role in the advancement of 5G networks towards the 6G vision. Interactive immersive applications are an example of those enabled services. Such applications allow for the interaction between multiple users in a 3D environment created by virtual presentations of real objects and participants using various technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Extended Reality (XR), Digital Twin (DT) and holography. These applications require advanced computing models which allow for the processing of massive gathered amounts of data. Motions, gestures and object modification should be captured, added to the virtual environment, and shared with all the participants. Relying only on the cloud to process this data can cause significant delays. Therefore, a hybrid cloud/edge architecturewith an intelligent resource orchestration mechanism, that is able to allocate the available capacities efficiently is necessary. In this paper, a blockchain and federated learning-enabled predicted edge-resource allocation (FLP-RA) algorithm is introduced to manage the allocation of computing resources in B5G networks. It allows for smart edge nodes to train their local data and share it with other nodes to create a global estimation of future network loads. As such, nodes are able to make accurate decisions to distribute the available resources to provide the lowest computing delay.},

  abstract={Efficient path planning is the key enabling technology for the realization of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, due to poor real-time performance and lack of effective incentive methods, it is difficult for traditional path planning schemes to significantly improve the efficiency of traffic management. In addition, existing solutions that use driving distance and driving time as indicators cannot meet the personalized requirements of vehicle users. To this end, by considering the personalized requirements of vehicle users, we propose a digital-twin (DT) enabled path planning scheme to facilitate traffic management. To be specific, based on the collection of traffic data, we first establish a DT architecture for traffic scheduling to reduce the delay of path planning. Then, according to the traffic density of different road sections, we regard road sections as resources and set different rewards for different road sections to encourage vehicles to obey the scheduling instructions. In addition, by jointly considering the driving time and rewards, we further design personalized utility models to map the requirements of different vehicle users. After that, based on the personalized requirement of the vehicle user, we use a $Q$-learning algorithm to obtain the optimal path with the target of maximizing the user's utility. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can bring higher utility to the vehicle users than the conventional schemes.},

  abstract={Federated learning provides a solution for data privacy protection, while enabling training over the local data samples, without exchanging them. However, it is far from practical and secure because data privacy is still vulnerable due to the well-studied attacks, e.g., membership inference attacks and model inversion attacks. In this paper, to further prevent data leakage against these attacks, we propose FL-PATE, a differentially private federated learning framework with knowledge transfer. Specifically, participants with sensitive data are grouped to train teacher models under federated learning settings, and the knowledge of teacher models is transferred to a publicly accessible student model for prediction via aggregating teacher models' outputs of public datasets. A modified client-level differential privacy mechanism is used to guarantee each participant's data privacy during the corresponding teacher model's training process. The proposed framework preserves participant's privacy against membership inference attacks and the differential privacy cost is fixed. The privacy analysis and experiments demonstrate that trained teacher and student models have an excellent performance in accuracy and robustness theoretically and empirically.},

They have shown high learning capabilities for open domain dialogue with huge amounts of data and also for domain adaptation in task-oriented setups. But the potential benefits of exploiting the users' audio signal have rarely been explored in such frameworks. In this work, we combine text dialogue history representations generated by a GPT-2 model with audio embeddings obtained by the recently released Wav2Vec2 transformer model. We jointly fine-tune these models to learn dialogue policies via supervised learning and two policy gradient-based reinforcement learning algorithms. Our experimental results, using the DSTC2 dataset and a simulated user model capable of sampling audio turns, reveal that audio embeddings lead to overall higher task success (than without using audio embeddings) with statistically significant results across evaluation metrics and training algorithms.},

This research paper aims to work on how to implement the Goal-Directed Design (GDD) method in designing the user interface. This paper will discuss in detail implementation of the 5 phases of the GDD method instead of the entire 6 phases in designing the user interface. Moreover, the work will also be discussing the research method used to gather the users’ desires and expectations from the product/website. The study used qualitative research methodology, and due to limited resources at hand, the researcher had access to a hand full of volunteers to conduct the field research, who were able to gather sufficient data needed to implement the GDD design method. The study commences the interface designing by identifying user objectives and behavior and translating them into the user model of the interface designed for job posting and seeking website. System Usability Scale (SUS) measurement parameters of usability testing were used to test the usability. The finding shows an average usability acceptability score of more than 77.5. Therefore, it can be concluded that the usability of the design is serving its purpose is in a good category. What this paper didn’t talk about was how the design is to be translated into codes.

To this aim, in this article, we propose a sensor fault detection, isolation and accommodation (SFDIA) architecture based on machine-learning methodologies. Specifically, our architecture exploits the available spatio-temporal correlation in the sensory data in order to detect, isolate and accommodate faulty data via a bank of estimators, a bank of predictors and one classifier, all implemented via multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Faulty data are detected and isolated using the classifier, while isolated sensors are accommodated using the estimators. Performance evaluation confirms the effectiveness of the proposed SFDIA architecture to detect, isolate and accommodate faulty data injected into a (real) wireless sensor network (WSN) dataset.},

The digital twin can be used to monitor plant condition, fault diagnosis, prediction, and plant maintenance support systems. In this work, the framework for digital twin in a nuclear plant is proposed. This framework combines the application of the nuclear plant simulator and machine learning tools. The machine learning aspect of this digital twin concept is the focus of this paper. Data was generated by using a personal computer-based nuclear plant simulator. Principal component analysis was used in reducing the data dimension. Artificial neural networks and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems were trained with the reduced data and used to diagnose the faults. Four faults in the plant were diagnosed with minimal error.

  abstract={Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming ubiquitous with a proliferation of smart medical devices and applications used in smart hospitals, smart-home based care, and nursing homes. It utilizes smart medical devices and cloud computing services along with core Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to sense patients' vital body parameters, monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to support just-in-time health services. Mostly, this large amount of data is analyzed in centralized servers. Anomaly Detection (AD) in a centralized healthcare ecosystem is often plagued by significant delays in response time with high performance overhead. Moreover, there are inherent privacy issues associated with sending patients' personal health data to a centralized server, which may also introduce several security threats to the AD model, such as possibility of data poisoning. To overcome these issues with centralized AD models, here we propose a Federated Learning (FL) based AD model which utilizes edge cloudlets to run AD models locally without sharing patients' data. Since existing FL approaches perform aggregation on a single server which restricts the scope of FL, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical FL that allows aggregation at different levels enabling multi-party collaboration. We introduce a novel disease-based grouping mechanism where different AD models are grouped based on specific types of diseases. Furthermore, we develop a new Federated Time Distributed (FEDTIMEDIS) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to train the AD model. We present a Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) use case to demonstrate our model, and illustrate a proof-of-concept implementation using Digital Twin (DT) and edge cloudlets.},

  abstract={Since about 2002, Industry 4.0, and Digital Twin (DT) research as we know it today, enjoyed increasing attention in academia and industry. The research on the DTs of control valves is currently not as mature as in other critical fields. It is however of utmost importance given the role control valves play in the process, nuclear, and petroleum industries. As a common and essential part of the pipeline system, valves are used to regulate fluid flow within pipelines to achieve a desired flow condition. However, the local flow characteristics within the valve domain are difficult to determine experimentally because of complex geometry and inaccessibility of the flow domain. The application of DT technology in pipelines allows real-time fluid flow data transmission both at global and local levels, and performance monitoring of the system as well as for predicting remaining useful life. Big data analytics and machine learning can be leveraged to improve valve system performance prediction as well as to improve safety. This paper describes initial work carried out on developing a control valve digital twin which incorporates tools for monitoring local flow conditions in the control valve. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to determine the internal characteristics of the fluid inside the valve, and the data are analysed and managed through the development of a DT of the valve system.},

This paper surveys the traditional field of automated planning and explores its application to the field of information security and in particular, automating cyber incident response. Relevant AI planning techniques are then applied to implement a prototype which demonstrates the feasibility of automating incident response, focusing on False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) against smart grid as a use case.

Local BMS and other control methods encountered great difficulties to identify battery charging state and health state. This paper presents a digital twin based BESS state estimation method which utilizes the data storage and computational ability of cloud platform. Therefore, all the real-time data from the scattered BESSs can be aggregated and analyzed for modelling and parameter identification. This provides a more accurate and adjustable modelling solution. The BESS components are analyzed and the corresponding failure modes are given, and the battery state and fault are inspected from the whole system not battery itself.

  abstract={The integrated energy system is different from the power system in that it integrates a variety of energy forms and coupling devices. The structure and scale are more complex, and the collection of system parameters is brutal. In this case, how to optimize the unit output to reduce the operation cost and maintain the safe and stable operation of the system has become an important research direction. This paper presents a method to build a virtual environment of an integrated energy system based on digital twin technology and find the optimal output strategy of the unit through a deep reinforcement learning decision model. Firstly, the real-time operation data of the integrated energy system are collected by multi-dimensional sensors to build a digital twin virtual environment. Secondly, the real-time output of the unit is simulated through the digital twin, which provides the relevant operation parameter basis for the follow-up deep reinforcement learning decision-making. Finally, the deep reinforcement learning decision model is used to find the optimal strategy for unit output, and the information is fed back to the terminal controller in real-time through the digital twin to guide the output of the integrated energy system unit. The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the unit output optimization accuracy of the integrated energy system and reduce the system operation cost.},

  abstract={As an information provision technology, non-intrusive load monitoring can extract detailed load consumption separately from the mains reading, which is conducive to promoting residential consumers to join the demand-side response. The current deep learning model has been proven to be effective in NILM, but the huge amount of trainable parameters limits its implementation in hardware systems. Therefore, the knowledge distillation method is introduced into NILM. In this article, bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) based on the spatial attention mechanism is first constructed as a teacher model to guide student model learning. Then, a small-scale student model is constructed, and the training of the model is implemented under the guidance of the teacher model. The experiments confirm that the proposed teacher model achieves better results than other methods, and the student model can also obtain results close to the teacher model, which provides a research direction for the deployment of deep learning models in hardware systems.},

  abstract={Existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate predictions. One promising technique to obtain an accurate yet lightweight pose estimator is knowledge distillation, which distills the pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model. However, existing pose distillation works rely on a heavy pre-trained estimator to perform knowledge transfer and require a complex two-stage learning procedure. In this work, we investigate a novel Online Knowledge Distillation framework by distilling Human Pose structure knowledge in a one-stage manner to guarantee the distillation efficiency, termed OKDHP. Specifically, OKDHP trains a single multi-branch network and acquires the predicted heatmaps from each, which are then assembled by a Feature Aggregation Unit (FAU) as the target heatmaps to teach each branch in reverse. Instead of simply averaging the heatmaps, FAU which consists of multiple parallel transformations with different receptive fields, leverages the multi-scale information, thus obtains target heatmaps with higher-quality. Specifically, the pixel-wise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is utilized to mini-mize the discrepancy between the target heatmaps and the predicted ones, which enables the student network to learn the implicit keypoint relationship. Besides, an unbalanced OKDHP scheme is introduced to customize the student networks with different compression rates. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by extensive experiments on two common benchmark datasets, MPII and COCO.},

  abstract={The popularity of multimodal sensors and the accessibility of the Internet have brought us a massive amount of unlabeled multimodal data. Since existing datasets and well-trained models are primarily unimodal, the modality gap between a unimodal network and unlabeled multi-modal data poses an interesting problem: how to transfer a pre-trained unimodal network to perform the same task with extra unlabeled multimodal data? In this work, we propose multimodal knowledge expansion (MKE), a knowledge distillation-based framework to effectively utilize multimodal data without requiring labels. Opposite to traditional knowledge distillation, where the student is designed to be lightweight and inferior to the teacher, we observe that a multimodal student model consistently rectifies pseudo labels and generalizes better than its teacher. Extensive experiments on four tasks and different modalities verify this finding. Furthermore, we connect the mechanism of MKE to semi-supervised learning and offer both empirical and theoretical explanations to understand the expansion capability of a multimodal student.1},

  abstract={Despite the fast progress in training specialized models for various tasks, learning a single general model that works well for many tasks is still challenging for computer vision. Here we introduce multi-task self-training (MuST), which harnesses the knowledge in independent specialized teacher models (e.g., ImageNet model on classification) to train a single general student model. Our approach has three steps. First, we train specialized teachers independently on labeled datasets. We then use the specialized teachers to label an unlabeled dataset to create a multi-task pseudo labeled dataset. Finally, the dataset, which now contains pseudo labels from teacher models trained on different datasets/tasks, is then used to train a student model with multi-task learning. We evaluate the feature representations of the student model on 6 vision tasks including image recognition (classification, detection, segmentation) and 3D geometry estimation (depth and surface normal estimation). MuST is scalable with unlabeled or partially labeled datasets and outperforms both specialized supervised models and self-supervised models when training on large scale datasets. Lastly, we show MuST can improve upon already strong checkpoints [23] trained with billions of examples. The results suggest self-training is a promising direction to aggregate labeled and unlabeled training data for learning general feature representations.},

  abstract={While deep neural networks have shown impressive performance in many tasks, they are fragile to carefully de-signed adversarial attacks. We propose a novel adversarial training-based model by Attention Guided Knowledge Distillation and Bi-directional Metric Learning (AGKD-BML). The attention knowledge is obtained from a weight-fixed model trained on a clean dataset, referred to as a teacher model, and transferred to a model that is under training on adversarial examples (AEs), referred to as a student model. In this way, the student model is able to focus on the correct region, as well as correcting the intermediate features corrupted by AEs to eventually improve the model accuracy. Moreover, to efficiently regularize the representation in feature space, we propose a bidirectional metric learning. Specifically, given a clean image, it is first attacked to its most confusing class to get the forward AE. A clean image in the most confusing class is then randomly picked and attacked back to the original class to get the backward AE. A triplet loss is then used to shorten the representation distance between original image and its AE, while enlarge that between the forward and backward AEs. We conduct extensive adversarial robustness experiments on two widely used datasets with different attacks. Our proposed AGKD-BML model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The code of AGKD-BML will be available at: https://github.com/hongw579/AGKD-BML.},

  abstract={Recently, contrastive learning has achieved great results in self-supervised learning, where the main idea is to pull two augmentations of an image (positive pairs) closer compared to other random images (negative pairs). We argue that not all negative images are equally negative. Hence, we introduce a self-supervised learning algorithm where we use a soft similarity for the negative images rather than a binary distinction between positive and negative pairs. We iteratively distill a slowly evolving teacher model to the student model by capturing the similarity of a query image to some random images and transferring that knowledge to the student. Specifically, our method should handle unbalanced and unlabeled data better than existing contrastive learning methods, because the randomly chosen negative set might include many samples that are semantically similar to the query image. In this case, our method labels them as highly similar while standard contrastive methods label them as negatives. Our method achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art models.

  abstract={Semi-supervised approaches for crowd counting attract attention, as the fully supervised paradigm is expensive and laborious due to its request for a large number of images of dense crowd scenarios and their annotations. This paper proposes a spatial uncertainty-aware semi-supervised approach via regularized surrogate task (binary segmentation) for crowd counting problems. Different from existing semi-supervised learning-based crowd counting methods, to exploit the unlabeled data, our proposed spatial uncertainty-aware teacher-student framework focuses on high confident regions’ information while addressing the noisy supervision from the unlabeled data in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we estimate the spatial uncertainty maps from the teacher model’s surrogate task to guide the feature learning of the main task (density regression) and the surrogate task of the student model at the same time. Besides, we introduce a simple yet effective differential transformation layer to enforce the inherent spatial consistency regularization between the main task and the surrogate task in the student model, which helps the surrogate task to yield more reliable predictions and generates high-quality uncertainty maps. Thus, our model can also address the task-level perturbation problems that occur spatial inconsistency between the primary and surrogate tasks in the student model. Experimental results on four challenging crowd counting datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.

  abstract={Modern recognition systems require large amounts of supervision to achieve accuracy. Adapting to new domains requires significant data from experts, which is onerous and can become too expensive. Zero-shot learning requires an annotated set of attributes for a novel category. Annotating the full set of attributes for a novel category proves to be a tedious and expensive task in deployment. This is especially the case when the recognition domain is an expert domain. We introduce a new field-guide-inspired approach to zero-shot annotation where the learner model interactively asks for the most useful attributes that define a class. We evaluate our method on classification benchmarks with attribute annotations like CUB, SUN, and AWA2 and show that our model achieves the performance of a model with full annotations at the cost of significantly fewer number of annotations. Since the time of experts is precious, decreasing annotation cost can be very valuable for real-world deployment.},

  abstract={Recent research efforts in lifelong learning propose to grow a mixture of models to adapt to an increasing number of tasks. The proposed methodology shows promising results in overcoming catastrophic forgetting. However, the theory behind these successful models is still not well understood. In this paper, we perform the theoretical analysis for lifelong learning models by deriving the risk bounds based on the discrepancy distance between the probabilistic representation of data generated by the model and that corresponding to the target dataset. Inspired by the theoretical analysis, we introduce a new lifelong learning approach, namely the Lifelong Infinite Mixture (LIMix) model, which can automatically expand its network architectures or choose an appropriate component to adapt its parameters for learning a new task, while preserving its previously learnt information. We propose to incorporate the knowledge by means of Dirichlet processes by using a gating mechanism which computes the dependence between the knowledge learnt previously and stored in each component, and a new set of data. Besides, we train a compact Student model which can accumulate cross-domain representations over time and make quick inferences.

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={15132-15141},
  abstract={Lane detection is a key task for autonomous driving vehicles. Currently, lane detection relies on a huge amount of annotated images, which is a heavy burden. Active learning has been proposed to reduce annotation in many computer vision tasks, but no effort has been made for lane detection. Through experiments, we find that existing active learning methods perform poorly for lane detection, and the reasons are twofold. On one hand, most methods evaluate data uncertainties based on entropy, which is undesirable in lane detection because it encourages to select images with very few lanes or even no lane at all. On the other hand, existing methods are not aware of the noise of lane annotations, which is caused by heavy occlusion and unclear lane marks. In this paper, we build a novel knowledge distillation framework and evaluate the uncertainty of images based on the knowledge learnt by the student model. We show that the proposed uncertainty metric overcomes the above two problems. To reduce data redundancy, we explore the influence sets of image samples, and propose a new diversity metric for data selection. Finally we incorporate the uncertainty and diversity metrics, and develop a greedy algorithm for data selection. The experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art on the lane detection benchmarks. In addition, we extend this method to common 2D object detection and the results show that it is also effective.},

Our method aims at introducing the teacher model, which can utilize data from tasks so far, to prevent the student model from catastrophic forgetting. For each task, the teacher model learn to capture the knowledge contained in the tasks by now. When a new task is presented, the student model is encouraged to learn from the teacher model so that the information on which the previous task relied is retained. At the same time, we also make the student model to review its own knowledge to further alleviate catastrophic forgetting. The evaluation of continuous SAR target recognition task shows that this method reduces forgetting effect.},

  abstract={Machine learning (ML) is becoming a more frequently used approach to deal with GPR and other electromagnetic problems, which due to the complexity of the data, require new more complex solutions. We have developed an ML framework to provide solutions to specific GPR applications and scenarios. The ML tools utilize neural networks (NNs) and a large training set originating from simulations that include a digital twin of a real GPR transducer. The applications investigated are background removal, automatic estimation of the background bulk permittivity in conjunction with a reverse time migration (RTM) scheme that utilizes the ML outputs and is applied to reinforced concrete slab scenarios. The schemes are validated using both synthetic and real data, showing a very good accuracy and demonstrating the success of the ML algorithms. Although, this ML framework is applicable to certain applications and scenarios, it can be easily extended to other classes of problems.},

  abstract={Neurological impairment is a common disorder observed in stroke population and Electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring is considered a significant marker for diagnostics stroke onset. This study aims to propose a proof-of-concept of a healthcare “digital twin” and utilize EEG data and machine-learning models to build a digital twin for the stroke patients. We examined 48 stroke patients admitted to a rehabilitation clinic and 75 healthy persons. Portable EEG devices were used to capture EEG using frontal, central, temporal, and occipital cortical electrodes. The statistical analysis revealed that the revised brain-symmetry index, theta, and delta activities are relevant characteristics for classifying stroke patients and healthy individuals in motor and cognitive states. Using the machine learning approach, Support vector machine (SVM) classified the EEG feature dataset with 76% accuracy (AUC: 0.84) for classifying the stroke and the control group. This healthcare digital twin framework may assist in clinical decision-making for stroke preventive measures and post-stroke treatment.},

  title={Personalized Image Aesthetics Assessment via Meta-Learning With Bilevel Gradient Optimization}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={52},
  number={3},
  pages={1798-1811},
  abstract={Typical image aesthetics assessment (IAA) is modeled for the generic aesthetics perceived by an “average” user. However, such generic aesthetics models neglect the fact that users’ aesthetic preferences vary significantly depending on their unique preferences. Therefore, it is essential to tackle the issue for personalized IAA (PIAA). Since PIAA is a typical small sample learning (SSL) problem, existing PIAA models are usually built by fine-tuning the well-established generic IAA (GIAA) models, which are regarded as prior knowledge. Nevertheless, this kind of prior knowledge based on “average aesthetics” fails to incarnate the aesthetic diversity of different people. In order to learn the shared prior knowledge when different people judge aesthetics, that is, learn how people judge image aesthetics, we propose a PIAA method based on meta-learning with bilevel gradient optimization (BLG-PIAA), which is trained using individual aesthetic data directly and generalizes to unknown users quickly. The proposed approach consists of two phases: 1) meta-training and 2) meta-testing. In meta-training, the aesthetics assessment of each user is regarded as a task, and the training set of each task is divided into two sets: 1) support set and 2) query set. Unlike traditional methods that train a GIAA model based on average aesthetics, we train an aesthetic meta-learner model by bilevel gradient updating from the support set to the query set using many users’ PIAA tasks. In meta-testing, the aesthetic meta-learner model is fine-tuned using a small amount of aesthetic data of a target user to obtain the PIAA model. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art PIAA metrics, and the learned prior model of BLG-PIAA can be quickly adapted to unseen PIAA tasks.},

  pages={893-906},
  abstract={Significant progress has been made with face photo–sketch synthesis in recent years due to the development of deep convolutional neural networks, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, the performance of existing methods is still limited because of the lack of training data (photo–sketch pairs). To address this challenge, we investigate the effect of knowledge distillation (KD) on training neural networks for the face photo–sketch synthesis task and propose an effective KD model to improve the performance of synthetic images. In particular, we utilize a teacher network trained on a large amount of data in a related task to separately learn knowledge of the face photo and knowledge of the face sketch and simultaneously transfer this knowledge to two student networks designed for the face photo–sketch synthesis task. In addition to assimilating the knowledge from the teacher network, the two student networks can mutually transfer their own knowledge to further enhance their learning. To further enhance the perception quality of the synthetic image, we propose a KD+ model that combines GANs with KD. The generator can produce images with more realistic textures and less noise under the guide of knowledge. Extensive experiments and a user study demonstrate the superiority of our models over the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={The air-ground network provides users with seamless connections and real-time services, while its resource constraint triggers a paradigm shift from machine learning to federated learning. Federated learning enables clients to collaboratively train models without sharing data. Digital twins provide virtual representation of the air-ground networks to reflect the time-varying status, which in combination with federated learning reconcile the conflict between privacy protection and data training in air-ground networks. In this paper, we consider dynamic digital twin and federated learning for air-ground networks where a drone works as the aggregator and the ground clients collaboratively train the model based on the network dynamics captured by digital twins. We design incentives for federated learning based on Stackelberg game, in which the digital twin of the drone acts as the leader to set preferences for clients, and clients as follower choose the global training rounds. Furthermore, considering the varying digital twin deviations and network dynamics, we design a dynamic incentive scheme to adaptively adjust the selection of the optimal clients and their participation level. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes can significantly improve accuracy and energy efficiency.},

  year={2022},

  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Deep learning has seen dramatic improvements in remote-sensing image scene classification. However, hard categories and hard examples widely exist in the data sets, due to the intraclass diversity and interclass similarity. In this letter, we propose a novel framework to address these issues. Specifically, our method first trains a general model to obtain the confusion matrix and select the hard categories. Then a sampling strategy is proposed to restructure the training set and an expert model is trained to focus on the hard categories. Finally, the knowledge of the expert model is distilled into the student model through a novel loss function, which encourages the student model to predict the hard label provided by manual annotation. Thus, the model can match the soft label provided by the expert model and pay more attention to the hard examples simultaneously. With this method, the student model cannot only deal with hard categories but also hard examples existing in other easy categories. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we comprehensively evaluate the method on three publicly available benchmark data sets, the obtained results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing baseline methods and achieves superior results on all three data sets.},

  pages={1377-1386},
  abstract={Recently, along with several technological advancements in cyber-physical systems, the revolution of Industry 4.0 has brought in an emerging concept named digital twin (DT), which shows its potential to break the barrier between the physical and cyber space in smart manufacturing. However, it is still difficult to analyze and estimate the real-time structural and environmental parameters in terms of their dynamic changes in digital twinning, especially when facing detection tasks of multiple small objects from a large-scale scene with complex contexts in modern manufacturing environments. In this article, we focus on a small object detection model for DT, aiming to realize the dynamic synchronization between a physical manufacturing system and its virtual representation. Three significant elements, including equipment, product, and operator, are considered as the basic environmental parameters to represent and estimate the dynamic characteristics and real-time changes in building a generic DT system of smart manufacturing workshop. A hybrid deep neural network model, based on the integration of MobileNetv2, YOLOv4, and Openpose, is constructed to identify the real-time status from physical manufacturing environment to virtual space. A learning algorithm is then developed to realize the efficient multitype small object detection based on the feature integration and fusion from both shallow and deep layers, in order to facilitate the modeling, monitoring, and optimizing of the whole manufacturing process in the DT system. Experiments and evaluations conducted in three different use cases demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our proposed method, which can achieve a higher detection accuracy for DT in smart manufacturing.},

  abstract={The rapid proliferation of smart vehicles along with the advent of powerful applications bring stringent requirements on massive content delivery. Although vehicular edge caching can facilitate delay-bounded content transmission, constrained storage capacity and limited serving range of an individual cache server as well as highly dynamic topology of vehicular networks may degrade the efficiency of content delivery. To address the problem, in this article, we propose a social-aware vehicular edge caching mechanism that dynamically orchestrates the cache capability of roadside units (RSUs) and smart vehicles according to user preference similarity and service availability. Furthermore, catering to the complexity and variability of vehicular social characteristics, we leverage the digital twin technology to map the edge caching system into virtual space, which facilitates constructing the social relation model. Based on the social model, a new concept of vehicular cache cloud is developed to incorporate the correlation of content storing between multiple cache-enabled vehicles in diverse traffic environments. Then, we propose deep learning empowered optimal caching schemes, jointly considering the social model construction, cache cloud formation, and cache resource allocation. We evaluate the proposed schemes based on real traffic data. Numerical results demonstrate that our edge caching schemes have great advantages in optimizing caching utility.},

  year={2022},
  volume={44},

  pages={5026-5041},
  abstract={We present DistillFlow, a knowledge distillation approach to learning optical flow. DistillFlow trains multiple teacher models and a student model, where challenging transformations are applied to the input of the student model to generate hallucinated occlusions as well as less confident predictions. Then, a self-supervised learning framework is constructed: confident predictions from teacher models are served as annotations to guide the student model to learn optical flow for those less confident predictions. The self-supervised learning framework enables us to effectively learn optical flow from unlabeled data, not only for non-occluded pixels, but also for occluded pixels. DistillFlow achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised learning performance on both KITTI and Sintel datasets. Our self-supervised pre-trained model also provides an excellent initialization for supervised fine-tuning, suggesting an alternate training paradigm in contrast to current supervised learning methods that highly rely on pre-training on synthetic data. At the time of writing, our fine-tuned models ranked 1st among all monocular methods on the KITTI 2015 benchmark, and outperform all published methods on the Sintel Final benchmark. More importantly, we demonstrate the generalization capability of DistillFlow in three aspects: framework generalization, correspondence generalization and cross-dataset generalization. Our code and models will be available on https://github.com/ppliuboy/DistillFlow.},

  abstract={Emerging digital twin (DT) and mobile-edge computing (MEC) are crucial for enabling the rapid development of 6G. However, the existing works ignore the edge collaboration, which can provide the system with additional performance gain. In this article, we study the problem of mobile users (MUs) intelligently offloading tasks to cooperative mobile-edge servers (MESs) with the assistance of DT. Specifically, a DT-assisted task offloading scheme (DTTOS) that consists of the selection of MESs and intelligent task offloading is proposed. Channel state information (CSI) and blockchain are employed to implement the selection of MESs. Then, we present a solution to enable MU’s task offloading that is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) in an intelligent way. After this, a mathematical optimization model aiming at decreasing power and time overhead is formulated. In view of the complexity, it is decomposed into two suboptimization models and solved by the decision tree algorithm (DTA) and double deep- $Q$ -learning (DDQN), respectively. Simulations are conducted to prove the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of data security assurance and network performance improvement.},

  pages={101-116},
  abstract={Intelligent task placement and management of tasks in large-scale fog platforms is challenging due to the highly volatile nature of modern workload applications and sensitive user requirements of low energy consumption and response time. Container orchestration platforms have emerged to alleviate this problem with prior art either using heuristics to quickly reach scheduling decisions or AI driven methods like reinforcement learning and evolutionary approaches to adapt to dynamic scenarios. The former often fail to quickly adapt in highly dynamic environments, whereas the latter have run-times that are slow enough to negatively impact response time. Therefore, there is a need for scheduling policies that are both reactive to work efficiently in volatile environments and have low scheduling overheads. To achieve this, we propose a Gradient Based Optimization Strategy using Back-propagation of gradients with respect to Input (GOBI). Further, we leverage the accuracy of predictive digital-twin models and simulation capabilities by developing a Coupled Simulation and Container Orchestration Framework (COSCO). Using this, we create a hybrid simulation driven decision approach, GOBI*, to optimize Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. Co-simulation and the back-propagation approaches allow these methods to adapt quickly in volatile environments. Experiments conducted using real-world data on fog applications using the GOBI and GOBI* methods, show a significant improvement in terms of energy consumption, response time, Service Level Objective and scheduling time by up to 15, 40, 4, and 82 percent respectively when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Existing works usually learn coarse global context when predicting relationships leading to excessive redundant information being considered. In this article, we first classify objects into different subgroups according to the degree of correlations with several hub objects. Then, we propose a multihub driven attention network (MHDANet) based on deep learning that drives the information to pass within the subgroups and forces objects to attend more to related objects. Consequently, MHDANet learns compact relation-aware features of visual scenes and predicts accurate and diverse relationships. Experimental results show that MHDANet achieves superb performance on scene graph generation on real-world datasets and especially alleviates the imbalance of predicted relationship categories.},

Pepper robot has been featured with arms and hands, but its motors and actuators cannot support intensive experimental sessions and training procedures to learn how safely touch objects.

By a virtual and reliable replica of the robot, machine learning procedures can be seamlessly moved to/from the digital twin with a significant speedup and preventing the physical robot from deterioration. As a practical application, the reported case study is inspired to ambient-assisted living in elderly assistance. The experience, as well as the entire design and development process, has revealed VPepper and the smart environment to offer interesting opportunities for the physical accuracy of the simulation and for the availability of machine learning instruments that may be converted and adopted for real settings.

  abstract={As a class of randomized learner model, stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) have been successfully applied in a few data analytics tasks. Given the industrial big data modeling tasks, however, the original SCNs potentially lead to excessive training time. To this end, this article extends SCNs to a hybrid parallel version, termed hybrid parallel SCNs (HPSCNs). In the hybrid parallel learning algorithm, two SCNs are synchronously constructed. The difference between the two of them is that one employs a point-incremental algorithm, and another one adopts a block-incremental algorithm. Moreover, a data parallel method is established based on a dynamic block strategy to accelerate the establishment of candidate node pool for each SCN. Additionally, this article proposes an adaptive hyperparameter adjustment method, which allows the hyperparameters in the supervisory mechanism to be automatically adjusted along with the learning process. Comparative experiments are first conducted through four large-scale benchmark datasets, followed by the fully discussion on the algorithm parameters. Finally, a practical industrial application case is made, where a grinding particle size soft sensor is developed based on HPSCN, showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract={Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging approach for collaboratively training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on mobile devices, without private user data leaving the devices. Previous works have shown that non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) user data harms the convergence speed of the FL algorithms. Furthermore, most existing work on FL measures global-model accuracy, but in many cases, such as user content-recommendation, improving individual User model Accuracy (UA) is the real objective. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Task FL (MTFL) algorithm that introduces non-federated Batch-Normalization (BN) layers into the federated DNN. MTFL benefits UA and convergence speed by allowing users to train models personalised to their own data. MTFL is compatible with popular iterative FL optimisation algorithms such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), and we show empirically that a distributed form of Adam optimisation (FedAvg-Adam) benefits convergence speed even further when used as the optimisation strategy within MTFL. Experiments using MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate that MTFL is able to significantly reduce the number of rounds required to reach a target UA, by up to $5\times$5× when using existing FL optimisation strategies, and with a further $3\times$3× improvement when using FedAvg-Adam. We compare MTFL to competing personalised FL algorithms, showing that it is able to achieve the best UA for MNIST and CIFAR10 in all considered scenarios. Finally, we evaluate MTFL with FedAvg-Adam on an edge-computing testbed, showing that its convergence and UA benefits outweigh its overhead.},

In this article, we propose a product design framework for Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, namely, DT-aided IoT platform design (DTIPD). This framework considers a large number of IoT devices performing different tasks with machine learning (ML) technologies. Each IoT device constructs a particular ML-based model that deals with its task automatically by feeding related data with labels. The challenges of large-scale network management and ground-truth shortage at the initial stage of product iteration are addressed. We propose a two-level hierarchical learning process using the real-time model status stored at DT servers (DTS), aiming to improve product quality while shortening the development lifecycle. The comprehensive experimental results for both the single-DTS and multiple-DTS scenarios demonstrate the applicability of our framework.},

  abstract={Anomaly-based machine learning-enabled intrusion detection systems (AML-IDSs) show low performance and prediction accuracy while detecting intrusions in the Internet of Things (IoT) than that of deep learning-based intrusion detection systems (DL-IDSs). In particular, AML-IDS that employ low complexity models for IoT, such as the principal component machine (PCA) method and the one-class support vector machine (1-SVM) method, are inefficient in detecting intrusions when compared to DL-IDS with the two-class neural network (2-NN) method. PCA and 1-SVM AML-IDS suffer from low detection rates compared to DL-IDS. The size of the data set and the number of features or variants in the data set may influence how well PCA and 1-SVM AML-IDS perform compared to DL-IDS. We attribute the low performance and prediction accuracy of the AML-IDS model to an imbalanced data set, a low similarity index between the training data and testing data, and the use of a single-learner model. The intrinsic limitations of the single-learner model have a direct impact on the accuracy of an intelligent IDS. Also, the dissimilarity between testing data and training data leads to an increasingly high rate of false positives (FPs) in AML-IDS than DL-IDS, which have low false alarms and high predictability. In this article, we examine the use of optimization techniques to enhance the performance of single-learner AML-IDS, such as PCA and 1-SVM AML-IDS models for building efficient, scalable, and distributed intelligent IDS for detecting intrusions in IoT. We evaluate these AML-IDS models by tuning hyperparameters and ensemble learning optimization techniques using the Microsoft Azure ML Studio (AMLS) platform and two data sets containing malicious and benign IoT and industrial IoT (IIoT) network traffic. Furthermore, we present a comparative analysis of AML-IDS models for IoT regarding their performance and predictability.},
