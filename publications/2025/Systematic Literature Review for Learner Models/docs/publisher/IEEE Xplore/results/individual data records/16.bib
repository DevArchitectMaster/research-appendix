  abstract={The CPS technology based on the digital twin provides a dynamic and accurate digital model and real-time control of equipment for the construction of the smart grid. However, integrating physical and information sides makes the power grid CPS system vulnerable to attacks from the network and physical sensors, which brings new challenges to communication security. From the perspective of collaborative, secure communication, this paper proposes a secure transmission scheme for power grid CPS based on physical layer security and deep reinforcement learning. Grid transmission nodes select idle trusted devices as relay transmission nodes. Signals are transmitted between nodes through narrow directional beams, which alleviates blocking effects and prevents eavesdroppers from obtaining good eavesdropping capacity. We use the multi-agent dual-dueling deep Q-network algorithm (D3QN) to optimize the selection of cooperative nodes, maximizing the total secrecy ability as the optimization objective. The simulation experiment proves that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the secrecy ability of CPS nodes.},

  abstract={This paper focuses on an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approach for fault localization in a squirrel cage three-phase induction motor (TIM). A multifaceted Digital-Twin (DT) is designed by integrating physics domain knowledge with AI algorithms. The aim is to design a Multiphysics-informed hybrid DT for fault detection and localization in TIM. To achieve this, a high-fidelity computational model of an induction motor is developed using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in COMSOL Multiphysics. The model parameters, loading conditions, and boundary conditions are meticulously tuned with an experimental workbench using a Sparse Nonlinear Optimization (SNOPT) solver. Simulations are conducted to replicate various electrical and mechanical defects. Additionally, the model order reduction technique is employed to generate a reduced state-space model, enabling the high-fidelity dynamic system to act as a virtual sensor exhibiting real-time capabilities. The feature fusion process leverages Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) within the hybrid DT modeling framework. Comparative analysis demonstrates that the Multiphysics-informed hybrid modeling approach enhances the interpretability of AI classifiers, improving real-time condition monitoring and fault localization in TIM.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the issue of high resource consumption in named entity recognition (NER) under large models by utilizing meta-learning and structured distillation to generate lightweight models. Knowledge distillation from commonly used models in NER tasks poses challenges because of the exponentially large output space. Previous work treated it as a structured prediction task for distillation, but did not consider utilizing the feedback from the student model to optimize the student itself. Therefore, this paper proposes Meta-Structured Distillation (MSD). Specifically, this paper incorporates meta-learning into structured distillation, updating the teacher parameters based on the student's performance feedback on the dataset to obtain a better student model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing improvement over previous work in structured distillation.},

  pages={8077-8083},
  abstract={Change detection and irregular object extraction in 3D point clouds is a challenging task that is of high importance not only for autonomous navigation but also for updating existing digital twin models of various industrial environments. This article proposes an innovative approach for change detection in 3D point clouds using deep learned place recognition descriptors and irregular object extraction based on voxel-to-point comparison. The proposed method first aligns the bi-temporal point clouds using a map-merging algorithm in order to establish a common coordinate frame. Then, it utilizes deep learning techniques to extract robust and discriminative features from the 3D point cloud scans, which are used to detect changes between consecutive point cloud frames and therefore find the changed areas. Finally, the altered areas are sampled and compared between the two time instances to extract any obstructions that caused the area to change. The proposed method was successfully evaluated in real-world field experiments, where it was able to detect different types of changes in 3D point clouds, such as object or muck-pile addition and displacement, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach. The results of this study demonstrate important implications for various applications, including safety and security monitoring in construction sites, mapping and exploration and suggests potential future research directions in this field.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-11},
  abstract={Accurate 3D object segmentation in point clouds is a basis for industrial robot applications, such as robot manipulation and digital twin, which require an understanding of the 3D environment. However, the unstructured and disordered nature of point clouds makes it challenging, especially for the incomplete 3D data under a single view in the real-world scenario. To this end, this paper proposes a novel 3D object segmentation framework (3DT-Seg) based on Cross-Window Point Transformer (CP-Former). CP-Former captures the long-range dependencies between local windows and latent semantic boundaries to enhance the point-wise features extracted from irregular point clouds via a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism. In addition, a contrastive learning loss and an adaptive dual aggregation strategy are introduced on semantic transition regions during the semantic supervising and instance clustering process, respectively. In this way, the latent boundary information is further utilized to improve the overall segmentation performance. Experiments on the popular benchmark (SI3DS) dataset show the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach in terms of semantic and instance segmentation. Furthermore, a real-world point cloud dataset (IP-Cloud) for the robotic grasping task is presented to fully validate the effectiveness of our method in practice, where it also achieves remarkable performance.},

  pages={78-95},
  abstract={Radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) is a remarkable lightweight authentication scheme to support rapid and scalable identification in the internet of things (IoT) systems. Deep learning (DL) is a critical enabler of RFF identification by leveraging the hardware-level features. However, traditional supervised learning methods require huge labeled training samples. Therefore, how to establish a highperformance supervised learning model with few labels under practical application is still challenging. To address this issue, we in this paper propose a novel RFF semi-supervised learning (RFFSSL) model which can obtain a better performance with few meta labels. Specifically, the proposed RFFSSL model is constituted by a teacher-student network, in which the student network learns from the pseudo label predicted by the teacher. Then, the output of the student model will be exploited to improve the performance of teacher among the labeled data. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation on the accuracy is conducted. We derive about 50 GB real long-term evolution (LTE) mobile phone's raw signal datasets, which is used to evaluate various models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RFFSSL scheme can achieve up to 97% experimental testing accuracy over a noisy environment only with 10% labeled samples when training samples equal to 2700.},

  abstract={Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are increasingly significant in modern cities due to their potential to reduce air pollution. Precise and real-time estimation of energy consumption for them is imperative for effective itinerary planning and optimizing vehicle systems, which can reduce driving range anxiety and decrease energy costs. As public awareness of data privacy increases, adopting approaches that safeguard data privacy in the context of BEV energy consumption modeling is crucial. Federated Learning (FL) is a promising solution mitigating the risk of exposing sensitive information to third parties by allowing local data to remain on devices and only sharing model updates with a central server. Our work investigates the potential of using FL methods, such as FedAvg, and FedPer, to improve BEV energy consumption prediction while maintaining user privacy. We conducted experiments using data from 10 BEVs under simulated real-world driving conditions. Our results demonstrate that the FedAvg-LSTM model achieved a reduction of up to 67.84% in the MAE value of the prediction results. Furthermore, we explored various real-world scenarios and discussed how FL methods can be employed in those cases. Our findings show that FL methods can effectively improve the performance of BEV energy consumption prediction while maintaining user privacy.},

In this paper, we propose a data-driven digital twin of EV batteries in order to support the implementation of predictive analytics algorithms.

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect novel targets with only a few instances of the associated samples. Although combinations of distillation techniques and meta-learning paradigms have been acknowledged as the primary strategies for FSOD tasks, the existing distillation methods exhibit inherent biases and sensitivity to novel class variability. A critical hurdle for FSOD distillation is the difficulty in ensuring appropriate knowledge learned from the teacher model during the fine-tuning stage. Furthermore, coarse distillation procedures risk misalignment between the learned and actual distributions. This misalignment could potentially negate the benefits of positive cases and impede the detector’s evolution. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel self-distillation paradigm exclusively for the fine-tuning stage (SD-FSOD). Our methods integrate a Distribution Prototype Extractor (DPE) and Self-Distillation Memory (SDM), promoting feature distribution consistency during distillation. In detail, the DPE module reliably initializes the weights of the detector, ensuring a robust class distribution for the distillation process. Meanwhile, the SDM module utilizes decoupling techniques to divide the distillation tasks into two sub-task branches, allowing the student model to independently learn and share precise features through isolated distillation processes. The synergistic integration of feature calibration techniques and the continuous self-distillation paradigm distinctly enhances the fine-tuning process, which shows the superiority of the FSOD self-distillation methodologies. The extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach produces significant improvements and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.},

  abstract={The use of Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) in vehicular networks can lead to better connectivity, reliability, and performance. However, communication in this setting is often done over an unsecured wireless network, which creates a challenge in verifying the validity of received transactions by Internet of Vehicles (IoV) due to the untrusted network. It also creates a potential for attackers to tamper with the data content and conduct different IoV-related attacks. To address these issues, a new framework called “STIoV” has been proposed for secure and trustworthy communication in IoV. The framework includes a mutual authentication scheme to register and exchange session keys among the IoV participants, and a credit-based trust management system to assign reputation scores for the vehicular devices. The latter scheme discards transactions with low credit scores. To overcome the complexity and variability of the IoV network, digital twin technology is used to map Road Side Units (RSU) servers into virtual space, which facilitates constructing the vehicular relation model. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on deep learning techniques is also introduced to detect anomalies in the traffic flow. The legitimate data is further used by the blockchain scheme for transaction verification, block creation and addition. Finally, the proposed framework has been evaluated based on two network intrusion datasets, and the results show the accuracy and efficacy of STIoV in comparison to several recent state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract={Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been one of the common neuromonitoring modalities for real-world brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) because of its non-invasiveness, low cost, and high temporal resolution. In recent years, the emergence of lightweight and portable EEG wearable devices with low-density montages has significantly increased the convenience and usability of BCI applications. However, the use of low-density EEG montages often leads to a loss in EEG decoding performance due to the reduced number of electrodes and limited coverage of scalp regions. To address this issue, we introduce knowledge distillation (KD), a learning mechanism developed for transferring information between neural network models, to enhance the performance of low-density EEG decoding. Our framework includes a newly proposed similarity-keeping (SK) teacher-student KD scheme that allows a low-density EEG student model to acquire the inter-sample similarity from a pre-trained teacher model trained on high-density EEG data. The experimental results validate that our SK-KD framework consistently improves motor-imagery EEG decoding accuracy for low-density EEG data and outperforms other KD methods across various model architectures. As the first KD scheme developed for enhancing EEG decoding, we foresee the proposed SK-KD framework facilitating the practicality of low-density EEG-based BCI in real-world applications.},

  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={144421-144434},
  abstract={In recent years, most of the research on speech enhancement (SE) has applied different strategies to improve performance through deep neural network models. However, as the performance improves, the memory resources and computational requirements of the model also increase, making it difficult to directly apply them to edge computing. Therefore, various model compression and acceleration techniques are desired. This paper proposes a learning method that dynamically uses Knowledge Distillation (KD) to teach a small student model from a large teacher model by considering the learning ratio from the teacher’s output and the real target based on reinforcement learning (RL). During the KD learning process, RL is adopted to estimate the learning ratio by considering the reward favoring the hard target (clean speech) or the soft target (the output of the teacher model) during the training of KD. The proposed method results in a more stable training process for the resulting smaller SE model and yields improved performance. In the experiment, we used the TIMIT and CSTR VCTK datasets and evaluated two representative SE models that employ different loss functions. On the TIMIT dataset, when we reduced the number of parameters in the Wave-U-Net student model from 10.3 million to 2.6 million, our method performed better than non-KD models with improvements of 0.05 in PESQ, 0.1 in STOI, and 0.47 in the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio. Moreover, by utilizing prior knowledge from the pre-trained teacher model, our method effectively guided the learning process of the student model, achieving excellent performance even under low SNR conditions. Furthermore, we use Conv-Tasnet to further validate our proposed method. Finally, for ease of comparison, we conducted a comparison on the VCTK dataset as well.},

  abstract={There are many important and interesting academic competitions that attract an increasing number of students. However, traditional student team building methods usually have strong randomness or involve only some first-class students. To choose more suitable students to compose a team and improve students’ abilities overall, a competition-oriented student team building method is proposed. This would not only lead to better competition results by choosing more suitable students and teams but also improve the overall involvement of students in considering education fairness. First, a big data platform is constructed to collect students’ various behavior data. Based on that, a competition with a six-tuple attribute and a student with a six-tuple attribute are modeled. Then, a corresponding utility function is designed for each attribute in the student model to denote the student's utility in this attribute for attending a competition. Furthermore, a team utility function is developed for each team to denote the utilities of all involved students. A team building utility function is also developed to denote the utilities of all involved teams. Second, a multiple-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm with dimension by dimension improvement is proposed to build appropriate teams to optimize team building utility maximization and education fairness simultaneously. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that overall performance, not only our proposed team building method has better performance in terms of team utility and student ability than other current methods, but also our proposed multiple-objective optimization algorithm has better performance in terms of hyper volume and inverted generational distance than other optimization algorithms.},

Our method utilizes LLMs to generate accurate classifications and then employs established knowledge distillation techniques to create smaller, more specialized student models tailored for web content filtering. Distillation results in a student model with a 9 % accuracy rate improvement in classifying websites, sourced from customer telemetry data collected by a large security vendor, into 30 distinct content categories based on their URLs, surpassing the current state-of-the-art approach. Our student model matches the performance of the teacher LLM with 175 times less parameters, allowing the model to be used for in-line scanning of large volumes of URLs, and requires 3 orders of magnitude less manually labeled training data than the current state-of-the-art approach. Depending on the specific use case, the output generated by our approach can either be directly returned or employed as a pre-filter for more resource-intensive operations involving website images or HTML.},

In this demonstration, we introduce a pioneering approach that harnesses data-driven virtual sensing within a real-time, high-fidelity 3D digital twin of a building environment. Our innovative method provides accurate machine learning-based inference of real-time sensor variables across both two-dimensional (varying rooms) and three-dimensional (diverse elevations) domains, with limited reliance on physical sensor inputs. Thus, by extending the sensing coverage through the use of ML-driven virtual sensing, we are able to create a more accurate digital twin. Our initial results indicate a mean absolute percentage error of <1 % for temperature and around 10% for air quality parameters such as CO2, when compared against the ground truth physical sensors.},

  abstract={Medical professionals have devised novel solutions to transform the healthcare industry. Modern technology of Digital Twins (DT) can revolutionize medical treatment significantly. DT technology incorporates digitizing physical entities by constantly monitoring their current status. Conspicuously, a state-of-the-art secure framework for monitoring adults’ physical activity is formulated using the culmination of DT technology with IoT-edge computing, and blockchain technology. The presented framework is designed to discreetly secure the health data of the individual. To identify healthcare vulnerabilities in adults, the present study employs deep learning’s ability to analyze IoT data sequentially. Specifically, a deep learning-assisted Multi-Layered Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technique is proposed for real-time vulnerability assessment. Additionally, the proposed framework can protect personal healthcare data by using the blockchain technique. For performance validation, numerous simulations were performed over the challenging data set. Based on the results, the proposed methodology can outperform state-of-the-art techniques by registering enhanced values of Temporal Delay Efficacy (120.79s), Prediction Efficacy (Accuracy (92.24%), Specificity (94.67%), Sensitivity (95.26%), and F-measure (95.69%)), Reliability (91.58%), and Stability (64%).},

  abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of designing incentive mechanisms by a virtual service provider (VSP) to hire sensing IoT devices to sell their sensing data to help creating and rendering the digital copy of the physical world in the Metaverse. Due to the limited bandwidth, we propose to use semantic extraction algorithms to reduce the delivered data by the sensing IoT devices. Nevertheless, mechanisms to hire sensing IoT devices to share their data with the VSP and then deliver the constructed digital twin to the Metaverse users are vulnerable to adverse selection problem. The adverse selection problem, which is caused by information asymmetry between the system entities, becomes harder to solve when the private information of the different entities are multi-dimensional. We propose a novel iterative contract design and use a new variant of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to solve the modelled multi-dimensional contract problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we conduct extensive simulations and measure several key performance metrics of the contract for the Metaverse. Our results show that our designed iterative contract is able to incentivize the participants to interact truthfully, which maximizes the profit of the VSP with minimal individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC) violation rates. Furthermore, the proposed learning-based iterative contract framework has limited access to the private information of the participants, which is to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind in addressing the problem of adverse selection in incentive mechanisms.},

  abstract={Considering the limited resources, user mobility and unpredictable driving environment in intelligent driving, this paper studies the optimal training efficiency of federated learning for distributed training of collision warning services with the assistance of digital twin (DT). DT is emerging as one of the most promising technologies to make the digital representation of physical components for better prediction, analysis, and optimization of various services in intelligent driving. we first propose a DT-enabled collision warning framework, including physical network layer, digital twin layer, and application layer. Then, for the cooperative training of multi-level warning models combining gate recurrent unit (GRU) and support vector machine (SVM) in the digital twin layer, we propose semi-asynchronous federated learning with adaptive adjustment of parameters (SFLAAP) scheme. We aim at minimizing the training delay of collision warning model by dynamically adjusting the training parameters according to real-time training state and resource conditions of digital space, specifically the local training times and the number of local nodes participating in the aggregation, while ensuring the accuracy of the model. Considering the complexity of the target problem, we propose parameter adjustment algorithm based on asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C). Experiments on the classical dataset show high effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Specifically, SFLAAP can reduce the completion time by about 12% and improve the learning accuracy by about 1%, compared with the state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract={Equipping students with hands-on experience and knowledge of robot manipulators is crucial as robotics becomes more applicable in Industry 4.0. However, the practical implementation of physical manipulators in educational settings is challenging due to high capital costs, operational expertise requirements, safety considerations, and remote accessibility. This paper introduces an approach to address these obstacles by implementing a Virtual Reality (VR) platform for studying robot manipulators. The paper details the conceptual methodology, containing five domains: 3D Modelling, Application of Mechanics, VR Development, VR Integration, and Application Development. The methodology shows the creation of three VR applications focusing on distinct learning scenarios. The first application offers an overview of manipulators, while the second illustrates a specific operation (pick-and-place), providing insights into the combined function of links and joints. The third application allows users to interact with the manipulator, facilitating the execution of programming tasks. The paper concludes by outlining the benefits and the features of a VR manipulator over a physical robot manipulator. Then, it outlines the future enhancements, including developing a digital twin for the VR manipulator and a series of laboratory experiments.

  abstract={In the United Kingdom, industry accounts for roughly a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. The UK Government has set ambitious net-zero targets committed to the decarbonisation of heavy industry, and the Industrial Clusters mission aims to establish the world's first net-zero carbon industrial cluster by 2040. To reduce the energy costs and carbon footprint of industry, one of the most effective solutions is the use of digital tools enabling businesses to monitor and visualize their energy consumption in real-time. Due to recent advancements in industrial digitalization, many industrial sites already generate data, including energy monitoring data, with varying degrees of digital maturity. However, a major challenge with this data is a lack of commercial tools for modeling, predicting, and visualizing industrial manufacturing energy data for efficiency improvement and emissions reduction. This paper describes efforts in a recently funded project to develop a prototype flexible, industrial energy efficiency, and visualization profiling Toolbox (I-CAT). The toolbox embeds energy analytics and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities into an existing commercial SCADA platform for industrial manufacturing operations. This approach allows the creation of an energy Digital Twin. The paper describes requirements of the toolbox, and experimental analysis of the toolbox in a case study, an operational sawmill in Carlisle, UK. Data-driven modeling allows the creation of a predictive model of the energy consumption of the facility from a forecasted production schedule. Mean average modeling errors of less than 10% were obtained. The paper concludes by highlighting areas of future development work.},

  abstract={Online signature verification (OSV) is a standardized personal authentication scheme with wide social acceptance in critical real-time applications include access control, m-commerce, etc. Even though the current advances in Deep learning (DL) technologies catalysed state-of-the-art frameworks for challenging domains like computer vision, speech recognition, etc., the DL-based frameworks are voluminous with huge trainable parameters and are hard to deploy in real-time systems demanding faster inference. To adopt DL into OSV for improved performance, we propose an OSV framework made up of teacher-student collaborative knowledge distillation (TSKD) technique. A heavy Transformer based teacher is trained first and the teacher knowledge is distilled into a very lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based student. A well trained teacher network results in an efficient deep representative feature learning by the student and results in a performance improvement. In a thorough set of experiments with three popular and standard datasets, i.e., the MCYT-100, SUSIG, and SVC, TSOSVNet framework, with a CNN based student model requiring only 3266 trainable parameters results in an EER of 12.42% compared to the recent SOTA 13.38% by a model with 206277 parameters in skilled_01 category of MCYT-100 dataset. In comparison to cutting-edge CNN-based OSV models, the proposed TSOSVNet produced a state-of-the-art EER in the most of the test categories with an average of 90% lesser trainable parameters.},

  pages={1404-1414},
  abstract={Many practical applications require training of semantic segmentation models on unlabelled datasets and their execution on low-resource hardware. Distillation from a trained source model may represent a solution for the first but does not account for the different distribution of the training data. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques claim to solve the domain shift, but in most cases assume the availability of the source data or an accessible white-box source model, which in practical applications are often unavailable for commercial and/or safety reasons. In this paper, we investigate a more challenging setting in which a lightweight model has to be trained on a target unlabelled dataset for semantic segmentation, under the assumption that we have access only to black-box source model predictions. Our method, named CoRTe, consists of (i) a pseudo-labelling function that extracts reliable knowledge from the black-box source model using its relative confidence, (ii) a pseudo label refinement method to retain and enhance the novel information learned by the student model on the target data, and (iii) a consistent training of the model using the extracted pseudo labels. We benchmark CoRTe on two synthetic-to-real settings, demonstrating remarkable results when using black-box models to transfer knowledge on lightweight models for a target data distribution.},

  abstract={The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones, is expanding quickly across a wide range of industries, such as package delivery, defense, law enforcement, etc. UAVs equipped with machine learning (ML) capabilities can improve system performance by carrying out autonomous actions at the edge, which lowers the need for communication. A prominent area of research addresses the challenge of a UAV equipped with a pre-trained model adapting to rapidly evolving, previously unencountered situations in real-world applications. Such scenarios can arise in situations like emergency deployments of multiple drones with minimal setup time for initial training of the ML models. When the UAV is equipped with sensors that are less sophisticated than those used during the initial training phase, the probability of autonomous operation failure increases. This paper suggests using the Teacher-Student self-training architecture with federated ML capability for a situation involving several heterogeneous UAVs. In this work, we examine a UAV docking scenario where a UAV with a pre-trained model of a docking station is used to teach additional UAVs in real-time in order to show the applicability. The process is done in a distributed framework, where the Teacher and the Student nodes are updated with the newly trained model. The results of our experiments show that our proposed method can improve the performance of the entire system.},

  abstract={An efficient deep-detector image quality assessment (EDIQA) is proposed to address the need for an objective and efficient medical image quality assessment without requiring reference images or ground truth scores from expert radiologists. Existing methods encounter limitations in meeting diagnostic quality and computation efficiency, especially when reference images are unavailable. The proposed EDIQA leverages knowledge distillation in a two-stage training procedure, using a task-based image quality assessment (IQA) model and the modified deep-detector IQA (mD2IQA) as the teacher model and novel student model designed for effective learning. This approach enables the student model to compute image scores based on a task-based approach without complex signal insertion and multiple predictions, resulting in a speed improvement of over 1.6e + 4 times compared to the teacher model. A deep learning architecture is developed to allow the student model to learn hierarchical multi scale features of the image from low- to high-level semantic features. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed model across various modalities and anatomical parts, indicating a step toward a universal IQA metric in medical imaging.},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Nowadays, intensive interests are targeting the deep learning on edge precision health towards instantaneous disease measurements. However, edge inference usually has constrained computing resource, which poses a great challenge on running the heavy deep learning for real-time measurements. In this study, we propose to leverage a knowledge distillation methodology to enable ultra-efficient deep learning on edge. We take a special interest in Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based cardiac abnormality measurement. More specifically, we propose to train two deep learning models, including a heavy teacher model and a light-weight student model, and leverage the ‘soft target distribution’ learned by the teacher model to supervise the learning of the student model. So, the powerful teacher model can transfer learned knowledge to the student model and boost the latter’s accuracy. Further, to mitigate the vulnerability of the deep learning model under adversarial attacks, we further introduce preserving-robustness learning to the student model, without needing extra computing resources, through enhancing its loss function under adversarial perturbations. Our experiments on real-time heart disease measurement have demonstrated that, the learned lightweight student model, with a model reduction of 45x and under adversarial attacks, can still achieve comparable disease detection performance. The proposed robust knowledge distillation methodology has effectively enabled light-weight and secure cardiac measurement. Significance: This study is expected to contribute to on-edge deep learning-powered disease detection, for real-time, long term, and secured cardiac precision health.},

  abstract={Test certification is an important link during the market-oriented process of C-V2X (Cellular-Vehicle to Everything) technologies. The usual approach, on-road test scenario construction seldom regards the impact of VRU (Vulnerable Road Users) due to the V2P (Vehicle to Pedestrian) communication mode with no definite conclusion. With the development of V2P technologies, VRUs should be considered in test scenario design, and pedestrian-vehicle-oriented scenes are needed. In this paper, we use the genetic algorithm to reconstruct basic pedestrian-vehicle scenarios and use the K-means++ algorithm to sort them according to the critical factors and construct digital twin testing datasets. And after that, we propose a CNN-GRU model to analyze the spatiotemporal features of scenarios and identify the critical pedestrian-vehicle test scenarios. The experimental results show that the pedestrian-vehicle scenario identification precision of the proposed CNN-GRU model is better than that of other algorithms. Pedestrian-vehicle-oriented safety applications can be triggered by the identified scenarios, proving the proposed method’s effectiveness.},

  year={2023},

  pages={253-258},
  abstract={As deep learning technologies, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have advanced, object detection models have become more powerful. This has opened up new possibilities for using cameras to detect fire and smoke for fire warning purposes. However, the high computational demands of deep CNNs make them unsuitable for low computing power devices, which is a challenge for fire detection. A fire detection algorithm based on adaptive region decoupling knowledge distillation has been proposed to address this. Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique that transfers knowledge from a larger, more accurate teacher model to a smaller, less accurate student model. This allows the smaller model to achieve relatively high accuracy using fewer parameters and computational resources. In the proposed approach, the most informative region of the feature map is selected through adaptive region selection, and separate the foreground and background of this region, distilling them with different weights. This approach has been applied to state-of-the-art detectors, and experiments have been conducted on the D-fire dataset. The experiments demonstrate that this approach has improved the AP score from 37.9 to 38.9 for Gfocal with ResNet-50 while training each model for only 12 epochs, especially without incurring any additional cost. Additionally, the proposed approach has achieved similar AP scores as the teacher model but with lower model complexity, fewer parameters, and a faster detection speed of less than 50 milliseconds per image. Specifically, this approach addresses the challenge of deploying such models for fire detection and proposes a promising solution.},

  abstract={To support safety driving and various on-board services, efficient resource allocation is crucial for the promising implement of vehicle platooning in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The resource allocation of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications for vehicular platoons is studied in this paper. First, a multi-objective function is formulated to jointly optimize sub-band and power allocation to satisfy quality-of-service (QoS) in vehicular networks. With the advantage of dealing with complex decision-making problems in multi-agent systems, distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) stands out for resource allocation of vehicular networks. However, it faces the challenge of cooperation ageing when every agent is only learning from information of others to form a cooperation model in the training process. Considering the random and dynamic combination of vehicles in vehicle platooning, a tactic-interactive MADRL method named as TacNet is then proposed to improve the cooperation efficiency of multiple agents. In TacNet, the tactics of other agents will be encoded and transmitted through interactive communications among agents. In addition, with the development of vehicular edge computing (VEC), digital twin (DT) networks are constructed to assist offloading computation-intensive resource allocation tasks in vehicles to the edge. The superiority of the proposed method is verified through extensive simulation results, which refers to convergence and performance of satisfying diversified QoS requirements compared with state-of-the-art MADRL methods.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Massive high-quality annotated data is required by fully-supervised learning, which is difficult to obtain for image segmentation since the pixel-level annotation is expensive, especially for medical image segmentation tasks that need domain knowledge. As an alternative solution, semi-supervised learning (SSL) can effectively alleviate the dependence on the annotated samples by leveraging abundant unlabeled samples. Among the SSL methods, mean-teacher (MT) is the most popular one. However, in MT, teacher model’s weights are completely determined by student model’s weights, which will lead to the training bottleneck at the late training stages. Besides, only pixel-wise consistency is applied for unlabeled data, which ignores the category information and is susceptible to noise. In this paper, we propose a bilateral supervision network with bilateral exponential moving average (bilateral-EMA), named BSNet to overcome these issues. On the one hand, both the student and teacher models are trained on labeled data, and then their weights are updated with the bilateral-EMA, and thus the two models can learn from each other. On the other hand, pseudo labels are used to perform bilateral supervision for unlabeled data. Moreover, for enhancing the supervision, we adopt adversarial learning to enforce the network generate more reliable pseudo labels for unlabeled data. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets to evaluate the proposed BSNet, and results show that BSNet can improve the semi-supervised segmentation performance by a large margin and surpass other state-of-the-art SSL methods.},

  abstract={Accurate modeling of magnetic behaviors, such as the hysteresis loop and core loss, is critical in the design and optimization of power magnetic components. However, these behaviors can be significantly influenced by various factors, such as excitation waveforms and operating conditions, which makes their precise modeling challenging. Neural-network-based power magnetics modeling has emerged as an effective approach for capturing complicated multi-variable non-linearity. This paper uses transformer-based encoder-projector-decoder neural network models to study the material characteristics under ideal excitations, which cannot be done with traditional methods. The neural network model functions as a digital-twin of the original material database with over 10000x smaller data size (e.g., from 3.8 GB to 204 kB) while accurately and rapidly reproducing the material characteristics under complex operating conditions. An online platform – MagNet-AI – is developed as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of using neural networks as the digital-twins to study and compare power magnetics materials.},

  abstract={Nanogrids provide a redundant mode of operation when the grid power fails. Nanogrids use data communication networks to coordinate power and energy between distributed energy resources (DERs). Under the corner-case of simultaneous communication failure and electrical faults, it can be difficult for the energy storage system with grid-forming/grid-following capability to select the correct operational mode. This paper proposes the use of a digital twin to assist in minimizing the degradation on the nanogrid caused by loss of communication during islanded operation under electrical fault conditions. The structure of the digital twin is proposed, and the construction of a virtual twin is presented. The error vector produced by the difference between the physical twin and virtual twin is demonstrated in various fault conditions. Lastly, the paper presents a discussion of how the error vector could be used to make inferences about the nanogrid state and to choose actions during off-nominal communication.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT) models are computational models that can effectively represent different assets and processes in the manufacturing environment. Moreover, the DT models can support intelligent automation by integrating with the digital foundation and the data analytics provided by the cyber-physical system (CPS) in an industrial environment. To properly model a physical process, a DT model should be updated online to closely and timely model the underlying process and reduce modeling uncertainty in the CPS. However, most DT models are created offline and implemented online, which cannot be easily updated by using online data from heterogeneous product designs or manufacturing processes. This limitation arises from existing online learning methods, which are typically designed for identical structures, while real manufacturing CPS involves personalized designs and diverse processes. More importantly, there are limited samples for the same product design or manufacturing process due to manufacturing personalization, which slows down the online updating of DT models. In this article, the authors investigated online DT model updating based on data collected from different product designs and/or processes. The authors proposed a mutual active learning framework to identify informative samples from different designs or processes for online DT model updating. Specifically, by properly balancing the gradient-based features of the DT models and the similarity among these heterogeneous designs or processes, the proposed method can effectively query the most informative samples among heterogeneous processes to update the corresponding DT model in a timely manner. The advantages of the proposed method are illustrated by an engineering-driven statistical DT model for an additive manufacturing process (i.e., fused deposition modeling).},

  abstract={Copy detection patterns (CDP) present an efficient technique for product protection against counterfeiting. However, the complexity of studying CDP production variability often results in time-consuming and costly procedures, limiting CDP scalability. Recent advancements in computer modelling, notably the concept of a “digital twin” for printing-imaging channels, allow for enhanced scalability and the optimization of authentication systems. Yet, the development of an accurate digital twin is far from trivial. This paper extends previous research which modelled a printing-imaging channel using a machine learning-based digital twin for CDP. This model, built upon an information-theoretic framework known as “Turbo”, demonstrated superior performance over traditional generative models such as CycleGAN and pix2pix. However, the emerging field of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) presents a potential advancement in generative models due to its ability to stochastically model the inherent randomness of the printing-imaging process, and its impressive performance in image-to-image translation tasks. This study aims at comparing the capabilities of the Turbo framework and DDPM on the same CDP datasets, with the goal of establishing the real-world benefits of DDPM models for digital twin applications in CDP security. Furthermore, the paper seeks to evaluate the generative potential of the studied models in the context of mobile phone data acquisition. Despite the increased complexity of DDPM methods when compared to traditional approaches, our study highlights their advantages and explores their potential for future applications.},

Our work aims to investigate the performance of this technology in smaller-scale systems that generate less data. In this case study, we developed a ML-based DT of the mobility system, the omni wheels, of the Turtle soccer robots.

  abstract={The role of education is of paramount importance in influencing the cognitive development of future generations. This paper presents a novel IoT-based Behavioural Analysis (IoT -BA) Model for Smart Learning integrated with neural network technology. The Internet of Things (IoT) enables educational institutions to perform management tasks more quickly and risk- freely by analyzing organized data and acquiring insights from it to inform decisions. The significance of teaching college students in the self-directed application of effective learning strategies has evolved with various trending digital twin frameworks. The proposed IoT -BA model can collect the motion features and facial expressions of the students from the classroom video while attending classes through self-learning applications. The collected images can then be preprocessed using augmentation and a local binary pattern approach. This deep-preprocessed data has been passed to the deep learning algorithm convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained with the preprocessed data for classification. Spatiotemporal feature extraction and selection from the preprocessed data can be performed using the preprocessing algorithm principal component analysis (PCA). The student's attention level classification for the IoT -BA uses the CNN algorithm. This experimental research uses the real-time data collected by setting the classroom environment for model training and validation. The CNN model has been trained with the data collected from the environment using the simulation platform TensorFlow and performs five-cross-validation with the realistic data. The IoT -BA model can predict the student's attention level in the classroom based on the collected features from the classroom video. The simulation results of the CNN -based IoT -BA model showed better performance in terms of 96.42% classification accuracy and a minimal error rate of 1.82%.},

However, much attention has been paid to its entertainment and social functions. Considering the openness and interoperability of metaverses, the market of quality inspection promises explosive growth. In this paper, taking advantage of metaverses, we first propose the concept of Automated Quality Inspection (AutoQI), which performs integrated inspection covering the entire manufacturing process, including Quality of Materials, Quality of Manufacturing (QoM), Quality of Products, Quality of Processes (QoP), Quality of Systems, and Quality of Services (QoS). Based on the scenarios engineering theory, we discuss how to perform interactions between metaverses and the physical world for virtual design instruction and physical validation feedback. Then we introduce a bottomup inspection device development workflow with productivity tools offered by metaverses, making development more effective and efficient than ever. As the core of quality inspection, we propose Quality Transformers to complete detection task, while federated learning is integrated to regulate data sharing. In summary, we point out the development directions of quality inspection under metaverse tide.},

The Digital Twin is a software representation of a corresponding complex physical object.

Data are the central aspect for monitoring and representing the status of a physical object. Having access to well-formed data makes it possible to represent the salient features and characteristics of the physical object.

  abstract={While the industry is exploring the key drivers and future needs of 6G cellular communication systems, 6G research is in full swing, globally supported by large programs. As a result, many new technologies are being proposed. This could be noticed in various fora and publications that convey new visions for the verticals that 6G would serve and the key elements that could make this happen. New radio and optical wireless access technologies for 3D coverage, new waveforms, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), edge–cloud supported by AI, joint communication and sensing, optical fiber networks, nonterrestrial network (NTN) integration, new network architectures, trusted computing platforms, quantum communications, and digital twin provisioning systems are some of many technology enablers for 6G. However, 6G will support many more vertical industries. This requires defining a new model for network infrastructures that builds on 5G architectures and designs, especially private networks and open networking. This means that operating minor networks independently at their local domains and allowing separated domains to handle services without centralized management may become more mainstream. AI and ML will become important enablers for future network management and control. This segregation within the mobile network architecture allows AI-driven components to maximally utilize resources at their local domain. In addition, minor domains would be able to decompose service requests to reduce operational cost incurred by the network. This network modeling takes advantage of fully automated elements and services that could be onboarded upon user demand for more efficient networks that fully utilize resources in a cost-efficient manner. Therefore, operators and vendors need to work closely with network planning engineers and academia to bring such designs into reality.},

  abstract={With the growing maturity of the advanced edge-cloud collaboration and integrated sensing-communication-computing systems, edge intelligence has been envisioned as one of the enabling technologies for ubiquitous and latency-sensitive machine learning based services in future wireless systems. However, with the ever-growing scale of the edge-cloud systems as well as the rapid advances in future 6G technologies, there exists a critical issue that limits the deep penetration of future 6G enabled edge intelligence services, i.e., how to accurately evaluate the performance when leveraging the emerging yet pre-matured technologies, protocols, and algorithms into the existing systems. The recent advanced Digital Twin (DT) has been envisioned to provide a fault-tolerant and low-cost platform for accurately simulating and evaluating the emerging technologies, protocols, and algorithms, without causing any negative influence on the existing systems. The essence of DT aims at enabling a systematic and fully digitalized modeling systems that can produce accurate digital model of the corresponding physical identity in the DT-space. By simulating the digital models in the DT-space, DT can accurately and reliably predict and estimate the dynamics and evolutions of the physical networks during the entire life cycle, thus providing a timely and risk-free methodology for evaluating the performance when adopting the emerging yet pre-matured technologies, protocols, and algorithms for network management. Therefore, DT has been considered as an efficient scheme for addressing the challenging issue to 6G enabled edge intelligence, and thus has attracted lots of interests from both academia and industries. It is observed that DT and edge intelligence can benefit each other, which thus yields a deep convergence of themselves. On the one hand, the increasing network scale, complexity, and security risks of edge intelligence raise more challenges to the security and reliability. DT can accurately simulate and predict the performance of edge intelligence services and thus provide accurate benchmark references for edge services. On the other hand, to enable accurate mapping and real-time synchronization between the physical identifies and their digital models, DT necessitates massive sensing of the targeted physical identifies as well as the consequent data analytics and modeling. Moreover, efficient yet low-latency transmissions of the sensing data and the data analytics (e.g., the inference models) are required. 6G edge intelligence can naturally provide a solution to these requirements. Therefore, this special issue focuses on the convergence of DT and 6G enabled Edge Intelligence, from the perspectives of theories, algorithms, and applications.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is experiencing unimaginable fast booming with the popularization of end devices and advanced machine learning and data processing techniques. An increasing volume of data is being collected every single second to enable Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the Internet of Things (IoT). The explosion of data brings significant benefits to various intelligent industries to provide predictive services and research institutes to advance human knowledge in data-intensive fields. To make the best use of the collected data, various data mining techniques have been deployed to extract data patterns. In classic scenarios, the data collected from IoT devices is directly sent to cloud servers for processing using diverse methods such as training machine learning models. However, the network between cloud servers and massive end devices may not be stable due to irregular bursts of traffic, weather, etc. Therefore, autonomous data mining that is self-organized by a group of local devices to maintain ongoing and robust AI services plays a growing important role for critical IoT infrastructures. Privacy issues become more concerning in this scenario. The data transmitted via autonomous networks are publicly accessible by all internal participants, which increases the risk of exposure. Besides, data mining techniques may reveal sensitive information from the collected data. Various attacks, such as inference attacks, are emerging and evolving to breach sensitive data due to its great financial benefits. Motivated by this, it is essential to devise novel privacy-preserving autonomous data mining solutions for AIoT. In this Special Issue, we aim to gather state-of-art advances in privacy-preserving data mining and autonomous data processing solutions for AIoT. Topics include, but are not limited to, the following: • Privacy-preserving federated learning for AIoT • Differentially private machine learning for AIoT • Personalized privacy-preserving data mining • Decentralized machine learning paradigms for autonomous data mining using blockchain • AI-enhanced edge data mining for AIoT • AI and blockchain empowered privacy-preserving big data analytics for AIoT • Anomaly detection and inference attack defense for AIoT • Privacy protection measurement metrics • Zero trust architectures for privacy protection management • Privacy protection data mining and analysis via blockchain-enabled digital twin.},
