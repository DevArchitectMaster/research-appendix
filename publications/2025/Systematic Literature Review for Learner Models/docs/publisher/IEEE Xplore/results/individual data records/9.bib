  abstract={The Digital Twin Network (DTN) is a key enabling technology for efficient and intelligent network management in modern communication networks. Learning dynamic net-work behaviors at the flow granularity is a core element for realizing DTN with accurate network modelling. However, it is challenging due to the complexity of network architectures and the proliferation of emerging network applications. In this paper, we devise a Packet-Action Sequence Model to represent all possible packets behaviors in a unified way. Besides, we propose a novel and effective algorithm to assess whether the behavior pattern is time dependent or independent by using the temporal characteristics of packets in a network flow, so as to learn the key factors of packets that contribute to network behaviors. Based on two typical scenarios, i.e., packet caching and routing, the experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm can identify network behavior patterns and learn key factors affecting the behaviors with over 99 % accuracy.},

  title={Automatic Generation and Annotation of Object Segmentation Datasets Using Robotic Arm}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={000063-000068},
  abstract={Modern robot applications often rely on visual information to perform manipulation tasks in semi-structured environments. A common requirement for such systems is to detect objects in the scene and predict their pose either for building a map, for navigation, or for manipulation purposes. Predicting segmentation masks for the objects is usually helpful for accurate object localization. In robotic manipulation however, the objects of interest can often have complicated geometries or there can be several objects in the scene simultaneously. This makes the manual annotation of an object segmentation dataset especially challenging. In this paper, an automated annotation procedure for object segmentation datasets is presented. Our method uses an industrial robot arm and a camera mounted to the robot’s end effector to collect a set of images showing a scene from multiple viewpoints. Assuming that the end effector transformation and scene geometry are known with respect to the robot’s base frame, the object masks can be computed to each image using the projection model of the camera. Through a real-world implementation of the method, our study demonstrates the accuracy of our automated annotation including a genetic algorithm-based optimization of the camera intrinsic parameters and the transformation between the robot’s flange and the camera frame. Our results suggest, that the proposed automated dataset annotation can be a good alternative to manual labeling. The presented approach introduces a novel application of the digital twin paradigm extending the concept to the field of machine learning dataset generation.},

  abstract={Existing distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) solutions cannot handle highly aggregated data rates; thus, they are unsuitable for Internet service provider (ISP) core networks. This article proposes a digital twin-enabled intelligent DDoS detection mechanism using an online learning method for autonomous systems. Our contributions are three-fold: we first design a DDoS detection architecture based on the digital twin for ISP core networks. We implemented a Yet Another Next Generation (YANG) model and an automated feature selection (AutoFS) module to handle core network data. We used an online learning approach to update the model instantly and efficiently, improve the learning model quickly, and ensure accurate predictions. Finally, we reveal that our proposed solution successfully detects DDoS attacks and updates the feature selection method and learning model with a true classification rate of ninety-seven percent. Our proposed solution can estimate the attack within approximately fifteen minutes after the DDoS attack starts.},

  abstract={With the rise of Industry 4.0, businesses are increasingly turning to Machine Learning to leverage data for improving quality and productivity. However, one open challenge when embracing Machine Learning in this context is the integration of cloud infrastructures, as well as the heterogeneity of data, interfaces, and protocols in the production environment. To address this, we are developing a framework that aims to simplify the adoption of Machine Learning techniques for heterogeneous industrial automation systems. One of the core features of this framework is the ability to handle data about production devices – a scenario that is naturally suited to the use of Asset Administration Shells. However, the implementation of a system that uses Asset Administration Shells comes with its own set of challenges, such as the abstraction of details from users and the representation of device topologies. Thus, this paper introduces the concepts and implementation of a Metadata Manager component in the aforementioned framework that uses Asset Administration Shells as its basis. We further examine the Metadata Manager’s current structure with unit testing, derive planned extensions, and discuss future directions from the Industry 4.0 perspective.},

  abstract={Nowadays, the automation industry is undergoing many changes, manufactures must react to fast changing market demands and more individual customer requirements. Recept-based, Service-Oriented Architectures enable the efficient adaption of production processes to new operating conditions. However, to ensure production performance, service-oriented production should also be complemented by adequate scheduling approaches to guarantee critical performance factors. We present a Digital Twin-based approach that performs integrated process planning and scheduling for service-based production. For our approach, we have identified a common set of input data required for integrated process planning and scheduling. We use Deep-Q-Network, which is a deep Reinforcement Learning method, to derive near optimal schedules for production conditions described in Digital Twins. If an unforseen event happens during the production, our approach is able to adapt current schedules to the changed operating conditions. The case study shows that our approach is able to derive near optimal schedules for customized products and adapt its currents schedules for new orders with different production goals.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Since the introduction of the term Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in 2006, they came to a long way. CPS are now autonomous and networked systems of systems with state-space exceeding the capabilities of conventional risk analysis methods. Model-based fault injection methods allow assessment of a system’s fault tolerance not only during its design phase but also in the course of operation. This allows the evaluation of updates and new modules before deploying such changes to a real system. Such operational model-based fault injection on a system’s digital twin can ensure continuous safety throughout all system life cycles.Modern risk analysis tools and Machine Learning-based safety methods require vast amounts of representative input and training data. Such methods not only will require mountains of erroneous time-series data from a myriad of operational cycles, but also corresponding fault parameter labels. As the state space of the system component explodes in complexity, it becomes problematic to cover all possible component fault combinations. As such, only those faults that could lead to potential failures or increased risk scenarios are of interest for automated safety assessment methodologies. It is clear that an intelligent and effective model-based fault injection method is required for the operational safety assessment of industrial CPS.Recently we introduced a new model-based fault injection method implemented as a highly customizable Simulink block called FIBlock. It supports the model-based injection of typical faults of CPS components such as sensors, software, computing, and network hardware. In this paper, we proposed a Deep Learning-based approach for model-based fault injection called FIDGET. It extends the FIBlock with Deep Reinforcement Learning capabilities. We employed a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to train the Reinforcement Learning agent to per-form the automated search of fault parameters that yield the biggest system response. It allows automatic generation of labeled training data for further use in risk analysis tools or to train fault classifiers. The generated training data consists of errors that lead to the biggest response (i.e., disturbance) of the system.},

  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Currently, there are no commercial software systems to support the achievement of predefined surface roughness for newly machined parts. Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) programmers and machine operators rely on their experience to find the best trade-off between time and quality optimization.This paper presents a novel concept for predicting surface roughness based on real-time machining data, planning data, and quality measurements. By linking the data points of all the different sources to the respective manufacturing feature, like drilling or face milling, the data cleaning process is sped up significantly facilitating queries of machine learning applications.On the one hand, the relations derived from that machine learning model, e.g. a random forest, are integrated into a CAM planning software for parameter evaluation and automatic tool path optimization. On the other hand, the proposed surface roughness prediction algorithm is used in a live simulation to give machine operators immediate visual feedback on the produced finish to enhance precise feed rate adaption. Hence, a data-driven decision support system is to be developed which supports both inexperienced and experienced personnel at the planning and execution phase within the product life cycle.},

  abstract={Recently, smart system integration was identified as a key competence for optimizing machines and robots. However, when one wants to ’tune’ the entire production process a step further is necessary. We should evaluate performance indicators (e.g. energy and material consumption) over the whole machine life cycle in order to align the production with circular economy principles. To reach that target MBSE (model-based system engineering) should be covered by advanced digital twin approaches which allow continuous monitoring of machine performance, predict the failures and maintenance. Moreover, artificial intelligence and machine learning must be used to process big data sets gathered from the production lines. This paper identifies a common set of technologies and building blocks suitable to solve above mentioned problems for a large variety of industrial domains (semiconductor production, health-care robotics, CNC1 machining, high-speed packaging and others). It presents the first results of the large-scale IMOCO4.E2 project and shows the pathways for application of the technology on specific machines (so-called pilots). The authors believe the ideas presented could be inspiring also in other domains.},

  title={Towards Situative Risk Assessment for Industrial Mobile Robots}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Industrial mobile robots increasingly operate in dynamic and complex environments, resulting in risks that arise from the situation. Consequently, mobile robots need knowledge about the situative risk to make responsible decisions, e.g., when planning a trajectory. In this paper, the authors present a new approach to evaluate these situative risks at runtime. To compute the situative risk, the proposed approach uses multi-agent adversarial reinforcement learning. Unlike the usual approach that uses the self-play mechanism to harden the agents against disturbances, the approach directly uses the self-play to determine the confidence that the system can handle the current situation. Based on the evaluation of the strength of the perceived perturbations, the robot’s digital twin calibrates the action space of the adversarial agents. In this way, the adversarial agents represent the disturbances that are likely to occur. From the simulation results of the competing agents, the digital twin infers the confidence with which the system can handle the situation. In the event that the system cannot handle the situation and crashes in the simulation, the digital twin calculates the probability that the simulated scenario will occur in reality. To calculate this probability, the authors propose the method of game-theoretic event trees. Combining the probability of an accident scenario with the damage caused by the simulated hazard, the results of situative risk are obtained. The approach is qualitatively evaluated using a case study. In this case study, a industrial mobile robot called Robotino is considered that connects workstations in a matrix production system. The case study shows that the approach is promising.},

  abstract={Neural style transfer is a technique to transfer a style of an artistic image to another photorealistic image. The early development of this technique is exploiting the intermediate output of a deep learning model and utilizing it to optimize a targeted image. However, this technique needs some time to finish the process. An approach called knowledge distillation is widely used to optimize deep learning models so the speed of the model can be increased. Commonly, this technique is applied in a supervised task by providing a soft label as a target label for the student model. In this paper, a method is proposed to enable knowledge distillation happened in style transfer tasks. It is found this method is effective enough to make the style transfer process faster and give good results. In this paper also some discussion has been elaborated regarding the condition that is adequate to produce a good student model for style transfer tasks using knowledge distillation.},

  pages={112975-112988},
  abstract={Modern power systems have been expanding significantly including the integration of high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems, bringing a tremendous computational challenge to transient stability simulation for dynamic security assessment (DSA). In this work, a practical method for energy control center with the machine learning (ML) based synchronous generator model (SGM) and dynamic equivalent model (DEM) is proposed to reduce the computational burden of the traditional transient stability (TS) simulation. The proposed ML-based models are deployed on the field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for faster-than-real-time (FTRT) digital twin hardware emulation of the real power system. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) algorithm is adopted to train the SGM and DEM, where the training and testing datasets are obtained from the off-line simulation tool DSAToolsTM/TSAT®. A test system containing 15 ACTIVSg 500-bus systems interconnected by a 15-terminal DC grid is established for validating the accuracy of the proposed FTRT digital twin emulation platform. Due to the complexity of emulating large-scale AC-DC grid, multiple FPGA boards are applied, and a proper interface strategy is also proposed for data synchronization. As a result, the efficacy of the hardware emulation is demonstrated by two case studies, where an FTRT ratio of more than 684 is achieved by applying the GRU-SGM, while it reaches over 208 times for hybrid computational-ML based digital twin of AC-DC grid.},

  abstract={Recently Digital Twin (DT) has attracted much attention from researchers due to its capacity of system monitoring and health management to improve the reliability and availability of systems. This emerging technology has been considered a promising solution for various sectors to enhance the sustainability of business development. In general, DT relies on the living models for simulating system behaviors to monitor the systems or assets in production. Such models could be either mathematical/physics-based or data-driven, which are able to explain, predict, and describe system behaviors timely and accurately. Therefore, the machine learning-enabled modeling technology has become a powerful tool to develop such data-driven living models. However, data-driven models developed with supervised learning techniques carry a fatal deficiency: once the operational environments are changed, the model may hardly work well or even becomes useless due to the distribution shift between the training data and the new dataset. This paper attempts to address this issue by proposing to apply transfer learning techniques to develop lifetime robust living models for real-world DT systems. This paper presents a framework for developing lifetime data-driven living models. A case study, railway digital twin from our on-going research project along with the preliminary results, will be presented to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed modeling framework for digital twin.},

  abstract={One of the challenges in designing and operating systems composed of interacting components is validating that the emergent behavior of the system does not cause one or more components to migrate, over time, into a hazardous operating state. Many modern airline accidents can be characterized as Interaction Accidents – no component failed, but the interaction of components resulted in a hazardous state.Due to the dependence of time, emergent behavior cannot be evaluated by analysis of the design. In theory it can be evaluated by Digital-Twin agent-based simulations. However, the running these simulations to uncover rare event emergent hazardous states is prohibitive due to: (1) the combinatorics of initial states of each of the components, and the (2) combinatorics of the time dimension (i.e. small variations in timing can result in very different outcomes). Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLNN) have shown promise to capture the underlying combinatoric behavior as well as compress the time dimension.This paper demonstrates the application of DLNN to identify emergent behavior from components with hybrid moded/continuous behavior that plays out over time. DLNNs were trained and tested for three systems with increasing behavioral complexity. The DLNNs accurately were able to represent the time dependent behavior for which they were trained/tested. The DLNNs were also able to learn and predict emergent behavior for behaviors that were not included in the training/testing data (up to 63% of the missing cases). The implications of these results are discussed.},

As the Metaverse is becoming more and more apparent, a revolutionary change is expected in how we understand social relationships and consequently, education. It is therefore necessary for libraries to upgrade the services they provide to keep in line with the technological trends and be a part of this virtual revolution. We believe that the design and development of a Virtual Reality (VR) library can be the community and knowledge hub the society needs. In this paper we go through the process of creating a digital twin of the Limassol Municipal University Library, a landmark for the city of Limassol, by using photogrammetry and 3D modelling. By integrating the concept of digital twin, we developed a 3D platform where users have the perception that they are exhibiting the actual library. To do so, we conducted a perceptual study to understand the current usage of physical libraries, examine the users' experience in VR, and identify the requirements and expectations in the development of a virtual library counterpart. Following the suggestions and observations of our user study, we implemented five common case scenarios that demonstrate a potential use of a virtual library.},

  abstract={Online learning plays an increasingly important role in the field of education for its advantages of solid flexibility, openness, and richness. However, it also faces problems such as information explosion and resource overload, which makes it difficult for learners to obtain personalized learning resources timely and accurately and to complete learning efficiently. Learning resource recommendation is one of the critical countermeasures to solve the above problem. The current recommendation of learning resources is mainly based on the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation method and content-based recommendation method, which do not fully consider learners' characteristics resulting in unsatisfactory effects. A collaborative filtering recommendation method for online learning resources is proposed based on a traditional collaborative filtering algorithm and combined with research in the learner modeling community. This method incorporates learners' characteristics and learning behaviors into recommendation calculations making the recommended learning resources better match learners' individual needs. This study implemented the proposed method based on an influential online teachers' professional development community in China. The results show that the performance of recommendation is significantly higher than the traditional recommendation method.},

In this work we present the concept of a cognitive robotic cell that collects, stores and processes data in situ for enabling the control of a robotic arm in a production setting. The main features that characterise the robotic cell are embedded computing, open interfaces, and standards-based industrial communication with hardware peripherals and digital twin models for validation. An application of part classification is presented that uses the YOLOv4 image processing algorithm for real-time and online assessment that guides the control of an ABB IRB120C robotic arm. Results illustrate the feasibility and robustness of the approach in a real application. Quantitative evaluation underlines the performance of the implemented system.},

  abstract={Vision transformers (ViTs) have made remarkable achievements in various computer vision applications such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. Since the self-attention mechanism introduced by itself can model the relationship between all pixels of the input image, the performance of the ViTs model is significantly improved compared to the traditional CNN network. However, their storage, runtime memory and computing requirements hinder their deployment on edge devices. This paper proposes a ViT pruning method with knowledge distillation, which can prune the ViT model and avoid the performance loss of the model after pruning. Based on the idea that knowledge distillation can make the student model improve the performance of the model by learning the unique knowledge of the teacher model, the convolution neural network (CNN) which has the unique ability of parameter sharing and local receptive field is used as a teacher model to guide the training of the ViT model and enable the ViT model to obtain the same ability. In addition, some important parts may be cut during pruning, resulting in irreversible loss of model performance. To solve this problem, this paper designs the importance score learning module to guide the pruning work, and determines that the pruning work removes the unimportant parts of the model. Finally, this paper compares the pruned model with other methods in terms of accuracy, Floating Point Operations(FLOPs) and model parameters on ImageNet-1k.},

  abstract={In existing semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches, the contributions of labeled and unlabeled data points to the training objective are expressed as two separated terms for the respective sets. A single weight specifies how much the unlabeled samples contribute to the overall loss and is carefully scaled in the course of the training. In this work, we propose a SSL framework in which the contribution of each unlabeled sample is individually scaled based on the confidence generated by a teacher model. We demonstrate that our scaling mechanism enables the student model to efficiently learn from heavily interpolated and augmented samples and achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract={A dynamic adversarial adaptive bearing fault diagnosis method driven by a combination of simulation and data is proposed to solve the problem of low diagnostic accuracy of rolling bearings due to the scarcity of fault data samples and complex service conditions in real industrial scenarios. Firstly, a four-degree-of-freedom dynamics simulation model was proposed for the rapid generation of bearing fault characteristics with a well-defined time-frequency domain. Subsequently, the commonalities and differences between the measured data distribution and the dynamics simulation signal were explored. Finally, a dynamic adversarial adaptive network that can extract invariant features in the hidden domain and automatically align the distribution of data in the source domain of the simulation and the data to be diagnosed in the target domain is developed. A rolling bearing fault diagnosis simulation experiment was designed, which used the dynamic model to generate the simulated signal with label information and the measured signal without label information to train the neural network. The classification and recognition of unlabeled samples are completed. The results show that the simulated signals contain information on the characteristics of bearing faults, which can characterise real bearing data. Moreover, the proposed dynamic adversarial adaptive network can achieve more accurate fault diagnosis of bearings.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The European interconnected grid is an association of all transmission system operators from Europe and enables a stable grid frequency and high security of supply. Due to the increasing share of volatile, decentralised renewable energies and the promotion of electromobility, the grid operators of the transmission and distribution grids are facing new challenges among others in the operational management of the electrical grid. To be able to train future engineers and students for this challenging grid operation and to train employees of grid operators, practical, realistic experience is essential in addition to theoretical knowledge. Since incorrect switching operations on the real grid can have serious consequences, it is necessary to set up a simulation of a grid control station for this purpose. Current service providers train employees in special simulators. However, the use of these simulators is strictly limited to fixed dates. In addition, the participation of prospective engineers as students is often not accessible due to the high costs involved in theses training sessions. Therefore, this paper describes a grid control station in virtual reality. Real grids are represented as a digital twin and are integrated into the virtual reality control station. However, the coupling of these two components currently exists only as a concept but will be realised soon. The participants immerse into the virtual grid control station, perform switching actions in different scenarios, and experience the consequences of their actions to increase their practical knowledge in grid operations to face the future grid challenges. The VR grid control station is to be offered as an education opportunity in the field of power engineering at Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences.},

  abstract={The lack of digitization of asset inventories managed by an educational institution, generates that maintenance management is affected; since, technologies are currently very advanced and propose better solutions for the control of the maintenance of educational infrastructures, one of them is the “digital twin” that has much potential to contribute concerning the traditional. However, the education sectors do not update their asset management processes, since being a very new digital tool takes time and investment for its optimal implementation, which causes a lack of quantitative evidence on the application of digital methods and thus generates a little contribution to the implementation or feasibility of the same. That is why using a methodology called “facility management ”, which aims to use an innovative technology “digital twin” and thus generate a big change in the maintenance control of educational assets, to achieve this, it is necessary to compare a traditional inventory with a digital inventory using a digital twin, where maintenance management will be the common point. Given this, we used methodologies such as descriptive analysis where the traditional inventory is analyzed and the application of a digital inventory with the digital twin, there will also be the judgment of experts on the use of the digital twin, then a SWOT analysis and finally a comparative analysis of the inventories to demonstrate the viability.},

  abstract={Knowledge Distillation (KD) is well known as one of the methods of compressing deep learning models. It aims to train the student model so that the student model (compressed model) can imitate the output of the teacher model (original model). However, the output of the teacher model alone may not be sufficient to train the student model. To compensate for this, we propose a method called Intermediate-State Knowledge Distillation (ISKD). Unlike most of the knowledge distillation studies that have been conducted for computer vision tasks, the proposed method is applied to a time series model that predicts the life of a battery using NASA AMES dataset. As a result, our method reduced the error level of battery End-of-Life (EOL) cycle by up to 1.04% compared to the conventional distillation method. In addition, the number of parameters could be reduced and at the same time, there was an advantage in terms of latency.},

  pages={124685-124696},
  abstract={Electric Vehicles (EVs) reliance on batteries, which currently have lower energy and power densities than liquid fuels and are prone to aging and performance degradation over time, restricts their mainstream adoption. With applications like electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage, effective management of lithium-ion batteries is a vital enabler for a low-carbon future. Monitoring the battery’s condition of health and charge over the lifetime of an EV is, therefore, a highly pertinent issue. Battery Management Systems (BMS) are used during the operation of EVs to monitor, estimate and control battery states to ensure that batteries can function effectively and safely. Additionally, the materials composition, system design, and operating circumstances substantially impact a battery’s usable life, making it more challenging to govern and maintain battery systems. This work proposes the structure of a battery digital twin-based battery for the electronic vehicle, which has the potential to enhance BMS situational awareness greatly and enable the optimal functioning of battery storage units. Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence (AI) present an opportunity and offer. In this paper, a Digital Twin (DT) is proposed as a solution to the difficulty of onboard computation for the incremental State Of Health (SOH) and State Of Charge (SOC) by using Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) model and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to predict the state estimate for the EV battery. The battery’s condition has been determined by using the EKF, which can provide vital information for maintenance. First, the battery’s usable life can be extended with an accurate estimate of the SOC to continue; then a learning-based prediction approach to gauge the battery’s health state is suggested in order to increase battery life. A SOC model is frequently retrained to depict the effects of aging, and a SOH model is often performed to foretell the reduction in the highest battery capacity. According to a result, DT models are useful for managing batteries, and full life cycle statistics are important for planning the battery’s upgrade path.},

  abstract={In view of the problems that most load forecasting methods are difficult to achieve high-precision data processing in the process of power grid digitization, a digital power grid load forecasting method based on digital twin and improved GRU is proposed. Firstly, the digital power grid model is constructed based on the digital twin technology, and the operation mode of the digital twin power grid is introduced in detail. Then, the time convolution network (TCN) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) network are fused to design the GRU-TCN prediction model. The high-dimensional data features extracted by TCN are input into the GRU network for learning to enhance the model prediction performance. Finally, the GRU-TCN model is applied to the load forecasting of digital twin power grid, and the high-precision forecasting results are obtained. The experimental results based on the simulation platform show that the proposed method prediction results root mean square error is 28.428KW, and mean absolute percentage error values is 2.161%, which prediction effect is good.},

  abstract={In this paper, a hyperparameter tuning based Bayesian optimization of digital twins is carried out to diagnose various faults in grid connected inverters. As fault detection and diagnosis require very high precision, we channelize our efforts towards an online optimization of the digital twins, which, in turn, allows a flexible implementation with limited amount of data. As a result, the proposed framework not only becomes a practical solution for model versioning and deployment of digital twins design with limited data, but also allows integration of deep learning tools to improve the hyperparameter tuning capabilities. For classification performance assessment, we consider different fault cases in virtual synchronous generator (VSG) controlled grid-forming converters and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Our research outcomes reveal the increased accuracy and fidelity levels achieved by our digital twin design, overcoming the shortcomings of traditional hyperparameter tuning methods.},

  abstract={Due to the advancement of digital twin (DT) technology, Health 4.0 applications have become reality and starting to take roots. In this article, we focus on intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) which is a life-threatening emergency that needs immediate diagnosis and treatment. ICH is caused by bleeding inside the skull or brain. Radiologists typically examine computed tomography (CT) scans of the patients to determine the ICH and its subtype. But the manual assessment of the CT scan is a complex and time-consuming task. The existing pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models are state-of-the-art for ICH classification. However, they employ poor feature extraction techniques which hinder overall model performance. Furthermore, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality and use redundant and noisy features. The problem of imbalanced data is also crucial for achieving model generalization. This paper proposes a hybrid attention-based ResNet architecture for ICH detection and classification. An attention mechanism allows the model to focus on a specific region and extract relevant features. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction and redundant feature removal whereas deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) is used for resolving the class imbalance problem. The proposed model is evaluated using the dataset assembled during the Radiologist Society of North America (RSNA) ICH detection challenge 2019. The results show that our proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and F1-score. ICH classification achieved accuracies of 99.2%, 97.1%, 96.7%, 96.7% and 96.1%, for detecting epidural hemorrhage (EH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), subdural hemorrhage (SH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) subtypes respectively. The F1-score of 96.1% for EH subtype is also best when compared with the benchmark models.},

  abstract={Building modeling, specifically heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) load and equivalent energy storage calculations, represent a key focus for decarbonization of buildings and smart grid controls. Widely used white box models, due to their complexity, are too computationally intensive to be employed in high resolution distributed energy resources (DER) platforms without simulation time delays. In this paper, an ultra-fast one-minute resolution Hybrid Machine Learning Model (HMLM) is proposed as part of a novel procedure to replicate white box models as an alternative to wide spread experimental big data collection. Synthetic output data from experimentally calibrated EnergyPlus models for three existing smart homes managed by the Tennessee Valley Authority is used. The HMLM employs combined k-means clustering and multiple linear regression (MLR) models to predict minutely HVAC power with satisfactory nRMSE error of less than 10% across an entire year test set. An approach is provided to characterize HVAC systems through the newly proposed hybrid model as a generalized storage (GES) device suitable for DER control and event types in accordance with the Communication Technology Association (CTA) 2045 standard and Energy Star metrics such as “energy take”, currently developed by industry, to unify household appliance controls.},

  abstract={Deep reinforcement learning achieves super-human performances at the cost of millions of non-optimal interactions with environments. Ideally, a well trained deep reinforcement learning algorithm should be robust to unseen cases or unseen tasks with limited data. This paper proposes a new meta reinforcement learning algorithm with the Hebbian learning algorithm. According to the neuroscientific theory, Hebbian learning mimics the learning behaviours of the human brain. Neurons are activated repeatedly, and new neural networks are built with newly formed connections. Researchers have proved that compared with deep reinforcement learning, Hebbian learning can obtain the near-optimal solutions within short training iterations. In this paper, we use a teacher-student learning architecture. In the teacher model, the Hebbian learning model is trained with an evolutionary strategy while the student model is a deep reinforcement learning model trained with modified training procedures. Experiments prove that our proposed algorithm overwhelms the performances of the Hebbian learning algorithm and the original deep reinforcement learning vastly. Besides, with strong inductive biases introduced by learned knowledge from subtasks, the data efficiency of deep reinforcement learning is significantly boosted. Moreover, we set the target task and subtasks different primarily to prove the robustness of Hebbian learning as the teacher model. Experiments prove that this proposed meta reinforcement learning algorithm could boost data efficiency largely.},

  abstract={Demand flexibility management, often by means of Demand Response (DR), can significantly enhance the stability of the electric grid and reduce the investment cost for infrastructure upgrades in case of dynamic energy mix with renewable sources. However, uncertainty in the consumer response to the DR signals may disrupt this goal. In this paper, we deal with the optimal management of the flexibility offered by residential users under uncertainty. We develop a probabilistic user model to account for the uncertainty in the actual provision of the flexibility by a user in conjunction with incentives' offered thereto, which we subsequently introduce in the Demand Response (DR) targeting process. We consider a suitable optimization framework to enable flexibility maximization and budget minimization as separate single-objective expressions with the appropriate constraints. We define representative problems and solve them numerically for a wide range of user parameters, in order to illustrate the applicability and accuracy of our method, and to extract valuable insights. Finally, we develop techniques to resolve practical issues and to enable real-world implementation of the proposed scheme in pilot sites; namely, a mathematical expression to estimate the confidence intervals of the attained flexibility and a learning algorithm for extracting the individual user parameters according to their participation patterns.},

  abstract={Anomaly detection models for network flow based on machine learning have poor detection performance under extremely unbalanced training data conditions, and also have slow detection speed and large resource consumption when deploying on network edge devices. Embedding multi-teacher knowledge distillation (mKD) in anomaly detection can transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models to a single model. Inspired by this, we proposed a state-of-the-art model, mKDNAD, to improve detection performance. mKDNAD mine and integrate the knowledge of one-dimensional sequence and two-dimensional image implicit in network flow to improve the detection accuracy of small sample classes. The multi-teacher knowledge distillation method guides the train of the student model, thus speeding up the model’s detection speed and reducing the number of model parameters. Experiments in the CICIDS2017 dataset verify the improvements of our method in the detection speed and the detection accuracy in dealing with the small sample classes.},

  abstract={We present a framework that lets a service provider achieve end-to-end management objectives under varying load. Dynamic control actions are performed by a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. Our work includes experimentation and evaluation on a laboratory testbed where we have implemented basic information services on a service mesh supported by the Istio and Kubernetes platforms. We investigate different management objectives that include end-to-end delay bounds on service requests, throughput objectives, and service differentiation. These objectives are mapped onto reward functions that an RL agent learns to optimize, by executing control actions, namely, request routing and request blocking. We compute the control policies not on the testbed, but in a simulator, which speeds up the learning process by orders of magnitude. In our approach, the system model is learned on the testbed; it is then used to instantiate the simulator, which produces near-optimal control policies for various management objectives. The learned policies are then evaluated on the testbed using unseen load patterns.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-13},
  abstract={With the massive popularization of e-learning, collaborative learning via learning teams has become indispensable to enhancing the learning efficiency and learning quality of overall learners. The team leader usually plays a key role in collaborative learning. However, the existing research ignores the key characteristics of learners and constraints relevant to e-learners when identifying appropriate team leaders and compatible members. A novel collaborative optimization approach to learning team formation is proposed based on a refined learner model and the environments—classes, agents, roles, groups, and objects (E-CARGO) model. With the proposed approach, a learner is modeled by combining 5-D characteristics (i.e., cognitive ability, leadership, sociability, learning style, and personality) and three types of constraints (e.g., conflicts, genders, and the number of members), and an assessment mechanism is designed to measure the comprehensive abilities of learners for identifying an ideal team leader and selecting the team members for a team. By innovatively introducing the role-based collaboration theory and E-CARGO model, the leader-centered learning team formation problem is formalized as a collaborative optimization problem. The mathematical model and the constraint relations are established for this problem, which is solved based on the IBM CPLEX package. Finally, a case study and experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is efficient and feasible, in favor of improving the satisfaction degree of learners.},

  year={2022},

  abstract={This paper proposes to use a digital twin of a dynamical system directly for optimization-based control. It proposes an algorithm based on an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to solve optimization-based control problems, where the system dynamics is encoded in the digital twin. The UKF-based algorithm uses simulations of a digital twin directly to optimize the control policy and does not require gradients to be computed―making it suitable for differential-algebraic constraints, where gradients may be inaccessible. The proposed UKF-based algorithm does not require explicit knowledge of the internal model of the digital twin, nor the control map; that is, it is a purely simulation data-driven approach. The main advantage is that a high-precision simulation-oriented digital twin can approximate the physical dynamical system more accurately than an analytical control-oriented model and thus, can improve the performance of the controller. The digital twin-based optimal control approach is evaluated on two case studies. First, a pendulum on a cart is optimized to swing up and stabilize. Second, a crane controller is optimized to avoid oscillations of the load.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Over the last years, the engine calibration task has mostly been conducted based on the engineers’ knowledge. As a result, considering the complexity of modern engines, finding the most suitable configuration for each situation has become an impractical and expensive task. Apart from causing engines to be produced with inadequate calibration configuration, it can also decrease the lifespan of their components, degrading their efficiency. This paper proposes a machine learning-based digital twin model for pressure prediction in a fuel injection system, split into two steps. First, we extract statistical engine features based on a predefined time window to represent the engine behavior over time. Second, a digital twin implemented through a machine learning model is used to predict pressure levels in the fuel injection system. As a result, the predicted values can be used to assist the engine common rail system module in avoiding undesired engine states. Experiments performed on a new dataset, built over a real diesel-based engine, consisting of 208 features and over 1.3 million instances, have shown the feasibility of our proposal. The proposed scheme can predict in an advance time of 0.1 seconds the pressure levels for a fuel injection system with only 0.057 RMSE. Moreover, it increases its error rate by only 10.6% if a 0.5-second time advance is required.},

  abstract={The complete life cycle management of complex equipment is seen as critical to the smart transformation and upgrading of today’s industrial industry. In recent years, digital twin (DT) technology and machine learning (ML) have arisen as emerging technologies. Developing technologies like DT technology and ML in entire battery life cycle management may make each stage of the life cycle more predictable and proactive. We propose a hybrid DT model based on ML that can enhance the performance of an existing DT mathematical model formulated to simulate lithium-ion battery deterioration behavior using DT technology. Firstly, we develop a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based model to forecast the error term of battery capacity enumerated for each charge and discharge cycle from the existing DT model. In this work, we use 18,650 lithium-ion battery discharge data from NASA Ames’ prognostics data repository as our experimental data. The LSTM model is configured with Adam optimizer and the mean absolute error (MAE) loss function. The early stopping criterion is also employed as a regularization technique to overcome model overfitting. Secondly, we develop our proposed hybrid DT by integrating both the existing DT and the LSTM model. Thirdly, we formulate an empirical mathematical model, which allows us to better replicate behavior of battery degradation of any lithium-ion battery. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid DT in terms of the MAE metric. Compared with the existing model, our proposed model reduces the error of battery capacity during the entire degradation period by 68.42%.},

  abstract={Digital twin and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are considered key enablers for Industry 4.0 and sustainable intelligent manufacturing. The usage of digital twins in manufacturing processes leads to an enhancement in process understanding due to the continuous processing and evaluation of production data. Hence, when properly implemented, it empowers the ability to increase the agility, traceability, and resilience of production systems. Despite these merits, the scalability and fidelity of digital twins at the manufacturing field level are limited by heterogeneous data sources as well as modeling uncertainties, e.g., due to coarse approximation and imprecise parameter identification. This study proposes a novel approach to overcome these deficiencies by exploiting machine learning on aggregated data throughout the product development process. A procedure is established to contextualize metadata sources from the construction, planning, manufacturing, and quality stages into a quality feature-based digital thread. On this basis, a hybrid approach for quantifying modeling uncertainties across the model chain is developed by incorporating the production domain knowledge into AI techniques. As a result, the digital twin takes into account disturbances from the physical manufacturing environment and estimates the reliability of the modeled outcomes. An exemplary implementation of this concept is demonstrated by using a cutting-edge digital process twin for machining quality monitoring.},

  abstract={The Artificial Agent's ability to enhance knowledge incrementally for new data is challenging in class incremental learning because of catastrophic forgetting in which new classes make the trained model quickly forget old classes knowledge. Knowledge distilling techniques and keeping subset of data from the old classes have been proposed to revamp models to accommodate new classes. These techniques allow models to sustain their knowledge without forgetting everything they already know but somewhat alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem. In this study we propose class incremental learning using bi-distillation (CILBD) method that effectively learn not only the classes of the new data but also previously learned classes. The proposed architecture uses knowledge distillation in such a way that the student model directly learns knowledge from two teacher model and thus alleviate the forgetting of the old class. Our experiments on the iCIFAR-100 dataset showed that the proposed method is more accurate at classifying, forgets less, and works better than state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of modeling a printing-imaging channel built on a machine learning approach a.k.a. digital twin for anti-counterfeiting applications based on copy detection patterns (CDP). The digital twin is formulated on an information-theoretic framework called Turbo that uses variational approximations of mutual information developed for both encoder and decoder in two-directional information passage. The proposed model generalizes several state-of-the-art architectures such as adversarial autoencoder (AAE) [1], CycleGAN [2] and adversarial latent space auto-encoder (ALAE) [3]. This model can be applied to any type of printing and imaging and it only requires training data consisting of digital templates or artworks that are sent to a printing device and data acquired by an imaging device. Moreover, these data can be paired, unpaired or hybrid paired-unpaired which makes the proposed architecture very flexible and scalable to many practical setups. We demonstrate the impact of various architectural factors, metrics and discriminators on the overall system performance in the task of generation/prediction of printed CDP from their digital counterparts and vice versa. We also compare the proposed system with several state-of-the-art methods used for image-to-image translation applications. The code and extended results of the simulation are publicly available1.},

Combining immersive technologies like mixed reality with robotics education leads a promising path to broaden the access to fundamental knowledge of industrial robotics. As high demands are placed on teaching complex topics like coordinate transformation in six degrees of freedom, which is crucial to understand for operating a six-axes industrial robot, a more intuitive and easier access to robotics must be ensured. Based on this, the aim of this work is to contribute facilitating the use of a mixed reality based digital twin platform for robotics education. To this end, a combined system of desktop robotics and mixed reality is to be expanded and investigated for entry into robotics courses.

To examine the model’s suitability for anomaly detection, we execute several simulations of fault conditions. Results show that the model can successfully predict normal operations as well as identify faults and cyber-attacks. There is a negligible drop in performance on the edge device, when compared to executing the model on a personal computer, but it remains suitable for the application.},

  abstract={Electrical cables within nuclear power plants (NPPs) are critical components required for power, control, and instrumentation systems which may be exposed to stressors, such as elevated temperatures and gamma radiation. Such stressors can lead to a reduction in the remaining useful life of electrical cables, jeopardizing the safety of NPP systems. To evaluate the effect of stressors on the degradation of electrical cables, electrical reflectometry methods are commonly employed. Frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) is a non-destructive electrical reflectometry method that uses transmission line theory to detect degradation or impedance changes within electrical cables. However, in most cases FDR is only applied to de-energized cables, limiting the application in NPPs as the cable system must be taken offline. In this work, we explore the development of an FDR digital twin to predict the degradation of an electrical cable exposed to elevated temperature, which is expected to reduce the need for offline FDR. A 3-conductor low-voltage electrical cable was selected for evaluation of the digital twin. The fully three-dimensional digital twin was developed in COMSOL using the radio frequency module. A cable length of 30-m and frequency bandwidth of 400 MHz was selected to mimic real-world application of FDR. Over a 1-m region, the permittivity of the insulation was varied by up to 20% to model thermal degradation. The results demonstrate accurate detection of the insulation damage region, supporting further investigation of the FDR digital twin using real-world data and machine learning for predictive damage estimation or remaining lifetime.},

  abstract={Obstacle detection is a fundamental capability of an autonomous maritime surface vessel (AMSV). State-of-the-art obstacle detection algorithms are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While CNNs provide higher detection accuracy and fast detection speed, they require enormous amounts of data for their training. In particular, the availability of domain-specific datasets is a challenge for obstacle detection. The difficulty in conducting onsite experiments limits the collection of maritime datasets. Owing to the logistic cost of conducting on-site operations, simulation tools provide a safe and cost-efficient alternative for data collection. In this work, we introduce SimuShips, a publicly available simulation-based dataset for maritime environments. Our dataset consists of 9471 high-resolution (1920x1080) images which include a wide range of obstacle types, atmospheric and illumination conditions along with occlusion, scale and visible proportion variations. We provide annotations in the form of bounding boxes. In addition, we conduct experiments with YOLOv5 to test the viability of simulation data. Our experiments indicate that the combination of real and simulated images improves the recall for all classes by 2.9%.},

  abstract={With the ever increasing demands of resource-hungry applications, computational tasks tend to be offloaded to edge servers for execution. However, most of the existing works on edge computing integrated with cloud computing ignore the additional computational resources of end devices and neighboring edge servers. Hierarchical task offloading allows more flexible distribution of computation loads among devices, edges, and the cloud hence further improving the quality of the computation experience. In this paper, a device-edge-cloud collaboration framework (DECHO) for hierarchical task offloading is developed, which learns to explore all available resources to improve offloading performance in a decentralized manner. Furthermore, an experimental prototype of DECHO is demonstrated. The experimental results present the task execution efficiency performance, which validates the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Digital twins, which are representatives of assets in this virtual world, play an important role to connect this environment to the actual world. Therefore, translating problematic assets, objects, and disease like cancers to this cyber world provide patients with this opportunity to benefit from its advantages. This study aims to conceptualize an approach to how machine learning (ML) can realize real-time and robust digital twins of cancers to be used in the Metaverse for diagnosis and treatment. While there are a large number of ML methods, which have advantages based on the various types of healthcare data, four classic ML techniques, including ML linear regression (ML LR), decision tree regression (DTR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Gradient Boosting Algorithm (GBA), have been employed to implement the main part of this approach in this research. Moreover, a comprehensive conceptual framework of the ML digital twinning method has been presented to illustrate the process of digital twining cancers with different medical data.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={897-902},
  abstract={The traditional unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, especially semantic segmentation, which requires high cost of pixel-wise annotations. However, the final performance of UDA method is still far behind that of supervised learning due to the lack of annotations. Researchers introduce the semi-supervised learning (SSL) and propose a more practical setting, semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA), that is, having labeled source domain data and a small number of labeled target domain data. To address the inter-domain gap, current researches focus on domain alignment by mixing annotated data from two domains, but we argue that adapting the target domain data distribution through model transfer is a better solution. In this paper, we propose a two-stage SSDA framework based on this assumption. Firstly, we adapt the model from the source domain to the labeled dataset in the target domain. To verify the assumption, we choose a basic transfer mode: finetuning. Then, to align the labeled subspace and the unlabeled subspace of the target domain, we choose teacher-student model with class-level data augmentation as the basis to realize online self-training. We also provide a deformation to solve overfitting on the target domain with a small number of annotated data. Extensive experiments on two synthetic-to-real benchmarks have demonstrated the correctness of our idea and the effectiveness of our method. In most SSDA scenarios, our approach can achieve supervised performance or even better.},

  abstract={Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful strategy for making a flexible task-oriented dialog agent, but it is weak in learning speed. Deep Dyna-Q augments the agent's experience to improve the learning efficiency by internally simulating the user's behavior. It uses a deep neural network (DNN) based learnable user model to predict user action, reward, and dialog termination from the dialog state and the agent's action. However, it still needs many agent-user interactions to train the user model. We propose a DNN-Rule hybrid user model for Dyna-Q, where the DNN only simulates the user action. Instead, a rule-based function infers the reward and the dialog termination. We also investigate the training with rollout to further enhance the learning efficiency. Experiments on a movie-ticket booking task demonstrate that our approach significantly improves learning efficiency.},

  abstract={In our contribution, we consider how the Digital Twin of the production system can be combined with Artificial Intelligence methods. The result of these considerations should be a hybrid production management system, which can be used for decision support as well as for self-control. On the one hand, the Digital Twin is providing information and simulation for the optimal decision-making to the decision support system (human interaction). On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence is taking over some elements and tasks with automatic control (independent of human interaction). If the result is out of tolerance or if a random sample of the result is audited, the decision support system is validating the Artificial Intelligence result for execution (by human interaction). The hybrid production management system is to be used to control production processes and generates learning effects. The extension by methods of Artificial Intelligence opens possibilities to process and to master certain tasks independently of human interaction. The presented approach should relieve and support decision makers in production. By performing various actions automatically and achieving partial auto-control, the reactivity of linked processes can increase. The provision of decisive information favors decision quality and time-effectiveness.},

The digital twin is intended to adapt to the organization but also to enhance it by including missing information flows. This paper presents the agent model chosen and inspired from reinforcement learning and how it allowed to identify these missing flows.

  volume={1},
  number={},
  pages={252-257},
  abstract={Electronic components (EC) detection is relevant for Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing, quality inspection, and assurance (cyber-security). Moreover, at end-of-life electronic devices, the PCBs become Waste PCBs (WPCBs), the primary source of high-value materials in electronic waste. However, the recycling process is challenging because of the WPCB’s high composition diversity. EC detection in WPCBs can reduce the uncertainty about WPCBs composition and help select a better recycling process. Nevertheless, large fully-annotated datasets for the PCB domain are available at a high cost. For WPCBs, there is only one publicly available dataset, the PCB-DSLR, and it is partially labeled. As for PCBs, the FICS-PCB dataset is available. However, it contains images of modern and clean PCBs, all in good condition, while the first has broken and dirty parts. Thus, we propose a self-training strategy for object detection algorithms without needing a fully labeled dataset. In the strategy, the YOLOv5 model is used to detect the eight types of electronic components present in FICS-PCB in PCB-DSLR, which initially has labels only for integrated circuits. The process occurs through the interaction between a teacher model, trained with the FICSPCB data, and a student model, which is trained by joining the FICS-PCB data and the teacher-generated labels for PCB-DSLR. The results show that the student model performs better in the electronic components detection task, obtaining greater precision and sensitivity when compared to the teacher model. Since we are dealing with partially labeled data, we provide a low-dimensional representation of the detections of both models using t-SNE.},

  year={2022},

  number={},
  pages={1-12},
  abstract={Due to the partial observability and communication constraints in many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks, centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) has become one of the most widely used MARL paradigms. In CTDE, centralized information is dedicated to learning the allocation of the team reward with a mixing network, while the learning of individual Q-values is usually based on local observations. The insufficient utility of global observation will degrade performance in challenging environments. To this end, this work proposes a novel Centralized Teacher with Decentralized Student (CTDS) framework, which consists of a teacher model and a student model. Specifically, the teacher model allocates the team reward by learning individual Q-values conditioned on global observation, while the student model utilizes the partial observations to approximate the Q-values estimated by the teacher model. In this way, CTDS balances the full utilization of global observation during training and the feasibility of decentralized execution for online inference. Our CTDS framework is generic, which is ready to be applied upon existing CTDE methods to boost their performance. We conduct experiments on a challenging set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks to test the effectiveness of our method and the results show that CTDS outperforms the existing value-based MARL methods.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-13},
  abstract={In the control of complex systems, we observe two diametrical trends: model-based control derived from digital twins, and model-free control through AI. There are also attempts to bridge the gap between the two by incorporating learning-based AI algorithms into digital twins to mitigate mismatches between the digital twin model and the physical system. One of the most straightforward approaches to this is direct input adaptation. In this paper, we ask whether it is useful to employ a generic learning algorithm in such a setting, and our conclusion is “not very”. We denote an algorithm to be more useful than another algorithm based on three aspects: 1) it requires fewer data samples to reach a desired minimal performance, 2) it achieves better performance for a reasonable number of data samples, and 3) it accumulates less regret. In our evaluation, we randomly sample problems from an industrially relevant geometry assurance context and measure the aforementioned performance indicators of 16 different algorithms. Our conclusion is that blackbox optimization algorithms, designed to leverage specific properties of the problem, generally perform better than generic learning algorithms, once again finding that “there is no free lunch”. Note to Practitioners—Digital twins have the potential to improve productivity and quality in complex systems such as manufacturing systems. Their impact on system performance hinges on the accuracy of their digital models around the system’s operating points. Difficult to measure phenomena, such as wear and tear of equipment, however, may cause a mismatch between the digital twin model and the physical system. In this paper, we formalize this problem and compare 16 potential solution strategies under practical aspects. We argue that readily available off-the-shelf blackbox optimization algorithms may prove more useful for this problem, than more recent learning-based approaches. Specifically, gradient-based algorithms will perform best in systems with high-dimensional, continuous, and non-linear performance functions – even in the presence of white measurement noise.},

We will review the different software optimization techniques used to compress neural networks to their deployable forms.

  abstract={Relevant today is the digitalization of industrial enterprises, which is an evolutionary continuation of the introduction of MES/MOM. At the same time, an important role is played by the construction of mathematical models for various purposes, which are the main component of the Digital Twin development. Digital Twin provides a new philosophy for conducting enterprise production processes based on these models, which is aimed at improving the efficiency of both individual sectors and the enterprise as a whole. To increase the profit of the enterprise, it is necessary to ensure the planned productivity of technological processes, the final indicator of which is the yield of sugar. Taking into account that a significant number of material flows operate at the enterprise, only production flows with which the operator-technologist works are singled out in the work. The selected flows, based on expert assessments, were assigned weighted values of the impact on the overall performance of the sugar production. This made it possible to build a mathematical model that predicts the yield of sugar from input flows. The structure and parameters of this model are determined by machine learning methods. This is a feed-forward neural network MLP 7-23-23-1, which provides forecast accuracy with an error of less than 1%. The model can be used to model, correct, and predict the process conditions of an enterprise, which will increase the overall productivity of the sugar factory.},

  abstract={With advancements in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), sensors, and computing resources, several cities across the world are investing in the development of smart/connected corridors. These corridors are being equipped with advanced sensors that provide real-time, high-resolution data from the corridor and enable vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. The objective of this study is to optimize signal timings for one such smart corridor – MLK Smart Corridor – in Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA with respect to fuel and energy consumption (represented by Fuel Consumption Intersection Control Performance Index, EcoPI, that determines the excess fuel consumption due to stops and delays caused by traffic controllers).},

  abstract={Greenhouse horticulture production is associated with high uncertainty and a long learning process due to its high dependency on the outdoor & indoor environment and plant types. Digital Twin (DT) technology enables a faster understanding of greenhouse horticulture facilities, obtaining insight into the production process flow and investigating the consequences of production decisions. However, no digital twin has been developed in this field due to the complexity of greenhouse production. Therefore, this paper presents a case study of a DT development for a Danish greenhouse production flow using multi-method modeling and multi-agent simulation. The results show that the developed DT can accurately represent the greenhouse production process and estimate the plant growth state with an absolute error of 0.31 days compared to the observed production. Furthermore, the developed DT can accurately predict deviations to the plant growth state corresponding to previously observed behavior at the facility. To capture the greenhouse production process flow at the top-level greenhouse DT agent, the underlying physical agents developed included: compartments, growth climate, conveyors, staff, tables, plants, soil machine, table loading, and packing station as well as the packing station. Lastly, the developed DT method supports agent re-usability for other case studies.},

Then based on this behavior, we propose a weight-loss pair-based training framework called REVAL to help decrease overfitting and increase the performance of the student model by using a supervisor model to learn the trajectories of weight updates of the student model. We conduct experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR-100 datasets with naive neural networks and show that we can improve the model classification performance with such simple network structures and training trajectories.

  abstract={Accurate prediction of coefficient of performance (COP) in refrigerant system is beneficial to the overall system performance evaluation and dynamic operation optimization. In this paper, a digital twin model of COP prediction in refrigeration system based on combined machine learning method is proposed. Firstly, several influencing factors are selected guided by the mechanism knowledge, and the correlation coefficients between impact factors and COP value are calculated to further verify their importance in COP prediction. Secondly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) with intrinsic weight optimization are used to capture the characteristics between the influencing factors and COP, while the long short term memory (LSTM) method is used to capture the characteristics of the time series data. Meanwhile, the weights of the CNN, LSTM and MLP methods are optimized in real time by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to minimize the difference between the COP value of physical system and the predicted COP value of digital twin model to realize online self-update. Finally, simulation results show that the MAE, MAPE and RMSE obtained by the proposed method are respectively 7.01 %, 1.71% and 0.08% lower than those obtained by CNN method, 0.92%, 0.24% and 0.01% lower than those obtained by LSTM method, and 2.41%, 0.58% and 0.02% lower than those obtained by MLP method, which have proved that the prediction result of proposed digital twin model for COP prediction is more accurate.},

  abstract={Compared to conventional engine-based powertrains, electrified powertrain exhibit increased energy efficiency and reduced emissions, making electrification a key goal for the automotive industry. For a vehicle with hybrid energy storage system, its performance and lifespan are substantially affected by the energy management system. Reinforcement learning-based methods are gaining popularity in vehicle energy management, but most of the literature in this area focus on pure simulation while hardware implementation is still limited. This paper introduces the digital twin methodology to enhance the Q-learning-based energy management system for battery and ultracapacitor electric vehicles. The digital twin model can exploit the bilateral interdependency between the virtual model and the actual system, which improves the control performance of the energy management system. The physical model is established based on a hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform. In addition, battery degradation is also considered for prolonging the battery lifespan to reduce the operating cost. The validation results of the trained reinforcement learning agent illustrate that the digital twin-enhanced Q-learning energy management system improves the energy efficiency by 4.36% and the battery degradation is reduced by 25.28%.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a digital twin (DT)-assisted adaptive video streaming scheme to enhance personalized quality-of-experience (PQoE). Since PQoE models are user-specific and time-varying, existing schemes based on universal and time-invariant PQoE models may suffer from performance degradation. To address this issue, we first propose a DT-assisted PQoE model construction method to obtain accurate user-specific PQoE models. Specifically, user DTs (UDTs) are respectively constructed for individual users, which can acquire and utilize users' data to accurately tune PQoE model parameters in real time. Next, given the obtained PQoE models, we formulate a resource management problem to maximize the overall long-term PQoE by taking the dynamics of users' locations, video requests, and buffer statuses into account. To solve this problem, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to jointly determine segment version selection, and communication and computing resource allocation. Simulation results on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively enhance PQoE compared with benchmark schemes.},

  pages={2733-2738},
  abstract={Digital twin technology can be combined with wire-less virtual reality (VR) to provide workers with an immersive virtual industrial manufacturing environment. In this paper, we consider a scenario of utilizing computing resources at the edge servers to render the virtual representation of physical industrial scenes for workers. In order to provide an immersive experience, the rendered virtual representation in the form of high-quality video needs to be delivered with low latency. The quality of delivered contents is associated with rendering resources and content bitrate, and high-quality contents result in large rendering and transmission delay. The joint resource allocation problem has been formulated, allocating limited bandwidth and edge computing resources, and determining the bitrate of content to achieve low latency and high content quality, in which two objectives are conflicting. To solve this problem, we employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based multi-objective optimization approach which decomposes the original problem into a series of subproblems. Instead of training the DRL model for each subproblem with equal number of episodes, an adaptive subproblem model training scheme has been proposed which terminates the training of subproblem model early based on the model convergence to improve the overall training efficiency. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation strategy in terms of content quality and delay.},

Specifically, we construct two-tier digital twins tailored for vehicular networks to capture networking-related features of vehicles and edge servers. By exploiting such features, we propose a two-stage computing resource allocation scheme. First, the central controller periodically generates reference policies for real-time computing resource allocation according to the network dynamics and service demands captured by digital twins of edge servers. Second, computing resources of the edge servers are allocated in real time to individual vehicles via low-complexity matching-based allocation that complies with the reference policies. By leveraging digital twins, the proposed scheme can adapt to dynamic service demands and vehicle mobility in a scalable manner.

  abstract={In imperfect multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, model-based methods for performance prediction and optimization generally experience degradation in the dynamically changing environment with unknown interference and uncertain channel state information (CSI). To adapt to such challenging settings and better accomplish the network auto-tuning tasks, we propose a generic learnable model-driven framework. We further consider transmit regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding as a usage instance to illustrate the proposed framework. The overall process can be divided into three cascaded stages. First, we design a light neural network for refined prediction of sum rate based on coarse model-driven approximations. Then, the CSI uncertainty is estimated on the learned predictor in an iterative manner. In the last step the regularization term in the transmit RZF precoding is optimized. The effectiveness of the generic framework and the derivative method thereof is showcased via simulation results.},

  abstract={With the widespread use of robotized production lines (RPL) in manufacturing plants, timely and accurate prediction of production line operation performance is very important, which guarantees reasonable adjustment of production planning and resource allocation. The current prediction methods of production line operation performance are mostly off-line prediction, which cannot adjust the prediction model timely according to the dynamic changing characteristics of the manufacturing process, and have the problems of functional lag and low accuracy. In order to address the above issues, a digital twin-driven dynamic prediction method for the operational performance of RPL is proposed. Firstly, the manufacturing process description model and operational performance evaluation indicator are constructed based on multi-source manufacturing data from products, industrial robot equipment, and system operation dimensions. Exploring the time-varying mechanism of the manufacturing system, the digital twin model of RPL is constructed from multi-dimension. Then the correlation between manufacturing data and operational performance is explored using grey relational analysis (GRA). The online extreme learning machine algorithm is proposed to predict the dynamic performance of RPL, which is self-correcting and self-optimizing to realize the dynamic prediction based on the digital twin. Finally, a case study is implemented to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={As wireless systems and protocols evolve to support various services requiring high performance, deploying and operating the wireless mobile networks optimally become more challenging. To address this, artificial intelligence (AI) is getting a tremendous amount of interest for its ability to provide adaptability, scalability, and optimality in an automated and data-driven manner. Operating the network involves decision making processes in highly non-deterministic environments. This calls for the need for RAN Digital Twin, which replicates the states and behaviors of the real networks into virtual simulated networks, so making trial-and-error based optimization possible. However, there still remains challenges in terms of resource-efficiency and real-world applicability. To address efficiency, we propose scenario compaction, which generates a representative condensed scenario using the large volume of real data. We also propose scenario ensemble to train a model robust to the gap between the real and the replicated. As a target application, we tackle a cell on/off based energy-saving operation using reinforcement learning in this paper. Through experiments, we show that our methods provide learning efficiency and they provide an AI module with robust performance when applied to a real base station.},

In recent years, the development of machine learning technologies such as a convolutional neural network has been remarkable, and in the field of video analysis, they achieve very high recognition rates. However, if all sensor data were collected and processed in the cloud, network transmission bandwidth and communication delays would become bottlenecks. The brain is a light weight system that makes decisions based on uncertain observations and We have previously proposed an object recognition method based on a mathematical model of how the brain recognizes information. In this paper, we extend this method. The features of the brain’s recognition of spatial context are modeled by a conditional random field and incorporated into it. We show that our proposal can recognize multiple objects with an accuracy of more than 83.2% even from noisy information, and can be applied to 60 fps video in the evaluation environment.},

  abstract={In real-world scenarios, datasets often perform a long-tailed distribution, making it difficult to train neural net-work models that achieve high accuracy across all classes. In this paper, we explore self-supervised learning for the purpose of learning generalized features and propose a score fusion module to integrate outputs from multiple expert models to obtain a unified prediction. Specifically, we take inspiration from the observation that networks trained on a less unbalanced subset of the distribution tend to produce better performance than networks trained on the entire dataset. However, subsets from tail classes are not adequately represented due to the limitation of data size, which means that their performance is actually unsatisfactory. Therefore, we employ self-supervised learning (SSL) on the whole dataset to obtain a more generalized and transferable feature representation, resulting in a sufficient improvement in subset performance. Unlike previous work that used knowledge distillation models to distill the models trained on a subset to get a unified student model, we propose a score fusion module that directly exploits and integrates the predictions of the subset models. We do extensive experiments on several long-tailed recognition benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our pronosed model.},

  abstract={In many industrial processes it is not possible to measure variables that are crucial to the output quality of the manufactured goods due to manufacturing constraints. One possible approach to overcome this lack of information is using a digital-twin of the manufacturing plant. A digital-twin can make use of data generated by numerical simulation techniques to infer the real time state of the machine. Digital-twins are an established technology and will play a crucial role in optimizing manufacturing plants in the near future. The digital real time state of the manufacturing plant can be used to warn machine operators in case a predefined process window is not reached and the output is expected to violate Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) requirements. This work shows a developed control system and how using a digital twin improves the predictive power of the system. Machine learning models are used to infer the cooling curves of metal sheets in a press hardening process. They are trained on coupled Finite-Element-Method (FEM) Simulation data. We validate the performance of our models on the simulation data and find accurate estimations of the metal blanks temperature with a root mean squared error of 1.6±0.5 K, with this not being possible to measure beforehand.},

  abstract={This paper studies a use case for quickly connecting users with an aerial bass station (BS) in emergency by leveraging digital twin (DT) and robust reinforcement learning (RL). Scattered communities of users are assigned a limited number of channels, and the flying BS is autonomously and optimally placed according to predefined criteria. Q-learning, a common type of RL, is employed as a solution to optimization of BS placement. Two optimization objectives are considered to maximize the per-user data rate in the worst condition and minimize the total BS transmitted power, respectively. To overcome resource limitations of the aerial BS, the RL training with many iterations is done in the DT virtual space connected to the physical space via an aerial BS. In particular, a practically sound max-min technique is proposed to handle the measurement and prediction uncertainties. It is shown that, even if the models used in DT are imperfect and measurements are inaccurate, nearly-optimal results can be obtained in DT. Compared to RL training 100% in the physical space, a huge number of BS moves can be avoided and a significant amount of time and energy can be saved. The assessment results suggest that model and measurement errors, especially when applying DT, should be seriously considered, and the robust optimization technique has potential to handle the uncertainties.},

  abstract={Deep learning-based semantic communications (DLSC) replace the physical blocks in traditional communication systems as end-to-end neural networks. DLSC significantly boost communication efficiency by only transmitting the meaning of data, showing great potentials for applications like automatic driving, digital twin and smart health. However, DLSC are fragile to black-box adversarial attacks due to the openness of wireless channel and sensitivities of neural models. To this end, this paper proposes SemBAT, a novel approach for crafting physical layer black-box adversarial attacks for semantic communication systems. The key ingredients of our method include the training of surrogate encoder and generation of adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we train our surrogate encoder by directly estimating the gradients based on Jacobian-matrixs, and then generate the adversarial perturbations by the particle swarm optimizations. Extensive experiments on a public benchmark show the effectiveness of our proposed SemBAT. We observe that our SemBAT with black-box adversaries can sharply decrease the classification accuracy of the semantic communication system from 78.4% to 11.6%. Meanwhile, such attacks are also imperceptible in terms of image quality metrics measured by the Structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio(PSNR).},

Visualising this technology using mixed reality creates unprecedented opportunities to easily access relevant data and information. In this paper, a digital twins-based system is designed to visualise information from a city’s street lighting system. Data is obtained in two ways: from measured parameters of a miniature model street light in real-time, and from real Durham street lighting. Machine learning is used to maximise the efficiency of purchasing electricity from the grid, and to forecast appropriate adaptive street light brightness levels based on city’s traffic flow and solar irradiance. An application designed in Unity Pro is deployed on a Microsoft HoloLens 2, and it allows the user to view the processed data and control the model street light. It was found that the application performed as desired, displaying information such as voltage, current, carbon emission, electricity price, battery state of charge and LED mode, while enabling control over the model street light. Moreover, the Deep Q-Network machine learning algorithm successfully scheduled to buy electricity at times of low price and low carbon intensity, while the Long Short-Term Memory algorithm accurately forecasted traffic flow with mean Root-Mean-Square Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error values of 12.0% and 20.0% respectively.},

In this paper, we introduce the mean teacher method to CVQE, interfere with the output of teacher and student model by adding noise, and use consistency loss to guide the training of student model.

However, the digital twin creation requires significant authoring to ensure the virtual environment matches the real one by employing 3D technical artistry skills, which demands a professional knowledgeable in this domain. This paper presents a sandbox prototype for scene customization that allows importing, positioning, scaling, and saving changes for mobile robot simulation. Our preliminary testing of the sandbox has focused on usability to understand how the setting up of the environment is perceived. Preliminary results indicate that the sandbox is usable with improvements pertaining to improving the manipulation of the objects.},
