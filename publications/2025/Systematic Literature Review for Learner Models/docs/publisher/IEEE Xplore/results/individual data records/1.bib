  abstract={In order to achieve collaborative learning in network learning system, two primary questions must be solved. First is how to choose and quantify the proper features to build user model. Second is how to divide the users into optimal teams to play the best effectiveness of collaborative learning. Based on the collaborative learning theory, its practical research, and the conditions of network learning system, the paper selects learning interest and knowledge level as user's features, using the methods of educational psychology measurement to quantify these two features so as to establish user model. Considering the elements and some practical teaching cases of collaborative learning, the paper derives the requirements of collaborative learning's basic unit: the collaboration group, and defines three features of collaborative group as: the cohesion within group, the hierarchy within group and the uniformity among groups. Then, the paper builds the group model and put forward the objective function of collaborative learning grouping scheme. Finally, from the perspective of clustering and combinatorial optimization, the paper investigates how to divide the users into collaborative learning's groups. As a result, it comes up the method as follows. Above all, according to the users' learning interest, it uses K-means to cluster the users into different clusters. Then in each cluster, genetic algorithm is adopted for collaborative learning's group division according to the users' knowledge level. Thus, the paper achieves the automatic group division to find the approximate optimal collaboration learning groups. Lastly, through the simulation experiments, the validity of the method is proved.},

  abstract={In this paper a set of student's characteristics that have to be considered in an adaptive and/or personalized programming tutoring system is presented. This set is called K.E.M.Cs and includes: knowledge, errors, motivation and cognitive states. It allows the system to identify the variety of backgrounds of prospective learners of programming, their misconceptions, needs and learning pace. The modeling of K.E.M.C.s is performed through a combination of different student modeling techniques: overlay, stereotypes, fuzzy logic and OCC cognitive theory. The gain of this approach is that the particular student model represents a sufficiently large part of the complex dimensions of a real student of programming. Therefore, it can be the base for the improvement of the quality of the learning process.},

  abstract={Effective teaching-learning process consists of identifying gaps in the student knowledge and filling the gaps by personalized teaching, which is difficult in classroom teaching. An Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) provides personalized instructions to the students based on the student knowledge level and learning preferences. In ITS, the student model plays an important role, as it represents the student knowledge state, which is used to generate lessons, problems, feedback and guidance in a personalized manner. This paper describes student model for an Intelligent Language Tutoring System to learn verb/noun inflection grammar rules of Telugu language. The student model is used to represent the confidence level of a student in applying each grammar rule, which is used by tutor to generate problems to improve in weak areas. A pilot study is done to measure the effectiveness of the system.},

  abstract={Recently, many works have investigated the identification of learner's working memory capacity (WMC) from his/her behavior in learning systems. These works used a mechanism, called dichotomic node network, able to create representation of the learner's WMC taking into account different theories from the literature. However, this mechanism could only provide a binary representation of learner's WMC (High or Low), whereas the WMC is estimated by 7 (plus or minus two) items. This paper presents an alternative based on fuzzy logic for precisely estimate the WMC of the learner while using learning system or playing educational games. The proposed approach can improve the accuracy of learner model and then enable the fine grained recommendations that positively affect the learners' learning.},

Although most of the ITS were used to teach programming, other topics such as database design and computer literacy were also represented. There was a significant overall effect size favoring the use of ITS. There was a significant advantage of ITS over teacher-led classroom instruction and non-ITS computer-based instruction.

  abstract={Learning Management Systems (LMSs) are widely deployed nowadays in higher education institutions. They are mainly designed for formal and instructivist transmission models of learning. We propose a design for a hybrid institutional learning platform that suitably supports the simultaneous coexistence of formal/informal and instructivist/self-regulated learning. The design relies on a social collaborative learning pattern, open group-sourcing, based on peer production and feedback. To match peers' interactions with learners' skills, we align the visitor/resident learner model with the weighted peer production model. In this paper, we describe the different concepts that motivate our model and how it is concretely realized as a learning platform. We finally illustrate the whole with some of experiments and tests.},

  abstract={Traditional e-learning systems have been, typically, designed for a generic learner, irrespective of individual knowledge, skills and learning styles. In contrast, adaptive e-learning systems can enhance learning by taking into account different learner characteristics and by personalising learning material. Although a large number of systems incorporating learning style have been deployed, there is a lack of comprehensive, comparative evaluations. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by comparing a number of adaptive e-learning systems. It considers three main perspectives: the learner model, the domain model and the adaptation model. A set of criteria is generated for each perspective, and applied to a representative sample of adaptive e-learning systems.},

  abstract={The learning systems are designed for learning about a particular area. Then, it is usually necessary to know the state of knowledge of the learner on a domain before customizing or adapting the learning process. In this paper, we are interested in the semantic analysis of the learner's query put on the WEB by using the domain ontology. The purpose of this analysis is to identify the concepts of domain that are most asked on the Web and to keep them into the learner's model as concepts not well mastered. We hypothesize that all concepts sought on the web via the search engine can be considered as knowledge poorly or badly acquired by learners and deserve thus more attention and consideration both by the tutor for the pedagogical monitoring of learners on these concepts and from the designer of course, to restructure and more enrich the educational content which articulates these concepts identified beforehand in this analysis.},

  abstract={Online mentoring is nowadays become popular because it can be used in various applications. Particularly in education area, the mentoring generally means the interactions between the teachers as the mentors and the students as the mentees. In order to work together successfully, this paper believes that not only some common attributes between the mentor and the mentee are required but also some compatible different attributes. This paper thus proposes the attributes for online monitoring model named compatible different attributes. There are 2 sets of compatible different attributes including mentee and mentor attributes. Both sets are represented in different size of matrix elements. The objective of this paper is thus to study to which extent the proposed compatible different attributes can be used for online mentoring model. The empirical study is conducted with 74 lectures and 588 students from Faculty of Information and Technology, Rajabhat Maha Sarakham University. They are asked to complete the survey questionnaire to obtain the satisfaction value. Consequently, the satisfaction results show that the proposed attributes can reasonably be used for online monitoring model.},

  abstract={We have developed a web-based, interactive, watershed planning system called WRESTORE (Watershed Restoration Using Spatio-Temporal Optimization of Resources) (http://wrestore.iupui.edu) that allows stake-holder communities to participate in a democratic, collaborative form of optimization process for designing best management practices (BMPs) on their landscape, while also optimizing based on subjective, qualitative landowners' criteria beyond the usual socio-economic, physical, and ecological criteria. This system utilizes multiple advanced computational approaches including the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrologic model for watershed simulations, interactive genetic algorithms and reinforcement-based machine learning algorithms for search and optimization, and deep learning artificial neural networks for user modeling, within an encompassing human-computer interaction framework. A substantial user study of the WRESTORE system was conducted recently involving multiple real stakeholders varying from consultants, government officials, watershed alliance members, etc., with the objective of gaining insight about WRESTORE'S usability and utility. In particular focus was the user modeling component that develops a computational model of a user's preferences and criteria, based on real-time user-provided ratings for a subset of possible designs (similar to the idea of user profiling commonly done for human-computer interaction systems). The user model constructed based on the real user's personalized feedbacks can then be used to influence the automated search and optimization for BMP alternatives in WRESTORE. In this paper, we describe the methods developed for user modeling for interactive optimization, and the experimental set-up as well as results with real user studies. These results clearly demonstrate that development of user models for such personalized, interactive optimization is both feasible and valuable for developing community-based computational water sustainability solutions.},

  abstract={An Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) provides direct customized instruction or feedback to students while they perform a task in a tutoring system without the intervention of a human. One of the main functions of an ITS system is to present its students with course materials that are most appropriate to their current knowledge of domain concepts, example being one of the course materials. ITS systems typically compare and analyze student model (SM) components for student's current knowledge of concepts (main topics, e.g. Scanf in C programming) that are required to understand the next example (e.g. Codes for scanf) suitable for learning a task (e.g. Write C code to read 2 integers from the keyboard). Existing systems such as NavEx and PADS perform an exhaustive matching of student knowledge level with all examples in the database. This research proposes a task-based technique for managing and classifying examples for more effective retrieval of relevant examples for learning a task. We propose a system called EASK for translating task and example solutions into concepts for similarity matching, which is more readily available, easily extendible and adaptable to other domains. Examples and tasks are represented as vectors of weights computed with term frequency measure TFIDF that signify the importance of a concept for an example. Examples most similar to a task are found by using a classification method called k-NN, which finds the closeness between different objects such as examples and tasks using cosine similarity measure and selecting the k objects (examples) with highest similarity scores. As a by-product, k-NN also predicts the class label (difficulty level) of the task. Our proposed model achieves this prediction with 89% accuracy.},

  abstract={Adaptive learning systems require student model repository that store student's data in order to provide learning materials tailored to the student's characteristics. Student's learning style is one of the most crucial factors to be identified in order to update the student's profile. Hence, the need for a high accurate classifier that deals with the students data and generates suitable number of rules that can automatically identify student's learning style in adaptive learning environments is an important issue. In this paper, Bijective soft set algorithm is used in classifying students learning style based on Felder Silverman learning style model. The discernible matrix parameter reduction was used to generate attributes reducts, whereby rules were generated from these reducts. Experiments were carried out using simulated data with various attributes that represent student's characteristics according to the four dimensions of Felder Silverman model. The experiments revealed that Bijective soft set gives high classification accuracy with suitable number of rules. The algorithm was further verified with Rough Set and FURIA as a comparative analysis of the performance of the proposed model.},

  abstract={The design of the digital resource is an expensive process that consumes time and money. By optimizing an adaptive process would reduce time for the designers and users. The increase in the production of digital data in these last few years has raised several issues regarding the management of heterogeneous and multiple source data in the user's environment. In this paper, we focus on adaptive digital resource modelling to assist users in the consolidated management of digital resources in an interactive and adaptive system. In this paper we propose an approach of digital resources modelling which will make the use of digital resources more adaptive. We introduce an adaptive resource model which includes LOM (Learning Object Metadata) metadata, manipulation rules and operators. This model allows an automatic adaptation to user's profiles and user's contexts. An experimental implementation called PRISE (Personal Interactive research Smart Environment) is carried out in our laboratory. PRISE is an interactive and adaptive system to assist researchers in using and managing their digital resources efficiently. PRISE architecture is based on three essential parts of the system : the user model, the process model and the resource model. Our aim is to maintain a consistency in terms of interaction between the users and the digital resources.},

  abstract={We propose a model for deployment of software tutors. In the model, the first stage of the pre-test-practice post-test evaluation protocol is used to initialize the student model needed for adaptation. In order to keep assessment congruent with learning, the same type of activity is used in all three stages of evaluation, and the software tutor itself is used to administer all three stages of the protocol. In order to minimize time while maximizing learning, post-test is set to adapt to practice, and students are also provided feedback after pre-test activities on which they provide incorrect response. Finally, the software tutor is set up to administer the pre-test-practice-post-test protocol as one seamless integrated session with no discernible breaks between the stages. This model of deployment helps the developer evaluate the effectiveness of the software tutor, helps the student minimize time while maximizing learning and enables the instructor to obtain concept-level summary of what worked and what needs to be reviewed again in the classroom. The deployment model has been implemented in software tutors for programming, called problets (problets.org). We produce quantitative data from three problets used in spring 2013 to illustrate the benefits of the deployment model that accrue to developers, students and instructors.},

User modeling system is the heart of adaptive learning. This research proposes a novel user modeling system named Zebra which manipulates students' characteristics in the effective way. Moreover, Zebra provides powerful inference mechanism for reasoning out new information about students in order to support adaptive learning in the best way. Zebra is implemented as computer software and so, the purpose of this paper is to introduce Zebra - a novel and powerful user modeling system.},

  abstract={Digital libraries on distance learning platforms are ways that allow learners to consult and enrich their knowledge on the content that are studied in their course. In this paper, we are interested in the semantic analysis of the content of the resources visited in the digital libraries (eBooks) by learners using domain ontology. The purpose of this analysis is to identify the domain concepts that are most consulted and read by learners from the digital libraries and to keep them into the leaner's model as concepts not well mastered. We hypothesize that all domain concepts visited in resources from the digital libraries can be considered as knowledge poorly or badly acquired by learners and merit thus more attention and consideration both by the tutor for the didactic monitoring of learners on these concepts and from author of course, to restructure and more enrich the educational content which articulate these concepts identified beforehand in this analysis.},

  abstract={The web is increasingly moving towards structuring and to taking into consideration of semantics, particularly with XML and ontology. In addition, access to information requires the use of web tools for information retrieval (IR). Many methods from traditional IR were extended to structured documents. On the other hand, approaches have been proposed to regard specifically semantics in structured documents by using external semantic resources while collecting original documents on which it is necessary to provide semantic similarity measures in order to perform comparisons between concepts. Most previous approaches did not take into account the relations between concepts and are not tailored to the specific needs of learners. In this paper a semantic IR system of structured educational documents is proposed and adapted to the needs and preferences of the learner. This approach is based on a representation of the nodes of the document's tree and of the query through the semantic vectors of those concepts. Tests show the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={We aim to provide grammar error feedback to learners. It is known that grammar error detection and feedback are challenging problems in written language, however, they become much more difficult tasks in oral conversation because it is difficult for a system to judge whether an error is due to grammar or automatic speech recognition (ASR). False alarms occur when a learner correctly utters a remark, but the system gives feedback implying an error. Minimizing the false alarm rate is especially critical in education applications because it is imperative that the tutor give correct instruction to learners. Thus, to reduce the false alarm rate in grammar error detection and feedback, we apply a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) when the system provides feedback about a learner's mistake. The POMDP models uncertainty between grammar errors and ASR errors. An additional advantage of our method is that “belief states” in POMDP can be used for learner models which indicate each individual learner's grammar comprehension level.},

User-friendly interface design visualization tools directly influence the sustainability of learners' motivation to continuously engage with the instruction. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for enhancing the motivation of learners in an open learner model environment. Such a framework incorporates six motivational open learner model tools, which are in alignment with the attention (A), relevance (R), confidence (C), and satisfaction (S) model's motivational components respectively. The integration of these tools not only will enhance learners' motivation in engaging with open learner models, but also assist learners to sustain their motivation in dealing with this instruction. The findings of this study will assist designers to develop a more effective open learner model to enhance and sustain learners' learning motivation in technology-assisted learning environments.},

  abstract={Peer-assessment can be used to evaluate the knowledge level achieved by learners, while exposing them to a significant leaning activity at the same time. Here we see an approach to semi-automatic grading of school works. It is based on peer-assessment of answers to open ended questions (“open answers”), supported by the teacher grading activity performed on a portion of the answers. The methodology we present is based on a representation of student model and answers through Bayesian networks. It supports grading in a six-values scale (the widely used “A” to “F” scale). The experiments we present test the possibility to model the fact that knowledge required to perform some work is preparatory to that required for a subsequent one. The experiments have been conducted using the web-based system OpenAnswer and were meant to collect datasets, to be exploited in order to evaluate the various algorithms, settings and termination conditions better to be applied in order to have a reliable set of grading out of the learners' peer-assessment process and the teacher's grading work (with the latter limited to a significantly limited percentage of the answers to be graded).},

The goal of any ITS system is to help the students to achieve maximum learning gain and improve their engagements to the systems by capturing the student's interests through the system's adaptive behavior. In other words an ITS system is always developed with the aim of providing an immediate and efficient solution to student's learning problems. In recent years a lot of work has been devoted to improving student and tutor models in order enhance the teaching and learning activities within the ITS systems.

The use of fuzzy logic in this context is to enable the computational analysis of the student's characteristics and learning behaviours in order to handle the uncertainty issues related to the student model design.

  abstract={In this paper, a novel approach to web-based education that performs individualized instruction on the domain of programming languages is presented. This approach is fully implemented and evaluated in an educational application module, called fuzzy knowledge state definer (FuzKSD). In particular, FuzKSD performs user modeling by dynamically identifying and updating a student's knowledge level of all the concepts of the domain knowledge. The operation of FuzKSD is based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) that are used to represent the dependences among the domain concepts. FuzKSD uses fuzzy sets to represent a student's knowledge level as a subset of the domain knowledge. Thus, it combines fuzzy theory with the overlay model. Moreover, it employs a novel inference mechanism that dynamically updates user stereotypes using fuzzy sets. It should be noted that the overlay model and stereotypes constitute two widely used methods for user modeling. However, they have not been combined with fuzzy sets thus far in the literature. The gain from this novel combination is significant as a student level of knowledge is represented in a more realistic way by automatically modeling the learning or forgetting process of a student with respect to the FCMs and thus the system can provide individualized adaptive advice. The application of this approach is not limited to adaptive instruction. It can also be used in other systems with changeable user states, such as e-shops, where consumers' preferences change over time and affect one another. Therefore, the particular module constitutes a novel generic fuzzy tool, which offers dynamic adaptation to users' needs and preferences of adaptive systems.},

  abstract={We present the design, implementation, and preliminary evaluation of our Adaptive Educational System (AES): the Mobile Integrated and Individualized Course (MIIC). MIIC is a platform for personalized course delivery which integrates lecture videos, text, assessments, and social learning into a mobile native app, and collects clickstream-level behavioral measurements about each student as they interact with the material. These measurements can subsequently be used to update the student's user model, which can in turn be used to determine the content adaptation. Recruiting students from one of our Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), we have conducted two preliminary trials with MIIC, in which we found (i) that the majority of students (70 percent) preferred MIIC overall to a one-size-fits-all (OSFA) presentation of the same material, (ii) that the mean level of engagement, when quantified as the number of pages viewed, was statistically higher (by 72 percent) among students using MIIC than among OSFA, and (iii) that the integrated multimedia learning features were generally favorable among the students (e.g., 87 percent found the videos helpful).},

  abstract={We introduce FCUBE, a cloud-based framework that enables machine learning researchers to contribute their learners to its community-shared repository. FCUBE exploits data parallelism in lieu of algorithmic parallelization to allow its users to efficiently tackle large data problems automatically. It passes random subsets of data generated via resampling to multiple learners that it executes simultaneously and then it combines their model predictions with a simple fusion technique. It is an example of what we have named a Bring Your Own Learner model. It allows multiple machine learning researchers to contribute algorithms in a plug-and-play style. We contend that the Bring Your Own Learner model signals a design shift in cloud-based machine learning infrastructure because it is capable of executing anyone's supervised machine learning algorithm. We demonstrate FCUBE executing five different learners contributed by three different machine learning groups on a 100 node deployment on Amazon EC2. They collectively solve a publicly available classification problem trained with 11 million exemplars from the Higgs dataset.},

Therefore, the user interface should be adapted to the needs of each geographical location to provide optimal user experience.

The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, a generic adaptive framework aimed at enhancing learning is proposed. Second, a specific approach to adaptivity based on learning style is put forward within the framework. Third, the framework is validated and the approach is evaluated in order to determine their effectiveness in learning provision in an adaptive e-learning system. An experiment conducted with 60 participants produced positive results. They indicate that adapting instructional material according to learning style yields significantly better learning outcome and learner satisfaction than without adaptation.},

  abstract={Personalization and adaptation are at the core of Intelligent Tutoring Systems. The Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) Student Model is a time-tested method that maintains information about students' knowledge levels for the different skills in the topic domain. In our previous work, we had proposed the Personalized, Clustered, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (PC-BKT) model that individualizes the learning of skills for each student and additionally improves the prediction for the cold start problem. A clustering of both students and skills based on a student and skill capability matrix was used to learn the prior skills to deal with the cold start problem, which is the prediction for either new skills or new students. Both the BKT and the PC-BKT models assume that a skill once learnt is never forgotten. But forgetting is pervasive. If a previously learnt skill is not used for a while, there is a higher chance of forgetting it. One of the factors that influence the forgetting is the time duration before the current attempt at using a skill and the previous attempt. We incorporate forgetting as a time decay function in the BKT and PC-BKT models and show significant increase in the accuracy of the student prediction.},

Although industry has started specifying trades through competencies, similar attempts are not initiated for education yet. In this paper, we present a unifying model for training programs, professions and learners, built around competencies. Based on this model, several tools have been developed to help (1) educational teams to make sure that conceptions of curriculum fit the targeted learning objectives, (2) learners to make their careers choices through life easier, (3) industrial actors to identify training programs matching with their needs.},

To develop such system, two learner models (rule based model and clustering model) were built using 80 presentations graded by three human experts. An experiment to determine the best learner model and students' perception was carried out using 51 presentations uploaded by students. The findings show that the clustering model classified in a similar way as a human evaluator only when a holistic evaluation criterion was used. Whereas, the rule-base model was more precise when the evaluation rules were easier to be followed by a human evaluator. Furthermore, students agreed with the usefulness of the system as well as the level of agreement with the grading model, although the latter in a lesser extent. Results from this study encourage to explore this area and adapt the proposed Intelligent Tutor System to other existing automated grading systems.},

  abstract={Various motivational designs have been introduced to improve learners' motivations in engaging with technology-mediated learning. This study presents an investigation of the impact of learning preferences on their motivations towards the attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) motivational design in an open learner model (OLM) environment. Data was collected from undergraduate students in a university in Malaysia by using an online survey. A chi-square test was performed to explore the relationship between learning preferences and motivations in a higher education setting. The result reveals that an ARCS motivational design can impact learners' motivations towards the adoption of open learner models. The implications of this study will assist educational institutions to develop more effective and efficient policies for improving the adoption of open learner models in technology-mediated teaching and learning.},

  abstract={Naturally every individual is unique. Thus, learning process in every learner is also different. On the other hand, education requires every learner to achieve a certain standard of competency. Standards are made to ensure all learners meet the defined learning outcome. In order to help learner achieve the targeted competency based on their own pace and way of learning, we propose personalized e-learning architecture that complies with standard. This study explores various theories and best practices of e-learning and confronted with various ways of learning due to cultural diversity in Indonesia. The analysis reveals components that commonly play important part in personalization: integrated learning structure, learner model, personalized learning scenario, personalized content selection, and portfolio-based assessment. These five components are interrelated to compose personalized e-learning system. The proposed architecture facilitates various ways of learning as well as aligns with expected learning outcome. A prototype system of the proposed architecture will be built in future to show the contribution.},

  abstract={Biometric systems have been applied to improve the security of several computational systems. These systems analyse physiological or behavioural features obtained from the users in order to perform authentication. Biometric features should ideally meet a number of requirements, including permanence. In biometrics, permanence means that the analysed biometric feature will not change over time. However, recent studies have shown that this is not the case for several biometric modalities. Adaptive biometric systems deal with this issue by adapting the user model over time. Some algorithms for adaptive biometrics have been investigated and compared in the literature. In machine learning, several studies show that the combination of individual techniques in ensembles may lead to more accurate and stable decision models. This paper investigates the usage of some ensemble approaches to combine the output of current adaptive algorithms for biometrics. The experiments are carried out on keystroke dynamics, a biometric modality known to be subject to change over time.},

  abstract={Computing Environment for Human Learning (CEHL) systems are based on the use of new technologies to improve the quality of learning. However, their training suffers from a crucial problem mainly in the construction of the adapted learning process according to the needs of the learner. In fact thousands of educational resources are available through the web today. Therefore, the learner gets lost and hesitated to choose the most adequate educational resources according to their preferences and state of knowledge. This paper aims to define reusable, accessible and adapted educational resources. For reusing phase, we propose to define a composed educational resource by assembling existing resources through an appropriate schema called also a narrative structure. For the adaptation, we propose a new general learner model. We treat not only the pedagogic aspect, but also the psychological aspect of the learner by including models from cognitive theories such as the MBTI model (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator).},

We describe our approach which has the particularity to put some order within personal learning environment. Moreover, we propose in our approach to assist the learner in the more complex phases of his learning. In fact, an effective learning experience must be based on a clear learning objective and a detailed curriculum describing the specific learning objectives. In traditional learning systems, online or offline, those tasks are made by experts. However in personal learning environment, the learner himself must build the personal learning environment. Thanks to our approach throw the use of ontologies, Bloom taxonomy, and learner profile, is able to assist the learner to accomplish the mentioned tasks without a direct need for experts.},

  abstract={Working memory is the system used by every human for temporarily storing and managing the information required to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning, reasoning and comprehension. In particular, working memory capacity plays an important role in learning process, because learner often have to hold information in mind while engaged in a learning activities. Having information about learners' WMC could be helpful to support them during the learning process. Khenissi et al. [1] proposed an approach based on fuzzy logic for learner's modeling while using educational games and/or e-learning system. This paper will detail the description of the mechanism proposed by Khenissi et al. [1]. Furthermore, it will describe how the system architecture will be improved by the automatic generation of the fuzzy logic components. In particular, the machine learning, web services and the model of educational games are adopted for automatically generate the components of the fuzzy logic system. The automatic generation of these components will help the expert in parameterizing them, and thus better estimation of the learner's WMC.},

  abstract={One of the most important element for adapting and personalizing Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) is the learner model because it contains a lot of useful information about an individual such as learning preferences, academic performance and learning styles. These latter, which are increasingly being incorporated into TEL, and seems to be a promising concept for making learning easier for students. The application of these concepts in traditional learning is almost impossible as we only have one teacher with thirty or even hundreds of students in a class, so he can not apply an adaptive learning for each of them. However, the emergence of adaptive learning management system (LMS) offers a great advantage for students, as it allows them to have a personalized learning process that can be suited with their needs and characteristics. Now days, many researchers has been working in this area. The purpose of this article is to propose a learner model ontology SLMonto based on popular student modeling standards. As well as the representation of the prior knowledge of the student's performance, motivation, and the learning style which is adapted from Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model.},

  abstract={Social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook have become an important forum for peer interaction. Micro-blogging offered by such outlets allows people to publish, share and discuss short messages on the web. In academic institutions, micro-blogging offers a backchannel forum during live classes. It is popular among group of friends and professional colleagues who can also update content and follow each other's post, creating a sense of online learning forum. Latent use of social media and micro-blogging services in education, students and academicians embracing these technologies by sharing everything from personal to general interests and current events. Our Research motive is to embed social networking software into Learning Management System. As an initial step, we aim to analyze and compare micro-blogging behavior of different users in the academic institutions. Students experience, perceptions, attitudes and interactions may differ because online social sites are relatively new in the academic research. The result shows their posting behaviors, activities and perceived benefits. Result and findings helped us to build a user model and got an initial understanding of how students and faculties are likely to use micro-blogging in and out of academic institution.},

  pages={496-503},
  abstract={The exponential and rapid growth of the E-commerce based both on the new opportunities offered by the Internet, and on the spread of the use of debit or credit cards in the online purchases, has strongly increased the number of frauds, causing large economic losses to the involved businesses. The design of effective strategies able to face this problem is however particularly challenging, due to several factors, such as the heterogeneity and the non-stationary distribution of the data stream, as well as the presence of an imbalanced class distribution. To complicate the problem, there is the scarcity of public datasets for confidentiality issues, which does not allow researchers to verify the new strategies in many data contexts. Differently from the canonical state-of-the-art strategies, instead of defining a unique model based on the past transactions of the users, we follow a Divide and Conquer strategy, by defining multiple models (user behavioral patterns), which we exploit to evaluate a new transaction, in order to detect potential attempts of fraud. We can act on some parameters of this process, in order to adapt the models sensitivity to the operating environment. Considering that our models do not need to be trained with both the past legitimate and fraudulent transactions of a user, since they use only the legitimate ones, we can operate in a proactive manner, by detecting fraudulent transactions that have never occurred in the past. Such a way to proceed also overcomes the data imbalance problem that afflicts the machine learning approaches. The evaluation of the proposed approach is performed by comparing it with one of the most performant approaches at the state of the art as Random Forests, using a real-world credit card dataset.},

A specific implementation of this approach is presented by which learners' self-direction and self-determination in a social e-learning context could be potentially promoted. Unlike previous work, the proposed approach, multifaceted OSLM, lets the system seamlessly and adaptively embed visualization of both a learner's own model and other learning peers' models into different parts of the learning content, for multiple axes of context, at any time during the learning process. It also demonstrates the advantages of visualizing both learners' performance and their contribution to a learning community. An experimental study shows that, contrary to previous research, the richness and complexity of this new approach positively affected the learning experience in terms of perceived effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

  abstract={Learning Management System (LMS) has been used widely in many institutions to implement e-learning. This is due to the flexibility of LMS to deliver the learning materials in various ways and approaches. However, the heterogeneous of students' behavior, the diversity of learning materials and the complexity of hyperlink for navigation are the main factors of limitation in LMS and can caused cognitive overload among students. Many literatures show that, providing an e-learning system that considers student preferences and needs can improve student performances and understanding. Therefore, this research proposed a new framework to enhance LMS to support adaptive features. The proposed enhancement of LMS is implemented in Moodle platform which includes major adaptation features based on visual and verbal dimension of Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM) and the student's knowledge level. The enhanced framework is organized into three models; domain model, student model and adaptive model that need to interact together to perform adaptively in presenting the learning materials. Three multi-agent components have been added to the Moodle platform to implement the adaptation. The current Moodle repository has also been modified by creating additional fields that are necessary for adaptation.},

  abstract={The Internet has become an integral part of our everyday life. Unfortunately, not all of us are equally aware of the threats when we use online services. Naive users are generally less aware of security and privacy practices on the Internet and are susceptible to online predators. In this paper, we present a behavioral analysis of Internet users and their susceptibility to online malpractices. We have considered the dataset from the Global Internet User Survey for 10789 respondents to perform a security-oriented statistical analysis of correlated user behavior. We constructed logistic regression models to analyze the statistical predictability of susceptible and not-so-susceptible identity theft victims based on their behavior and knowledge of security and privacy practices. We posit that such a study can be used to assess the vulnerability of Internet users and can hence be used to leverage institutional and personal safety on the Internet by promoting online security education, threat awareness, and guided Internet-safe behavior.},

  abstract={An adaptive learning system is an alternative learning method for the traditional “one-size-fits-all” approach in learning. With adaptive learning systems a user will get a learning scenario and materials that fit their needs and characteristics. Adaptation is produced by the main components of adaptive learning systems, including the domain, goal, user, adaptation and presentation models. In this paper, we discuss our analysis and design of knowledge tracing, a method for inferencing the user and domain models, which supports knowledge tracing. We implemented a cognitively-oriented domain model represented in a graph and studied the influence of slip, guess, and learning rate parameters, in addition to user's performance, to pCorrect, which is a probability that the user can solve a problem. Our analysis of the algorithm and the experiment results show that slip parameter is inversely proportional to the pCorrect, while guess is directly proportional to pCorrect.},

  abstract={The high development of emerging computing paradigms, such as Ubiquitous Computing, Mobile Computing, and Social Computing, has brought us a big change from all walks of our work, life, learning and entertainment. Especially, with the high accessibility of social networking services along with the increasingly pervasive use of portable wireless mobile computing devices, more and more populations have been engaged into this kind of integration of real physical world and cyber digital space, which can be called the hyper world. To help people live better in the highly developed information society, the so-called cyber-individual (Cyber-I), which is far beyond a user model or a software agent to assist a user, has been proposed to provide the most comprehensive digital entities for its corresponding Real-I in terms of the individual's experience, behavior, and thinking as well as his or her birth, growth, and death. In this study, we concentrate on the personal data analytics to facilitate the cyber individual modeling. Organic Stream is introduced to systematically organize and refine the personal stream data, which can help improve the data processing and management in the CI-Spine tier and CI-Pivot tier of Cyber-I. The DSUN (Dynamically Socialized User Networking) model is employed to better utilize the collective intelligence from a group of users, which can help improve the CI-Mind tier to make Cyber-I to become more robust. Based on these, we discuss the functional modules for the facilitation of cyber individual modeling. Finally, a scenario is given, and the experimental results are presented to demonstrate that the valuable outcomes from the personal analysis can be utilized to enrich the Cyber-I, and provide users with more suitable services.},

  abstract={This paper builds upon theoretical studies in the field of social constructivism. Lev Vygotsky is considered one of the greatest representatives of this research line, with his theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). Our work aims at integrating this concept in the practice of a computer-assisted learning system. For each learner, the system stores a model summarizing the current Student Knowledge (SK). Each educational activity is specified through the deployed content, the skills required to tackle it, and those acquired, and is further annotated by the effort estimated for the task. The latter may change from one student to another, given the already achieved competence. A suitable weighting of the robustness (certainty) of student's skills, stored in SK, and their combination are used to verify the inclusion of a learning activity in the student's ZPD. With respect to our previous work, the algorithm for the calculation of the ZPD of the individual student has been optimized, by enhancing the certainty weighting policy, and a graphical display of the ZPD has been added. Thanks to the latter, the student can get a clear vision of the learning paths that he/she can presently tackle. This both facilitates the educational process, and helps developing the metacognitive ability self-assessment.},

Multiple approaches are used to model these environments, but only a few of them deal with adult education, which is becoming more and more important, as adult learners are increasingly interested in online education. In fact, learner models-, which are the foundation of adaptive learning systems-that exist nowadays, are limited to modeling only a few learner's characteristics such as learner's knowledge and competencies, but they neglect other parameters that are as important for the adult learner. This paper aims to identify adult learners' different characteristics, and to define a taxonomy that can aid the design of a model that incorporate the adult learner in an adaptive learning environment.},

  abstract={This paper presents a dynamic Bayesian network model for the assessment of students' algebraic knowledge in step-based intelligent tutoring systems. The proposed work assesses knowledge about concept, skills, and misconceptions of learners. Furthermore, the proposed model is independent of the problems provided by the system (i.e., equations), because it considers the algebraic operation used by the student to solve a step as evidence instead of the final solution provided by the student. Results of evaluations comparing student's performance on a posttest with the inference of the proposed model showed statistically significant similarities between them, indicating that the inference performed by the model was accurate.},

  abstract={Many students in higher education are required to complete graduate work while learning state-of-the-art technologies and theories in their laboratories. To obtain their objectives efficiently, although it is important that students accumulate, share, and apply "research know-how", these are generally tough tasks because most students graduate without conveying their know-how to juniors. Inspired by the concepts of Knowledge Management (KM) and Human-Agent Interaction (HAI), we previously proposed a system to support the research activity of students. It presents appropriate know-how based on two types of model: the first expresses relationships between tagged information, the second represents features and trends of information retrieved and evaluated by the students. In this paper, we conducted several experiments using the prototype of our developed system: (i) to evaluate the validity of the user model constructed for respective users (students) based on their usage history of the prototype system, and (ii) to discuss whether the user model adequately estimates users' trends in terms of know-how retrieval/evaluation.},

  abstract={The aim of this paper is to present the adaptive learning system called ALS_CORR[LP]1. This system belongs to a very specific class of the e-learning systems, which is the adaptive learning ones. In fact they have the ability to adapt the learning process according to each learner needs, learning styles, objectives, etc. ALS_CORR[LP] is based on the learner prerequisites and the learning styles of Felder-Silverman, to design the learner model. As for the domain model, it is designed according to the recommendations of the differentiated pedagogy, which advocates creating multiple versions of the same learning object. Finally in order to ensure the adaptation inside the system, a Bayesian network, to match the designed learning object with the specifics of the learner profile was developed. It is also necessary to emphasize, that the major feature of the system is, its ability to correct the generated learning path in case of a failure in the evaluation phase. The learning path relevance is questioned, based on a recommendation system which enables updating the initial profile, or recommending the most relevant versions of the learning object, in case where the similarity calculation in behavior, reveals that the observed behavior in the system does not fit the initial profile description.},

Apparently, studies on user preference across gender for adaptive tutoring systems remain scarce among university users in Malaysia. With the aim of describing the differences between genders in user preferences for the method of gaining information, online games, online movies, online music, pictures, as well as colors of the adaptive tutoring system, this paper used quantitative methods through data gathering for finding the results of this study. Sixty-eight respondents were chosen from among academicians, administrative staff and students of a public university in Malaysia. Descriptive analysis of the data shows that there exists a pattern of different preferences for adaptive tutoring systems across gender.

In this case study, a Next-App prediction service is built to demonstrate the use of the framework and to evaluate the usefulness of such a prediction service. Next-App analyses a user's data, learns patterns, makes a model for a user, and finally predicts based on the user model and current context, what application(s) the user is likely to want to use. The prediction is pro-active and dynamic; it is dynamic both in responding to the current context, and also in that it responds to changes in the user model, as might occur over time as a user's habits change.

  abstract={Real-time adaptation of computer games' content to the users' skills and abilities can enhance the player's engagement and immersion. Understanding of the user's potential while playing is of high importance in order to allow the successful procedural generation of user-tailored content. We investigate how player models can be created in car racing games. Our user model uses a combination of data from unobtrusive sensors, while the user is playing a car racing simulator. It extracts features through machine learning techniques, which are then used to comprehend the user's gameplay, by utilising the educational theoretical frameworks of the Concept of Flow and Zone of Proximal Development. The end result is to provide at a next stage a new track that fits to the user needs, which aids both the training of the driver and their engagement in the game. In order to validate that the system is designing personalised tracks, we associated the average performance from 41 users that played the game, with the difficulty factor of the generated track. In addition, the variation in paths of the implemented tracks between users provides a good indicator for the suitability of the system.},

We apply a feature extraction approach based on the frequent pattern mining of gesture sequence to the user modeling. The learned user model detects types of problems in real time and is used for automated help. To optimize of instruction timing and its selection, we use a Bayesian reinforcement learning approach, which balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off. We evaluate the effectiveness of the method by using a prototype assistant system for a map application. The evaluation with older (60+) novice users showed positive results.

AEHS constitutes three basic modules, the content module, the adaptation module and the user module. The user module is the heart of the system, based on which the adaptation module personalize the content. A User models in AEHS is either static, i.e the information about the user characteristics is collected and updated before starting the adaptation or in habitual intervals, or dynamic where the user information is updated continuously as the user interact with the system.

  year={2016},
  volume={28},
  number={3},
  pages={372-386},
  abstract={Designers of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) have long been interested in delivering personalized teaching to individual students, typically by ensuring that the student receives content appropriate to their skills and knowledge. Nonetheless, a more holistic view on what constitutes good teaching practice has challenged whether this approach to user modelling is sufficient. Teaching is not only defined by what is taught, but also by how it is taught. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploratory design research can support this view by generating a more inclusive set of user attributes for purposes of user modelling. Through a case study, we show that design research for user modelling can function as a boundary object serving three important roles that underpin more specifically the design of user modelling and more broadly ITS design. First, design research can establish common ground by encapsulating domain knowledge in an accessible form. This can support diverse project stakeholders to make decisions on what is to be modelled. Secondly, design research can reveal a wide range of teaching and learning perspectives that in turn introduce transparency to the decision-making process of user modelling and provoke a sense of criticality and accountability amongst project stakeholders. Thirdly, design research can build new bridges between the design of the technology and the user model that underpins it. To this end, user attributes deemed important, yet too complex or cumbersome to develop, can become design principles in the context of the overall ITS design. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS We highlight how the creation of user models rarely incorporates assistance from the HCI community. We present a series of design activities intended to assist in the creation of a User Model. We examine how this design-oriented methodology creates a boundary object. We discuss the three benefits this boundary object brings to constructing user models, namely establishing common ground, creating transparency when considering possible alternatives and creating a springboard for new activities.},

  abstract={This paper proposes an approach for developing curriculum-level open student models. This approach entails evaluating student core competencies using the correspondence between courses and core competencies in a competency-based curriculum and students' taken courses and grades. On the basis of this approach, a curriculum-level, competency-based visualized analytic system, called visualized analytics of core competencies (VACCs), was implemented. Course-competency diagnostic tools, course work performance radar charts, and peer-based ranking tables were developed as part of the VACC analytic system for student reflection and to position their levels of core competencies. These curriculum-level open student models revealed multiple aspects of students' core competencies by monitoring the quantity and quality of courses taken by students, and evaluating students' ranks regarding core competencies compared with their classmates and graduates. VACC evaluation was conducted in this paper. The results showed that more than 70% of students reported that VACC helped in reflecting on their core competencies, assisting them in understanding the correspondence between their taken courses and core competencies, and helping them to set goals regarding taking additional courses. In addition, this paper discusses potential analytics and applications of open student models of core competencies.},

  abstract={Existing tools aim to detect university students with early diagnosis of dyslexia or reading difficulties, but there are not developed tools that let those students better understand some aspects of their difficulties. In this paper, a dashboard for visualizing and inspecting early detected reading difficulties and their characteristics, called PADA (acronym for the Spanish name Panel de Analíticas de Aprendizaje de Dislexia en Adultos), is presented. PADA is a web-based tool designed to facilitate the creation of descriptive visualizations required for a better understanding by students about their learner model. Through information visualization techniques, PADA shows students the knowledge in their learner models in order to help them to increase their awareness and to support reflection and self-regulation about their difficulties in reading. PADA provides different learning analytics on reading performance of students, so that they can self-identify their strengths and weaknesses and self-regulate their learning. This paper describes examples that cover a variety of visualizations (bar-charts, line-charts, and pie-charts) to show user model fragments as personal details, reading profiles, learning styles, and cognitive traits of the students. We tested PADA with 26 students (aged 21-53 years) of different academic programs and levels, dyslexic and non-dyslexic. The results show that PADA can assist students in creating awareness, and help them to understand their difficulties associated with the reading tasks, as well as facilitate reflection and self-regulation in the learning process. Implications for the design of learning analytics are discussed and directions for future work are outlined.},

  abstract={Data mining is known to have a potential for predicting user performance. However, there are few studies that explore its potential for predicting student behavior in a procedural training environment. This paper presents a collective student model, which is built from past student logs. These logs are first grouped into clusters. Then, an extended automaton is created for each cluster based on the sequences of events found in the cluster logs. The main objective of this model is to predict the actions of new students for improving the tutoring feedback provided by an intelligent tutoring system. The proposed model has been validated using student logs collected in a 3D virtual laboratory for teaching biotechnology. As a result of this validation, we concluded that the model can provide reasonably good predictions and can support tutoring feedback that is better adapted to each student type.},

  abstract={Adaptive educational hypermedia (AEH) has been an alternative tool to replace conventional learning tools. It mainly offers adaptive navigation and presentation based on a wide range of characteristics, preferences and understanding of learners. The adaptation is enabled by a user model which records users' characteristics, domain models which represent all concepts taught in a course and relationships among them, and goal and adaptation models that infer domain and user models to produce adaptation. The main adaptation offered in AEH deals with where a learner can go next. However, it does not inform learners how far they are from the goals. This paper addresses the problem of finding the shortest path to reach a learning goal. We propose a modified Dijkstra algorithm applied to a graph-based domain model. It takes account of learners' knowledge, the weight of topics in a course and the influence scores of each topic to learn the other topics to predict the possibility of success in learning a topic. Based on the success possibility scores, learning paths are recommended to students. Since students' knowledge is progressive, the success possibility scores are dynamics and they will result in a dynamic learning path adaptive to students' progress.},

We then examine how the agreement between the teacher's best labels and the original labels affects the student model's performance. Next, we show that knowledge distillation can be easily applied to semi-supervised learning to improve model performance. We also propose a promising data selection method to filter un-transcribed data. Then we focus on knowledge transfer among DNN models with multilingual features derived from CNN+DNN, LSTM, VGG, CTC and attention models. We show that a student model equipped with better input features not only learns better from the teacher's labels, but also outperforms the teacher. Further experiments suggest that by learning from each other, the original ensemble of various models is able to evolve into a new ensemble with even better combined performance.},

  abstract={We describe the architecture of a small remote laboratory made available by means of a web-based adaptive system (Mindlab2). The system supports hands-on e-learning experiences with robotics and automation, performed via internet. It allows the learners to access and solve “problems”, submit their solutions and have them evaluated. The problems are defined by the teacher, also specifying instructional aspects, such as the learner's skills involved in producing a solution. For each individual learner a personal Student Model is maintained, recording learner's knowledge and skills, as shown by the solved problems. The access to the problem is guarded by the system, ensuring that the problems can all be “seen” by any student, whereas a learner can work on a problem only if its prerequisites are covered, or anyway “not too far” from her current competences. The available automata are modular structures of various origin (a robotic arm connected to an Arduino platform, and some Lego MindStorm builds, in various configurations). Such hardware is reasonably sophisticated in terms of functions, enjoys a wide provision of sensors and actuators, so allowing for presenting the learners with a good deal of problems, and is sufficiently affordable in terms of cost. Making the learner choose and sequence the problems to undertake, with the only limitation of the problem affordability measured by the student model, allows learners to follow a highly personalizable learning path in a pedagogically controlled setting, which we submit is conducive to better engagement and learning results.},

  abstract={Sharing economy becomes an emerging issue in urban life. It is not a new phenomenon but an assembling of existing techniques to meet specific demands of users. It also points out a better way to implicitly collect users' contexts and to understand users than the conventional one that requires much user involvement (e.g., tedious inputs). A universal model, for this purpose, that supports dynamic analysis and mining of user-generated content (or contexts) is designed in this paper. Two major factors, sensing and analysis of crowd preference and their decision-making behavior, are especially targeted. This model formulates the given scenario that comprehensively illustrates the possible actors and correlated actions among them with a set of rules to enhance the machine learning results. This model outlines a detail process on pre-/post-process of the data, and indicates the core techniques for user modeling. The raw data collected from on-service website, i.e., Airbnb, are utilized for the preliminary examination of our proposal. We especially look at internal factors (e.g., nationality, gender, and age) and external factors (e.g., device, social media, and time) that reflect implicitly the difference on crowd's preference and behavior. Results after statistics-based machine learning reveal that the relation among users' internal and external factors share high similarity with their behavior patterns, and can be applied, considering particular features, for service provision to a specific type of crowds.},

In this manner, this article presents an approach for predicting academic performance based on ontologies and Bayesian networks. A knowledge assessment module was developed and integrated to a Ubiquitous Learning Environment (ULE) in real and actual use. During three semesters, five graduate classes were analyzed with the intent of verifying the correlation between the grades generated by the module and the actual grades obtained by the students. It was noted that 80% of the analyzed samples obtained very high or substantial correlations. This indicates that the proposed module is adequate for identifying and predicting academic performance.},

  abstract={Since last two decades virtual education has brought with it big challenges for higher education, which suppose having in mind the feasibility of delivering digital scenarios that adjusts to learner's characteristics. Thus, our first concern involves distinguishing heterogeneity of student's characteristics who can access this modal of education. Other issue to have in mind is to provide a Learning Management Systems (LMS) that can be adapted to student's characteristics from that diversity. This paper focuses on presenting a learner model with regards to educational special needs, in order to achieve some adaptation through an LMS. The model was built based on a particular data set identified in previous studies done, that include: demographics, competences, reading profile, learning styles, and cognitive traits [1]. The main objective of this model is to bring adaptive recommendations, provided through a LMS, aimed to higher education students with some learning difficulties, particularly those who have dyslexia or reading difficulties.},

  abstract={Java language course is a professional course of computer science. Usually, the teacher encounters how to give learners insights into the language grammatical structure and how to find a proper way to help learners grasp a new kind of skill. To address this problem, learners' learning styles and competences should be focused on. In this paper, we propose a new Java language teaching scheme based on the learners' learning styles and competences. Furthermore, we develop a new learner model which is the core of the proposed adaptive learning system. The system was developed for Java language teaching and we implemented an experiment to identify its effectiveness. The experimental result shows that learners' ability of solving practical application problems and the enthusiasm of learning Java language have been significantly improved. Teachers can also be accurate and objective in the evaluation of learners' learning.},

  abstract={In the era of E-Learning, most research on learner model is focused on the analysis of learning-related data, but ignored the analysis of the multidimensional data and relationship among them. This will make it difficult to constructing dynamic, real-time and accurate learner model. However, in the era of U-Learning, the learning device has powerful ability of sensing the context awareness. With these context-awareness technologies, the U-Learning system can collect multi-sensor data intelligently, and then analyze these data by ubiquitous computing, providing learners with timely and accurately personalized study guide. With the wide use of context-awareness technology in the education field, this paper discusses how to use context-aware technology to design dynamic and accurate individualized learner model. Firstly, we describe the contextual factors and classification involved in the U-Learning environment, and then analyze the relationship of contextual factors and learner characteristics. Secondly, we choose an appropriate algorithm to analyze the multi-sensor data which sense and identify learner context automatically, discussing the design of dynamic and real-time learner model by pattern matching and context reasoning. Finally, we propose a framework of learner model which is based on the analysis result of context-aware computing, and then focus on the design prototype system to enhance U-Learning system of adaptive ability.},

  abstract={MOOC is characterized by large amount of users and curriculums. The current main MOOC platforms are divided into information isolated island. So how to dynamic uniformly recommend courses to users that he or she is interested in, which is one of the challenges of such teaching network nowadays. MOOC course recommender system is a kind of knowledge service system based on the recommended models so as to solve the problem of overloaded course information and increased efficiency of searching. Social work profession is strong comprehensive and traditional classroom learning needs being with the help of Internet resources to conduct independent learning. This article adopts B/S architectural pattern, and designs a personalized MOOC resource recommender system for social work major which is based on the popular learner model. It respectively uses the present prevalent algorithms such as collaborative filtering recommendation by the user and commodity filtering recommendation to analyze users' historical preference information. Design and setup process of the system is inspiring. That can act as guidance to the practice of MOOC or other resources recommender system in many professions with users of different levels.},

  abstract={To serve large user populations, autonomous intervention systems (i.e. intelligent agents) are being developed to play more active roles such as fitness coaches and clinical disease prevention aids. Although generic user models have been developed, users may require extensive individualization to meet their personal needs. Machine learning techniques may be applied to learn tailored intervention policies for users. However, traditional machine learning requires significant amounts of data to learn an optimal policy. For wearable technology, this may mean probing the user to perform some activity and gauging user response. This paper presents a feasible intervention system model and discusses learners for tailoring user intervention policies. We examine how similar the general user model has to be with respect to the tailored model in order for our learner to perform well.},

  abstract={This paper contributes to the development of randomized methods for neural networks. The proposed learner model is generated incrementally by stochastic configuration (SC) algorithms, termed SC networks (SCNs). In contrast to the existing randomized learning algorithms for single layer feed-forward networks, we randomly assign the input weights and biases of the hidden nodes in the light of a supervisory mechanism, and the output weights are analytically evaluated in either a constructive or selective manner. As fundamentals of SCN-based data modeling techniques, we establish some theoretical results on the universal approximation property. Three versions of SC algorithms are presented for data regression and classification problems in this paper. Simulation results concerning both data regression and classification indicate some remarkable merits of our proposed SCNs in terms of less human intervention on the network size setting, the scope adaptation of random parameters, fast learning, and sound generalization.},

  title={Predicting Student Performance in an ITS Using Task-Driven Features},

  abstract={Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are typically designed to offer one-on-one tutoring on a subject to students in an adaptive way so that students can learn the subject at their own pace. The ability to predict student performance enables an ITS to make informed decisions towards meeting the individual needs of students. It is also useful for ITS designers to validate if students are actually able to succeed in learning the subject. Predicting student performance is a function of two complex and dynamic factors: (f1) student learning behavior and (f2) their current knowledge in the subject. Learning behavior is captured from student interaction with the ITS (e.g. time spent on an assigned task) and is stored in the form of web logs. Student knowledge in the subject is represented by the marks they score in assigned tasks and is stored in a specific component of the ITS called student model. In order to build an accurate prediction model, this raw data from student model and web logs must be engineered carefully and transformed into meaningful features. Existing systems such as LON-CAPA predict students performance using their learning behavior alone, without considering their (current) knowledge on the subject. Lack of proper feature engineering is evident from the low values of accuracy of their prediction models. This research proposes a highly accurate model that predicts student success in assigned tasks with a 96% accuracy by using features that are better informed not only about students in terms of the two factors f1 and f2 mentioned above, but also on the assigned task itself (e.g. task's difficulty level). In order to accomplish this, an Example Recommendation System (ERS) is designed with a fine-grained student model (to represent student data) and a fine-grained domain model (to represent domain resources such as tasks).},

A good user model can reflect the preference information accurate and comprehensive, which can obtain user preference characteristics information and can reflect the real characteristics and requirements effectively. User interest model can guide users to obtain information which is in line with the characteristics of their own interest, so that the information can be more active. The construction of user interest model generally includes information collection, user interest model representation, model learning and updating. A personalized user interest model based on user attribute information and learning resources domain ontology is researched and constructed for the prediction of user behavior changes is inaccurate, algorithm space complexity is high, the analysis of the user behavior impact is not accurate and comprehensive.
