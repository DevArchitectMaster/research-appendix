  abstract={Digital twin (DT) technology has recently gathered pace in the engineering communities as it allows for the convergence of the real structure and its digital counterpart throughout their entire life-cycle. With the rapid development of supporting technologies, including machine learning (ML), 5G/6G, cloud computing, and Internet of Things, DT has been moving progressively from concept to practice. In this article, a DT framework based on cloud computing and deep learning (DL) for structural health monitoring is proposed to efficiently perform real-time monitoring and proactive maintenance. The framework consists of structural components, device measurements, and digital models formed by combining different submodels, including mathematical, finite element, and ML ones. The data interaction among physical structure, digital model, and human interventions are enhanced by using cloud computing infrastructure and a user-friendly web application. The feasibility of the proposed framework is demonstrated via case studies of damage detection of model bridge and real bridge structures using DL algorithms, with high accuracy of 92%.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), the digital twin is emerging as one of the most promising technologies to connect physical components with digital space for better optimization of physical systems. However, the limited wireless resource and security concerns impede the deployment of the digital twin in IoT. In this article, we exploit blockchain to propose a new digital twin edge networks framework for enabling flexible and secure digital twin construction. We first develop cooperative federated learning through an access point (AP) to help resource-limited smart devices in constructing digital twin at the network edges belonging to different mobile network operators (MNOs). Then, we propose a model update chain by leveraging directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain to secure both local model updates and global model updates. In order to incentivize the APs to help in local models training for resource-limited smart devices and also encourage the APs to contribute resource in local model update verification, we design an iterative double auction-based joint cooperative federated learning and local model update verification scheme. The optimal unified time for cooperative federated learning and local model update verification is solved to maximize social welfare. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme is efficient in digital twin construction.},

  volume={19},
  number={4},
  pages={3471-3482},
  abstract={This paper introduces a novel practice of using image based condition classification and visualization system to augment operators in the task of monitoring the working condition of fused magnesium furnace. The system implements two functions: working condition detection and remote visually reconstruction of the furnace flame. For the problem of working condition detection, we combine the image features and the smelting electrical currents to train the classifier under semi-supervised learning framework. We also introduce a highly efficient cross-entropy based optimization method for training. For the visualization task, we propose a practical end-to-end solution which can visually simulate the dynamic furnace flame at remote monitoring consoles according to the visual feature of the monitoring video. Finally, we introduce the distributed structure of the monitoring system which consists of a private cloud, an edge server and remote monitoring consoles. The proposed solution can be applicable for various monitoring tasks in industry. Note to Practitioners—This paper introduces an image based solution to the practical problem of condition monitoring of fused magnesium furnace. The solution includes two parts: working condition detection and visualization. First, for the abnormal condition detection problem, most existing approaches use the process monitoring video as the condition predictor. It also assumes that the video data are fully labeled with condition category, which often is not available in practice. This paper suggests a novel approach combining the monitoring video and the smelting electrical currents under semi-supervised learning framework to the development of condition classifier. Experiments show that the detection accuracy is remarkably improved comparing to the approach using monitoring video only. Second, this paper presents a remote visualization solution which enables instant reconstruction of the furnace flame at monitoring consoles using only essential features of the flame. This technique is well suited for situation of real-time remote visual monitoring with very limited network bandwidth. Finally, the condition monitoring system adopts a distributed structure including a private cloud, an edge server and remote monitoring consoles. The presented techniques in this paper can be applicable for various monitoring tasks in industry.},

  year={2022},
  volume={9},
  number={13},
  pages={11141-11153},
  abstract={Over the past decades, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in both military and civilian fields. In these applications, flocking motion is a fundamental but crucial operation of multi-UAV systems. Traditional flocking motion methods usually designed for a specific environment. However, the real environment is mostly unknown and stochastic, which greatly reduces the practicality of these methods. In this article, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to realize the flocking motion of multi-UAV systems. Considering that the sim-to-real problem restricts the application of DRL to the flocking motion scenario, a digital twin (DT)-enabled DRL training framework is proposed to solve this problem. The DRL model can learn from DT and be quickly deployed on the real-world UAV with the help of DT. Under this training framework, this article proposes an actor–critic DRL algorithm, named behavior-coupling deep deterministic policy gradient (BCDDPG), for the flocking motion problem, which is inspired by the flocking behavior of animals. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of BCDDPG. Simulation results show that BCDDPG achieves a higher average reward and performs better in terms of arrival rate and collision rate compared with the existing methods.},

  abstract={In order to improve the intelligence and humanization of the home environment, smart air conditioners are used as the research objects. User needs using the theory of Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) are investigated and researched, and smart air conditioners are researched and practiced on human interaction design. Firstly, in order to establish a user model, the questions and needs of the target users are explored through the questionnaire survey method. Secondly, from the perspective of ergonomics, the hardware and software interaction interface of the smart air conditioner is analyzed. Finally, the intelligent air conditioner is designed for HCI according to user needs, and the unsupervised feature value extraction of the vibration measurement signal of the outdoor unit of the household air conditioner is carried out by using the stacked autoencoder neural network. Three preliminary options for the design of remote controllers for air conditioners are proposed, and the fuzzy evaluation method is utilized to analyze and evaluate the three options. The research results show that the comprehensive evaluation results of the three preliminary options of the remote-control design are 0.78, 0.77, and 0.8 respectively. Compared with Option 1 and Option 2, Option 3 has obvious advantages. The design of Option 3 is more prominent in terms of comfort, aesthetics, and rationality. Therefore, Option 3 is selected as the final design solution. Under different hidden layer numbers and node numbers, the classification accuracy rate changes in a convex function. When the number of layers is 3 and the number of nodes is 100, the classification accuracy rate is the highest. According to the needs of users, a specific interactive design analysis is carried out on the hardware design of home appliances from the perspective of ergonomics.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT) provides accurate guidance for multidimensional resource scheduling in 5G edge computing-empowered distribution grids by establishing a digital representation of the physical entities.

SAINT achieves low-latency, accurate, and secure DT by jointly optimizing its total iteration delay and loss function, and leveraging abnormal model recognition (AMR). SAINT enables intelligent resource scheduling by using DT to improve the learning performance of deep Q-learning. SAINT supports access priority and energy consumption awareness due to the consideration of long-term constraints. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, SAINT has superior performance in cumulative iteration delay, DT loss function, energy consumption, and access priority deficit.},

  abstract={A cyber digital twin is a bridge connecting cyber and physical space, and it also provides a paradigm for intelligent service-oriented future network architectures. This article proposes a cyber digital twin-based future network architecture to support cross-space intelligent services and manage cross-space resources to meet the demand for diversified intelligent services. The cyber digital twin is introduced as a smart communication agent in the edge network to handle all physical object communication; thus, all the physical object data is acquired by its cyber digital twin. To meet the demand for diversified intelligent services, the proposed network architecture consists of a service analytical model, cross-space resource representation and management, and an autonomous configuration model. The service analytical model realizes the intelligent matching of new service requirements to resource requirements. Furthermore, the cross-space resource representation and management mechanism is based on reinforcement learning to ensure cross-space service consistency and resource utilization efficiency. Finally, the autonomous configuration model provides a unified intelligent configuration method for a large number of complex operations with cross-space devices. This article also proposes a cross-space resource management scheme that utilizes reinforcement learning to learn the optimal resource allocation strategy.

  abstract={Following the fourth industrial revolution, and with the recent advances in information and communication technologies, the digital twinning concept is attracting the attention of both academia and industry worldwide. A microgrid digital twin (MGDT) refers to the digital representation of a microgrid (MG), which mirrors the behavior of its physical counterpart by using high-fidelity models and simulation platforms as well as real-time bi-directional data exchange with the real twin. With the massive deployment of sensor networks and IoT technologies in MGs, a huge volume of data is continuously generated, which contains valuable information to enhance the performance of MGs. MGDTs provide a powerful tool to manage the huge historical data and real-time data stream in an efficient and secure manner and support MGs’ operation by assisting in their design, operation management, and maintenance. In this paper, the concept of the digital twin (DT) and its key characteristics are introduced. Moreover, a workflow for establishing MGDTs is presented. The goal is to explore different applications of DTs in MGs, namely in design, control, operator training, forecasting, fault diagnosis, expansion planning, and policy-making. Besides, an up-to-date overview of studies that applied the DT concept to power systems and specifically MGs is provided. Considering the significance of situational awareness, security, and resilient operation for MGs, their potential enhancement in light of digital twinning is thoroughly analyzed and a conceptual model for resilient operation management of MGs is presented. Finally, future trends in MGDTs are discussed.},

  pages={500-515},
  abstract={Deep face forgery and detection is an emerging topic due to the development of GANs. Face forgery detection relies greatly on existing databases for evaluation and adequate training examples for data-hungry machine learning algorithms. However, considering the wide application of face recognition in near-infrared scenarios, there is no publicly available face forgery database that includes near-infrared modality currently. In this paper, we present an attempt at constructing a large-scale dataset for face forgery detection in the near-infrared modality and propose a new forgery detection method based on knowledge distillation named cross-modality knowledge distillation aiming to use a teacher model which is pre-trained on the visible light-based (VIS) big data to guide the student model with a small amount of near-infrared (NIR) data. The proposed near-infrared face forgery dataset, named ForgeryNIR, contains a total of over 50,000 real and fake identities. A number of perturbations are applied to help simulate real-world scenarios. All source images in ForgeryNIR are collected from CASIA NIR-VIS 2.0, and fake images are generated via multiple GAN techniques. The proposed dataset fills the gap of face forgery detection research in the near-infrared modality. A comprehensive study on six representative detection baselines is conducted to evaluate the performance of face forgery detection algorithms in the NIR domain. We further construct a hard testing set, named ForgeryNIR+, which contains forged images that have bypassed existing face forgery detection methods. The proposed datasets will be publicly available and aim to help boost further research on face forgery detection, as well as NIR face detection and recognition.},

In addition, the spatial–temporal information obtained is leveraged to activate location-based services that can help promote operational efficiency. Moreover, a real-life case study is carried out in a world-leading computer manufacturer’s factory to illustrate the viability and practicality of the system and methods proposed, with hardware and software developed.

  abstract={Wind turbines are one of the primary sources of renewable energy, which leads to a sustainable and efficient energy solution. It does not release any carbon emissions to pollute our planet. The wind farms monitoring and power generation prediction is a complex problem due to the unpredictability of wind speed. Consequently, it limits the decision power of the management team to plan the energy consumption in an effective way. Our proposed model solves this challenge by utilizing a 5G-Next Generation-Radio Access Network (5G-NG-RAN) assisted cloud-based digital twins’ framework to virtually monitor wind turbines and form a predictive model to forecast wind speed and predict the generated power. The developed model is based on Microsoft Azure digital twins infrastructure as a 5-dimensional digital twins platform. The predictive modeling is based on a deep learning approach, temporal convolution network (TCN) followed by a non-parametric k-nearest neighbor (kNN) regression. Predictive modeling has two components. First, it processes the univariate time series data of wind to predict its speed. Secondly, it estimates the power generation for each quarter of the year ranges from one week to a whole month (i.e., medium-term prediction) To evaluate the framework the experiments are performed on onshore wind turbines publicly available datasets. The obtained results confirm the applicability of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the comparative analysis with the existing classical prediction models shows that our designed approach obtained better results. The model can assist the management team to monitor the wind farms remotely as well as estimate the power generation in advance.},

  abstract={Internet of Everything (IoE) applications such as haptics, human-computer interaction, and extended reality, using the sixth-generation (6G) of wireless systems have diverse requirements in terms of latency, reliability, data rate, and user-defined performance metrics. Therefore, enabling IoE applications over 6G requires a new framework that can be used to manage, operate, and optimize the 6G wireless system and its underlying IoE services. Such a new framework for 6G can be based on digital twins. Digital twins use a virtual representation of the 6G physical system along with the associated algorithms (e.g., machine learning, optimization), communication technologies (e.g., millimeter-wave and terahertz communication), computing systems (e.g., edge computing and cloud computing), as well as privacy and security-related technologists (e.g., blockchain). First, we present the key design requirements for enabling 6G through the use of a digital twin.

  pages={905-921},
  abstract={Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a promising paradigm that enables the employment of novel service types with lower deployment cost and faster time-to-value, but it introduces new fault management problems and challenges. In NFV environment, anomalies occurred in virtual machines (VMs) can be caused by faulty components of their hosting servers or anomaly propagation from other ones. If the performance of VMs degrades, we need to find out the root causes accurately, i.e., locate the exact faulty components, to recover the networks as soon as possible. In this paper, we first use digital twin to establish a virtual instance of the physical network to capture the real-time anomaly-fault dependency relationship. When the network environment changes, transfer learning is leveraged to utilize the learned knowledge of dependency relationship in historical periods to avoid huge time and computation cost of learning from scratch. Assisted by the learned dependency relationship, a dynamic set-covering (DSC) based root caused analysis problem is formulated and modeled with a set of parallel hidden Markov models to capture the dynamics of component states, which can best explain the sequence of anomalous VMs. We use alternating direction method of multipliers to decompose the DSC problem into a set of independent sub-problems and solve it in a distributed fashion. Since the state variables of each component in the DSC problem are coupled between any two successive time epochs, each sub-problem is solved by the Viterbi decoding and an incremental function is designed to construct the feasible solution that covers all anomalous VMs. Simulation results show the availability and superiority of the digital-twin assisted root cause analysis algorithm for NFV environment.},

  abstract={There has been much interest in deploying deep learning algorithms on low-powered devices, including smart-phones, drones, and medical sensors. However, full-scale deep neural networks are often too resource-intensive in terms of energy and storage. As a result, the bulk part of the machine learning operation is therefore often carried out on an edge server, where the data is compressed and transmitted. However, compressing data (such as images) leads to transmitting information irrelevant to the supervised task. Another popular approach is to split the deep network between the device and the server while compressing intermediate features. To date, however, such split computing strategies have barely outperformed the aforementioned naive data compression baselines due to their inefficient approaches to feature compression. This paper adopts ideas from knowledge distillation and neural image compression to compress intermediate feature representations more efficiently. Our supervised compression approach uses a teacher model and a student model with a stochastic bottleneck and learnable prior for entropy coding (Entropic Student). We compare our approach to various neural image and feature compression baselines in three vision tasks and found that it achieves better supervised rate-distortion performance while maintaining smaller end-to-end latency. We furthermore show that the learned feature representations can be tuned to serve multiple downstream tasks.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers knowledge of a teacher model to improve performance of a student model which is usually equipped with lower capacity. In the KD framework, however, it is unclear what kind of knowledge is effective and how it is transferred. This paper analyzes a KD process to explore the key factors. In a KD formulation, softmax temperature entangles three main components of student and teacher probabilities and a weight for KD, making it hard to analyze contributions of those factors separately. We disentangle those components so as to further analyze especially the temperature and improve the components respectively. Based on the analysis about temperature and uniformity of the teacher probability, we propose a method, called extractive distillation, for extracting effective knowledge from the teacher model. The extractive KD touches only teacher knowledge, thus being applicable to various KD methods. In the experiments on image classification tasks using Cifar-100 and TinyImageNet datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the other KD methods and analyze feature representation to show its effectiveness in the framework of transfer learning.},

  abstract={The whole is greater than the sum of its parts" is a common summation of Aristotle’s famous thought. This phrase is now following reality. Working together has versatile advantages allowing us to examine things from divergent aspects and perspectives supported by the strengths of participating individuals. For complex tasks, simple digital platforms allowing to share documents, text, speech, and video are often not sufficient. Tasks including operation on sophisticated machines and other equipment are evident examples of this. These sophisticated machines are not necessarily physically available for everyone. However, digital alternatives of them can be. When connected with the physical world, enabling data flow in both directions and therefore implemented as digital twins, these systems allow true collaboration between people and machines independent of physical location. In this paper, digital twin implementations enabling efficient remote collaboration between two organizations are reported. These systems are not limited to research and education. Instead, utilization for remote deployment and maintenance tasks are possible.},

  abstract={Scene classification is an active research topic in the remote sensing community, and complex spatial layouts with various types of objects bring huge challenges to classification. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods attempt to explore the global features by gradually expanding the receptive field, while long-range contextual information is ignored. Vision transformer (ViT) can extract contextual features, but the learning ability of local information is limited, and it has a large computational complexity simultaneously. In this article, an end-to-end method is exploited by employing ViT as an excellent teacher for guiding small networks (ET-GSNet) in the remote sensing image scene classification. In the ET-GSNet, ResNet18 is selected as the student model, which integrates the superiorities of the two models via knowledge distillation (KD), and the computational complexity does not increase. In the KD process, the ViT and ResNet18 are optimized together without independent pretraining, and the learning rate of teacher model gradually decreases until zero, while the weight coefficient of the KD loss module is doubled. Based on the above procedures, dark knowledge from the teacher model can be transferred to the student model more smoothly. Experimental results on the four public remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed ET-GSNet method possesses the superior classification performance compared to some state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In addition, we evaluate the ET-GSNet on a fine-grained ship recognition dataset, and the results show that our method has good generalization for different tasks in terms of some metrics.},

  abstract={Saliency prediction models aim to mimic the human visual system’s attention process, and the research has made significant progress due to recent advancements in deep convolution neural networks. However, the high memory requirements and intensive computational demands make these approaches less suitable for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, and there is a need for an improved computational efficiency and reduced memory footprint to facilitate distributed IoT intelligence. This article proposes a pseudoknowledge distillation (PKD) training method for creating a compact real-time saliency prediction model. The proposed method can effectively transfer knowledge from computationally expensive once-for-all (OFA-595) as a single teacher model and a combination of OFA-595 and EfficientNet-B7 as a multiteacher model to an early exit evolutionary algorithm network student model by utilizing knowledge distillation and pseudolabeling. Five saliency benchmark datasets are used to demonstrate PKD’s improved prediction performance and its reduced inference time without modifying the original student model.},

  abstract={Image guided depth completion aims to generate a dense depth map from a sparse one with the guidance of a color image. Previous high-accuracy methods often rely on complex networks that are large in size and expensive in computational cost, making them inapplicable to real-time platforms. In this letter, we propose a self-paced knowledge distillation method, which obtains a lightweight but accurate depth completion model via distilling knowledge from a complex teacher network. Specifically, by taking advantage of the easy-to-hard learning curriculum in deep networks, we first design a groundtruth-free hard-pixel mining module to tell hard and noisy pixels in the teacher’s output. Then, we design two self-paced distillation losses, which gradually introduce hard pixels to distill the depth and structure knowledge from the teacher to the compact student network. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that the proposed method can improve the original student model by a considerable margin. The distilled compact and real-time student model outperforms all previous lightweight networks, mitigating the performance gap with state-of-the-art high-accuracy but complex models.},

  abstract={operating real hardware is a fundamental engineering skill. For this reason, hands-on classes involving real equipment is an essential tool in engineering education. At the same time in many cases there are certain limitations related to in-person training of students: hardware availability, hardly modifiable functionality for each student and educational goal, the increased demand on remote learning and safety aspects. Modern information technologies enable various means for partially solving the mentioned issues by providing remote access, VR-technologies, digital twins, etc. The paper provides a brief overview of aspects related to introducing virtual labs into educational process, with the main focus on the requirement for the virtual hardware, such as an electric power drive system, should replicate processes with time resolution in order of several milliseconds. And the interaction of the equipment with the student should be done in a way there is a feeling of a real object, necessitating low response time in order of hundreds of milliseconds. This requires high priority of computational power allocation for mathematical model calculation as well as high communication channel bandwidth between the computation power source and the user interface. The paper presents an example of such a server deployed virtual laboratory. The functionality was inspired by that of real equipment installed at Energy saving electric power drive laboratory at the Department of Electric Drives of Moscow Power Engineering Institute. Apart from substantively replicating the functionality and feel of high-dynamic hardware real-time operation, it enables to provide each student with an individual virtual equipment set to be explored, tuned or diagnosed. Virtual labs of the kind proved to be an effective engineering education tool for remote learning, giving new opportunities in improving the in-person training process as well.},

  abstract={A Digital Twin is a digital replica of a living or nonliving physical entity, and this emerging technology attracted extensive attention from different industries during the past decade. Although a few Digital Twin studies have been conducted in the transportation domain very recently, there is no systematic research with a holistic framework connecting various mobility entities together. In this study, a mobility digital twin (MDT) framework is developed, which is defined as an artificial intelligence (AI)-based data-driven cloud–edge–device framework for mobility services. This MDT consists of three building blocks in the physical space (namely, Human, Vehicle, and Traffic), and their associated Digital Twins in the digital space. An example cloud–edge architecture is built with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to accommodate the proposed MDT framework and to fulfill its digital functionalities of storage, modeling, learning, simulation, and prediction. A case study of the personalized adaptive cruise control (P-ACC) system is conducted, which integrates the key microservices of all three digital building blocks of the MDT framework: 1) the Human Digital Twin with user management and driver type classification; 2) the Vehicle Digital Twin with cloud-based advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS); and 3) the Traffic Digital Twin with traffic flow monitoring and variable speed limit. Future challenges of the proposed MDT framework are discussed toward the end of the article, including standardization, AI for computing, public or private cloud service, and network heterogeneity.},

  pages={29646-29667},
  abstract={Privacy protection, high labeling cost, and varying characteristics of seizures among patients and at different times are the main obstacles to building seizure detection models. Considering these issues, we propose a novel Mentor-Student architecture for Patient-Specific seizure detection (MS4PS). It contains a new method of knowledge transferring called mentor-select-for-student, which exploits the knowledge of a mentor model by using this model to select data for training a student model, making it possible to avoid transferring patient data and the negative influence of transferring parameters/structures of pre-trained models. It also contains a new method of active learning, which uses both an experienced mentor model and a quick-learning student model to select high-quality samples for doctors to label. Each of the two models is coupled with a particular sample selection strategy that combines uncertainty/certainty and the distance between the unlabeled samples and labeled seizure samples. The proposed method can quickly train a suitable detector for a patient at his/her first epilepsy diagnosis with the help of: (1) an experienced mentor model that chooses the most category-certain electroencephalography (EEG) data segments; (2) a student model (detector itself) that chooses the most category-uncertain EEG data segments; (3) doctors who label these data segments selected by both the mentor model and student model. By replacing or improving the mentor model and refining the historical models of patients when they come next time, the MS4PS system can be sustainably promoted. The proposed method is tested on the CHB-MIT and NEO datasets, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract={To better support the emerging vehicular applications and multimedia services, vehicular edge computing (VEC) provides computing and caching services in proximity to vehicles, by reducing network transmission latency and alleviating network congestion. However, current VEC networks may face some implementation challenges, such as high mobility of vehicles, dynamic vehicular environment, and complex network scheduling. Digital twin, as an emerging technology, can make the virtual representation of physical networks to predict, estimate, and analyze the real-time network state. In this paper, we integrate digital twin into VEC networks to adaptively make network management and policy schedule. We first introduce the framework of VEC networks and present the key problems in a VEC network. Next, we give the concept of digital twin and propose an adaptive digital twin-enabled VEC network. In the proposed network, digital twin can enable adaptive network management via the two-closed loops between physical VEC networks and digital twins. Further, we propose a digital twin empowered VEC offloading problem with vehicle digital models and road side unit (RSU) digital models. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based offloading scheme is designed to minimize the total offloading latency. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DRL-based algorithm for VEC offloading.},

  pages={36188-36199},
  abstract={Anomaly detection is an integral part of a number of surveillance applications. However, most of the existing anomaly detection models are statically trained on pre-recorded data from a single source, thus making multiple assumptions about the surrounding environment. As a result, their usefulness is limited to controlled scenarios. In this paper, we fuse information from live streams of audio and video data to detect anomalies in the captured environment. We train a deep learning-based teacher-student network using video, image, and audio information. The pre-trained visual network in the teacher model distills its information to the image and audio networks in the student model. Features from image and audio networks are combined and compressed using principal component analysis. Thus, the teacher-student network produces an image-audio-based light-weight joint representation of the data. The data dynamics are learned in a multivariate adaptive Gaussian mixture model. Empirical results from two audio-visual datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of joint representation over single modalities in the adaptive anomaly detection framework. The proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by an average of 15.00 % and 14.52 % in AUC values for dataset 1 and dataset 2, respectively.},

  abstract={The precise control of a complex system requires a good numerical model with elegant consideration of the individual uniqueness. A data-driven online machine learning (OML) framework is proposed in this paper to achieve this goal. A set of UVLED reliability testing data is applied to verify the feasibility of the OML concept. Moreover, the design guidelines are then deduced.The OML model is built based on neural network (NN) architecture. The genetic algorithm (GA) and the principal component analysis (PCA) are applied to obtain the optimal NN initial weighting parameters. After hundreds of iterations, this model is defined as the based model of ML. Through careful investigation of the evolution of the NN parameters at each iteration, the feasibility of OML for engineering applications is validated. Moreover, the basic strategy for OML has been established, including the continuous monitoring of the weighting change and the prediction error. The result shows that only 1,000-hour data is required to predict the individual LED performance of 3,000 hours with acceptable accuracy.},

  abstract={Soil moisture (SM) is an important parameter used to control a broad range of environmental applications. An increasing attention has been recently given to machine learning (ML) methods for SM retrieval that provide promising performance. Nevertheless, most of them are based on a supervised learning strategies that depend on the used labeled training samples. In fact, they are unaffordable or costly. In this letter, new teacher–student for SM estimation, called (TS-SME), relying on teacher–student (TS) framework using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data, was proposed to estimate SM. The main advantage of this framework is to enroll a large amount of unlabeled data together with a small amount of labeled data. Experiments were carried out on two arid areas in southern Tunisia. The input data include the backscatter coefficient in two-mode polarization ( $\sigma ^{\circ }_{\textrm {VV}}$  and  $\sigma ^{\circ }_{\textrm {VH}}$ ) for Sentinel-1A, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference infrared index (NDII) for Sentinel-2A and in situ measurements. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that TS-SME framework is capable of generating a well-performed student model, with the estimation accuracy is superior to all teacher models [artificial neural network (ANN), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest regressor (RFR), and water cloud model (WCM)]. It was highly correlated with the in situ measurements with high Pearson’s correlation coefficient  $R$  ( ${R}_{\textrm {RF}} =0.86$ ,  ${R}_{\textrm {ANN}} =0.75$ ,  ${R}_{\textrm {XGBoost}} =0.77$ ,  ${R}_{\textrm {WCM}} =0.77$ ,  ${R}_{{\,\,\textrm {TS-SME}}} =0.96$ ) and low root mean square error (RMSE) ( $\textrm {RMSE}_{\textrm {RF}} =1.09$ %,  $\textrm {RMSE}_{\textrm {ANN}} =1.49$ %,  $\textrm {RMSE}_{\textrm {XGBoost}} =1.39$ %,  $\textrm {RMSE}_{\textrm {WCM}} =1.12$ %,  $\textrm {RMSE}_{\,\,\textrm {TS-SME{} }} =0.8$ %), respectively.},

  abstract={Digital twin and data-driven technologies provide an idea for realizing complex product quality prediction. Aiming at the issues of real-time visual monitoring, operating status analysis, and quality prediction in complex die-casting intelligent manufacturing, a digital twin and data-driven quality prediction architecture is proposed. The virtual-real interaction digital twin of die-casting manufacturing cells is established. The collaborative working mode of physical cells, virtual cells, and real-time monitoring is constructed to predict product quality. The learning method of die-casting parameter data and appearance defect data is proposed to realize the real-time quality prediction in die-casting process and the appearance defect quality prediction after processing, respectively. The data preprocessing and XGBoost-based learning method is proposed for real-time quality prediction of die-casting process. A single-shot refinement neural network for aluminum casting tiny defects detection (Refine-ACTDD) based on deep learning is proposed to solve the high-precision defect detection problems of small appearance defects of complex castings and large interference of complex background. Taking the complex aluminum die-casting as an example, the applications of quality prediction are verified. The method provides a new technical approach for high-precision quality prediction of complex die-casting manufacturing.},

  abstract={The use of digital twins to represent a product or process digitally is trending in many engineering disciplines. This term has also been recently introduced in the medical field. In arthroscopic surgery education, the paradigm shift from apprenticeship to simulation training has driven the need for better simulators, and the current focus is on improving simulators with respect to computational efficiency and system accuracy. However, expanding surgical simulations towards digital twins has not yet been explored. This paper introduces the digital twin concept for arthroscopic surgery, and explores its potential in light of the existing scientific literature. Thus, a systematic review was conducted to summarize and analyze the literature with respect to fast and robust design of an arthroscopic digital twin using patient-specific information, and methods for interactive surgical soft tissue simulation. The review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol with three reliable scientific search engines: IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and PubMed. Eighty papers were included in the review, and the extracted data included modeling methods, tissue types, constitutive behavior, computational efficiency or accuracy, hardware configuration, haptic device description, software tools, and system architectures. Considering the review, a novel macro-level conceptual arthroscopic digital twin system is presented, and the applicability of the review findings for the identified subsystems are discussed. The proposed system integrates patient-specific images, diagnostic data, intraoperative sensor data, and surgical practice as inputs, and conceptually enables surgical skills training, preoperative planning, and a database of virtual surgeries.},

  abstract={The segmentation of arteries in invasive coronary angiography is necessary to build quantitative models and eventually improve the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Standard segmentation algorithms suffer due to the lack of fully annotated datasets and tend to return disconnected vessels. Thus, we explore a semi-supervised segmentation framework to address these issues. Specifically, we use a student model and a teacher model as the main framework with Nested U-Nets (UNet++) as their backbones. The student model learns by minimizing a segmentation loss between the output and the ground truth, and a consistency loss guided by the uncertainty information. Additionally, a special loss function based on elastic interaction is used to improve the connectivity of arterial branches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques over 42 labeled and 60 unlabeled samples and find relative improvement of 5.59% for Dice score and 69.99% for Betti number compared to a U-Net.},

Specifically, to address the data-hungry issue, a small student model is learned with less data by distilling knowledge from a cumbersome pretrained teacher model. To interpret the teacher model and assist the learning of the student, an explainer module is introduced to highlight the regions of an input that are important for the predictions of the teacher model. Furthermore, the joint framework is trained by a principled way derived from the information-theoretic perspective.

  abstract={Multi-organ segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image processing. This paper explores a novel privacy friendly setting to train a multi-organ segmentation model, i.e., learning directly from multiple pre-trained single-organ segmentation models. We formulate it into a special unsupervised ensemble distillation problem. To solve the problem, a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework is proposed, which leverages the soft labels predicted by pre-trained teacher models to train a student model, i.e., the multi-organ segmentation model. Considering the difference of the teachers in task speciality, the pseudo labels for each organ come from the corresponding teacher, and those of the background region are from all teachers. To deal with the problem of unmatched dimensionality between the teacher models and the student model, an output transformation method is introduced. The entire learning process requires only access to pre-trained models and a reasonable set of unsupervised target data, achieving a good balance between the privacy protection and model performance. Experimental results on a widely adopted benchmark dataset have shown the promise of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks have rapidly become the mainstream method for face recognition (FR). However, this limits the deployment of such models that contain an extremely large number of parameters to embedded and low-end devices. In this work, we present an extremely lightweight and accurate FR solution, namely PocketNet. We utilize neural architecture search to develop a new family of lightweight face-specific architectures. We additionally propose a novel training paradigm based on knowledge distillation (KD), the multi-step KD, where the knowledge is distilled from the teacher model to the student model at different stages of the training maturity. We conduct a detailed ablation study proving both, the sanity of using NAS for the specific task of FR rather than general object classification, and the benefits of our proposed multi-step KD. We present an extensive experimental evaluation and comparisons with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) compact FR models on nine different benchmarks including large-scale evaluation benchmarks such as IJB-C and MegaFace. PocketNets have consistently advanced the SOTA FR performance on nine mainstream benchmarks when considering the same level of model compactness. With 0.92M parameters, our smallest network PocketNetS-128 achieved very competitive results to recent SOTA compacted models that contain up to 4M parameters.

  abstract={Music tagging is the task of predicting multiple tags of a music excerpt, and plays an important role in modern music recommendation systems. To obtain superior performance, recent approaches of music tagging focus on developing sophisticated models or exploiting additional multi-modal information. However, none of them deal with the problem of label noise during the training process despite of its ubiquitous presence. In this paper, we propose a progressive two-stage teacher-student training framework to prevent the music tagging model from overfitting label noise. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method surpasses conventional label-noise-robust methods and exhibits scalability across different tagging models. Moreover, detailed analyses demonstrate that the two teachers in the framework gradually improve student model’s generalization performance and effectively avoid the impairment from label noise.},

  abstract={We propose RemixIT, a simple and novel self-supervised training method for speech enhancement. The proposed method is based on a continuously self-training scheme that overcomes limitations from previous studies including assumptions for the in-domain noise distribution and having access to clean target signals. Specifically, a separation teacher model is pre-trained on an out-of-domain dataset and is used to infer estimated target signals for a batch of in-domain mixtures. Next, we bootstrap the mixing process by generating artificial mixtures using permuted estimated clean and noise signals. Finally, the student model is trained using the permuted estimated sources as targets while we periodically update teacher’s weights using the latest student model. Our experiments show that RemixIT outperforms several previous state-of-the-art self-supervised methods under multiple speech enhancement tasks. Additionally, RemixIT provides a seamless alternative for semi-supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation for speech enhancement tasks, while being general enough to be applied to any separation task and paired with any separation model.},

  abstract={In this work, we present a low-cost and efficient method for training a rib and clavicle fracture detection model for chest X-ray (CXR) in a semi-supervised setting where only a small portion of training data with location annotation. Our method leverages the teacher-student model paradigm which forms a consensus prediction of unknown labels using the output under different input augmentation conditions. And most importantly, we develop a dynamic sharpening method to make the pseudo label generated by the teacher model approximate to the true label with low entropy. This dynamic sharpening method adaptively adjusts the sharpening effect according to the performance of the model during the training process, which can effectively cope with the label imbalance problem in the real world, and improve the model sensitivity. The experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art fracture detection performance, i.e., an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.9767 and a free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) score of 0.9300, significantly outperforming previous approaches by a gap of 1.00% and 3.68% respectively.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation aims to learn a small student model by leveraging knowledge from a larger teacher model. The gap between these heterogeneous models hinder their knowledge transfer and it would be more challenging when the teacher model is from another task. Previous methods view the teacher model as a perfect feature extractor and train the student model to mimic it. While we notice that the teacher model has defect in extracting features of another task samples. To improve knowledge distillation under such situation, we propose Multiple Auxiliary Subspaces (MAS). Most previous methods improve distillation performance by representation alignment, while we resort to the promotion of the teacher model which is more suitable for cross-task distillation. The MAS distills the knowledge in a mutual learning way based on an auxiliary network. Along with the training procedure, the teacher model is improved by the auxiliary network which works as a trainable part of the teacher model and learn the features distribution of target samples from the student model. And this promotion of the teacher model will benefit the student model via the following distillation procedure. We adopt the representation alignment technique, multiple auxiliary networks to further enhance the proposed method. The MAS works well with limited or sufficient labeled target data. If the source data is available, based on it the MAS can construct another auxiliary network to further improve the distillation. Experiments are conducted to validate that the MAS outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on several standard benchmarks.},

  abstract={Network modeling is an essential tool for network planning and management. It allows network administrators to explore the performance of new protocols, mechanisms, or optimal configurations without the need for testing them in real production networks. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a practical solution to produce network models that can learn and extract complex patterns from real data without making any assumptions. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based network models only work with traffic matrices, this is a very coarse and simplified representation of network traffic. Although this assumption has shown to work well in certain use-cases, it is a limiting factor because, in practice, networks operate with flows. In this paper, we present FlowDT a new DL-based solution designed to model computer networks at the fine-grained flow level. In our evaluation, we show how FlowDT can accurately predict relevant per-flow performance metrics with an error of 3.5%, FlowDT’s performance is also benchmarked against vanilla DL models as well as with Queuing Theory.},

  pages={2405-2409},
  abstract={RGB-D semantic segmentation is attracting wide attention due to its better performance than conventional RGB methods. However, most of RGB-D semantic segmentation methods need to acquire the real depth information for segmenting RGB images effectively. Therefore, it is extremely challenging to take full advantage of RGB-D semantic segmentation methods for segmenting RGB images without the depth input. To address this challenge, a general depth removal distillation method is proposed to remove depth dependence from RGB-D semantic segmentation model by knowledge distillation, which can be employed to any CNN-based segmentation network structure. Specifically, a depth-aware convolution is adopted to construct the teacher network for getting sufficient knowledge from RGB-D images. Then according to the structure consistency between depth-aware convolution and general convolution, the teacher network is used to transfer the learned knowledge to the student network with general convolutions by sharing parameters. Next, the student network makes up for the lack of depth in manner of learning by RGB images. Meantime, a Variable Temperature Cross Entropy (VTCE) loss function is proposed to further increase the accuracy of the student model by soft target distillation. Extensive experiments on NYUv2 and SUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach.},

While there has been a recent growth of interest in digital twin in industry, finance, and academia, most relevant studies lack a systematic analysis of the status quo, development trends, and technological competition situations for digital twin. In this article, we used bibliometrics and patent analysis to conduct comprehensive and in-depth research of digital twin by reviewing the current status of academic research and technological development, distribution of countries and institutions, and technological competition situations. We found that academic research and technological development in digital twin are currently in the early stages of rapid growth, which is radiating from applications in smart manufacturing to other scenarios such as medical and health, smart cities, energy, transportation, public emergency, and agricultural food. Artificial intelligence technology, digital twin integrated architecture and system, intelligent real-time control have gradually become the key topics of academic research and technology research and development in the field of digital twin in recent years. The digital framework, sustainable digital twin, deep learning and neural network algorithms, and full lifecycle management have the potential to become technology development trends.

  abstract={Neural end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) is superior to conventional statistical methods in many ways. However, the exposure bias problem, that arises from the mismatch between the training and inference process in autoregressive models, remains an issue. It often leads to performance degradation in face of out-of-domain test data. To address this problem, we study a novel decoding knowledge transfer strategy, and propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation (MT-KD) network for Tacotron2 TTS model. The idea is to pre-train two Tacotron2 TTS teacher models in teacher forcing and scheduled sampling modes, and transfer the pre-trained knowledge to a student model that performs free running decoding. We show that the MT-KD network provides an adequate platform for neural TTS training, where the student model learns to emulate the behaviors of the two teachers, at the same time, minimizing the mismatch between training and run-time inference. Experiments on both Chinese and English data show that MT-KD system consistently outperforms the competitive baselines in terms of naturalness, robustness and expressiveness for in-domain and out-of-domain test data. Furthermore, we show that knowledge distillation outperforms adversarial learning and data augmentation in addressing the exposure bias problem.},

Recent studies discuss the possibility of using digital twins for intrusion detection in industrial systems. Accordingly, this study contributes to a digital twin-based security framework for industrial control systems, extending its capabilities for simulation of attacks and defense mechanisms. Four types of process-aware attack scenarios are implemented on a standalone open-source digital twin of an industrial filling plant: command injection, network Denial of Service (DoS), calculated measurement modification, and naive measurement modification. A stacked ensemble classifier is proposed as the real-time intrusion detection, based on the offline evaluation of eight supervised machine learning algorithms. The designed stacked model outperforms previous methods in terms of F1Score and accuracy, by combining the predictions of various algorithms, while it can detect and classify intrusions in near real-time (0.1 seconds). This study also discusses the practicality and benefits of the proposed digital twin-based security framework.},

  abstract={Most of the existing works on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications assume some deterministic or stochastic channel models, which is unrealistic for highly-dynamic vehicular channels in urban environments under the influence of high-speed vehicle motion, intermittent connectivity, and signal attenuation in urban canyon. Enabled by the concept of digital twin, the digital replica of a real-world physical system, this paper proposes a city-model-aware deep learning algorithm for dynamic channel estimation in urban vehicular environments. Specifically, the digital twin simulation allows us to accurately model radio ray reflection and attenuation in urban canyon, and the data can be supplemented and validated with empirical measurements. Our results indicates that the city-model-aware deep neural network (CMA DNN) estimator performs much better than conventional methods and has more than 32% improvement in BER when compared with generic DNN approaches that do not take the 3D city model into account. Since some geometry-based models like ray-tracing techniques used in the digital twin simulation for dynamic channel modeling could be computational expensive, we also propose a basis expansion model (BEM) approach to simplify the computation load of the overall methodology to gain a good balance between accuracy and timeliness.},

  abstract={This paper introduces the idea of implementing digital twin for predictive maintenance under open system architecture. Predictive maintenance (PdM) is critical to machines operating under complex working conditions to prevent major and unexpected machine failures and production downtime. A cost and reliability optimized predictive maintenance framework for industry 4.0 machines key parts based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of monitoring data is proposed. Employing machine learning and advanced analytics for data fusion for PdM promises for accurate failure diagnostics and prognostics in addition to optimized maintenance decisions. Furthermore, a cost effective maintenance framework can be implemented under reliability centered maintenance strategy. The qualitative and quantitative analysis will help the decision-making process that leads to accurate predictive maintenance strategies. The proposed method is expected to provide cost-effective maintenance and improved intelligence of the predictive process and the accuracy of predictive results.},

  abstract={The solution of inverse scattering (IS) problems supported by artificial intelligence (AI) is addressed. An innovative solution strategy based on the System-by-Design (SbD) paradigm is proposed for the computationally-efficient exploitation of a global optimization strategy for minimizing the data mismatch cost function. Towards this end, a suitable selection, customization, and interconnection of SbD functional blocks is adopted. Moreover, the computationally-unaffordable repeated evaluation of each trial solution during the optimization is bypassed thanks to the exploitation of a digital twin (DT) based on the learning-by-examples (LBE) paradigm. An illustrative numerical example is shown to prove the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed solution strategy when dealing with 2D free-space microwave imaging (MI) scenarios.},

  abstract={This paper presents online simulation along with physical environments employing digital twins to develop robotic and computer vision applications, such as bin picking, by providing a virtual testing environment with real conditions for robotic systems and their surroundings. Particularly for situations such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, this approach permits the integration of knowledge and practice remotely without having the need of requiring a physical robot, increasing equity and inclusivity in the assessment, by reducing the gap between students from different institutions due to the lack of resources to buy the required robotic devices and even enabling remote connection to the classrooms. The proposed task can be performed as long as the educational center counts with basic computer equipment and internet connection. This paper presents a bin picker application based on mono and stereo vision to make the classification of cylinders of different colors and sizes and their arrangement in a base by using image processing and depth estimation algorithms. The performance of the classification was measured in terms of the error in millimeters from the difference of the desired and the obtained position. The images used for classification were taken in real life considering the environment conditions, and a digital twin of the bin picker and objects was made. The image classification and the overall instructions that the robot performed were generated on MATLAB, where the data from the real environment captured by cameras was sent. From here, the instructions were sent to URsim, which serves as the robot controller, and the final virtual simulation with the models of the base and cylinders was performed on Kuka-Sim Pro. This approach can then be utilized to implement different assessments based on personal results from simulation activities. As this assessment requires specialized knowledge regarding robotics, computer vision and classification algorithms, this methodology is intended to be applied for university students, at the level that is adequate according to the educational programs of each university.},

This closure deteriorated the level of all learners and resulted in a considerable disturbance of the education system. In this context, distance learning was the best solution. This paper reports the findings obtained Likert scale survey on April 2020 sent to learners and teachers of the Tunisian universities. In this survey, the interviewees were asked about their opinions concerning e-learning in the new situation resulting from covid19 crisis. After describing the existing learner models, we present the findings provided by examining the impact of the learning situation on the learner model. Learners and teachers were asked to capture four profile dimensions: interaction, involvement, motivation and emotions during the COVID -19 health crisis. The analysis of the obtained results show that a new learning situation influences negatively the learner model, which proves the importance of considering the situational dimension in such a learner model.},

  abstract={This article proposes a method to remotely control the robot in the laboratory through the Kinect camera to solve the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic on the laboratory teaching experience which allows users to remotely control robots through their own body movements to understand the principles of robots. It is used to solve the problem of fewer students willing to participate in robot remote education. In this study, the Azure Kinect DK camera was used to collect the motion posture of the upper limbs of the human body. The Kinect camera calculates the frames of human arm joints’ motion. The control system calculates the direction of motion of each joint of the human body based on the quaternion by mapping the heterogeneous human joints with the robot joints. Make the posture of the human arm swing correspond to the posture of the robot’s movement. Thus, the robot in the laboratory can be driven remotely through Azure Kinect DK. By using the method described in this article, students use the camera’s motion capture system to remotely manipulate the robot to grab some simple objects. Through the method described in this research, students can carry out some simple operations on the robots in the laboratory from remote. So it is convenient for students to understand the basic principles of robots and achieve the purpose of better remote experimental teaching. At the same time, students can get practical application of motor servo control, ergonomics, physical simulation engine, digital twin system, etc.},

Our approach employs a digital twin of the environment to create an accurate map-based channel model and train a beam predictor that narrows the beam search space to a set of candidate configurations. To verify the proposed concept, we perform shooting-and-bouncing ray modeling for a reconstructed 3D model of an industrial vehicle calibrated using the real-world millimeter-wave propagation data collected during a measurement campaign. We confirm that lightweight ML models are capable of predicting the optimal beam configuration while enjoying a considerably smaller size compared to the map-based channel model.},

  abstract={The wide use of unmanned aerial vehicles provides a promising paradigm for improving air-ground services and applications (e.g., urban sensing, disaster relief) in air-ground integrated networks (AGINs). Digital twin (DT), which is an emerging technology that utilizes data, models, and intelligent algorithms to integrate cyber physical networks and digital virtual models, provides a real-time and dynamic simulation platform for strategy optimization and decision making in AGINs. Due to the openness and massive connectivity of AGINs, the security and reliability services in this system become an important issue. In this article, we investigate the DT envisioned secure federated aerial learning for AGINs via an aerial blockchain approach. Specifically, we propose a layered framework of DT envisioned AGINs, which comprises the construction segment, communication segment, aggregation segment, analysis segment, and operation segment. Based on this framework, we offer the applications of the proposed DT envisioned AGINs. To guarantee the security of data transmission in AGINs, we investigate the aerial blockchain-based approach for ensuring data security. Furthermore, we provide a case study of DT envisioned secure federated aerial computing in AGINs to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through designing the aerial blockchain and training model.},

  abstract={A digital twin has recently received considerable attention in various industry domains. The digital twin replicates physical objects (e.g., people, objects, spaces, systems, and processes) in the real world into digital objects in the digital world. It also provides various simulations to solve problems in the real world or to improve situational operations. Therefore, the digital twin is a convergence of various technologies, such as advanced machine-learning algorithms, data analytics, super-resolution visualization and modeling, and simulation. Because the digital twin is a complicated technology, a step-by-step implementation that includes many technology elements should be considered to create a digital twin model. In this study, implementation layers are introduced to guide practical implementations of the digital twin. In addition, technology elements were suggested for the presented implementation layers. Because the suggested technology elements include clear technology definitions, various application domains (e.g., energy, transportation, logistics, environment, manufacturing, and smart cities) can easily utilize the introduced implementation layers and technology elements according to the intended purpose. Furthermore, this paper describes the evolution of digital twins. Digital twin technology has evolved continuously since 2002, when the digital twin concept was first introduced. In the described evolution levels, we show the future aspects of digital twin technology, according to the technological evolution direction. Therefore, the digital twin model can be efficiently created by considering the evolution direction and future aspects by using the suggested digital twin evolution levels.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Inference Enterprise Modeling (IEM) is a methodology developed to address test and evaluation limitations that insider threat detection enterprises face due to a lack of ground truth and/or missing data. IEM uses a collection of statistical, data processing, analysis, and machine learning techniques to estimate and forecast the performance of these enterprises. As part of developing the IEM method, models satisfying various detection system evaluation requirements were created. In this work, we extend IEM as a digital twin generation technique by representing modeled processes as executable UML Activity Diagrams and tracing solution processes to problem requirements using ontologies. Using the proposed framework, we can rapidly prototype a digital twin of a detection system that can also be imported and executed in systems engineering simulation software tools such as Cameo Enterprise Architecture Simulation Toolkit. Cyber security and threat detection is a continuous process that requires regular maintenance and testing throughout its lifecycle, but there often exists access issues for sensitive and private data and proprietary detection model details to perform adequate test and evaluation activities in the live production environment. To solve this issue, organizations can use a digital twin technique to create a real-time virtual counterpart of the physical system. We describe a method for creating digital twins of live and/or hypothetical insider threat detection enterprises for the purpose of performing test and evaluation activities on continuous monitoring systems that are sensitive to disruptions. In this work, we use UML Activity Diagrams to leverage the integrated simulation capabilities of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE).},

  year={2022},
  volume={71},
  number={},
  pages={1-13},
  abstract={We propose a simple yet effective approach, called joint guided learning (JGL), based on knowledge distillation for image classification. Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. The teacher model utilizes both correct and incorrect predictive labels to guide the optimization of the student model. However, the incorrect predictive labels have a negative influence on the student model. Moreover, it is not enough to rely solely on predictive labels to transfer knowledge. The student model should make full use of the features of the teacher model. To mitigate these issues, we design a JGL approach that exploits the joint guidance of features and the predictive labels. Our method involves two novel components: 1) a guided label refinery module that considers the correct predictions and ignores the incorrect predictions and 2) a channel distillation (CD) module that guides the student model to learn the attention map of each channel from feature maps in the teacher model. Experimental results show that our approach can achieve 82.18%, 66.08%, 88.36%, and 90.14% accuracy on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and Stanford Dogs, respectively. In addition, the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on four image classification datasets. Ablation studies further show the contributions of different components in our method.},

  abstract={A digital-twin (DT)-enabled Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) system for telemedical simulation is developed, systematically integrated with mixed reality (MR), 5G cloud computing, and a generative adversarial network (GAN) to achieve remote lung cancer implementation. Patient-specific data from 90 lung cancer with pulmonary embolism (PE)-positive patients, with 1372 lung cancer control groups, were gathered from Qujing and Dehong, and then transmitted and preprocessed using 5G. A novel robust auxiliary classifier GAN (rAC-GAN)-based intelligent network is employed to facilitate lung cancer with the PE prediction model. To improve the accuracy and immersion during remote surgical implementation, a real-time operating room perspective from the perception layer with a surgical navigation image is projected to the surgeon’s helmet in the application layer using the DT-based MR guide clue with 5G. The accuracies of the area under the curve (AUC) of our new intelligent IoMT system were 0.92 and 0.93. Furthermore, the pathogenic features learned from our rAC-GAN model are highly consistent with the statistical epidemiological results. The proposed intelligent IoMT system generates significant performance improvement to process substantial clinical data at cloud centers and shows a novel framework for remote medical data transfer and deep learning analytics for DT-based surgical implementation.},

In particular, it has become a key tool for developing data-driven models for emerging digital twin development which demands the living models for simulating system behaviors. However, such data-driven models carry a fatal deficiency: once the operational environments changed, the model may hardly work well or even becomes useless. This paper attempts to address this issue by proposing to apply transfer learning techniques to develop lifetime robust models for real-world applications. After laying out problems and the reasons of model performance degradation, this paper presents a framework for developing lifetime predictive models for digital twin.

  abstract={Realizing Service Function Chaining with a micro-service-based architecture results in an increased number of computationally cheap Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Pinning cheap VNFs to dedicated CPU cores can waste resources since not every VNF fully utilizes its core. Thus, cheap VNFs should share CPU cores to improve resource utilization. However, sharing cores can result in degraded performance due to interference between VNFs, even in mildly loaded scenarios. We propose D2A, a system that combines Neural Combinatorial Optimization, Machine Learning (ML)-based Digital Twins (DTs), and Game Theory to optimize VNF assignments. Measurements in a testbed show that D2A increases throughput by up to 46% and reduces latency by up to 93%, compared to three baseline algorithms. Using an ML-based DT to model VNF interference increases throughput by up to 11%, and reduces latency by up to 90% compared to an analytical model of the system.},

  year={2022},
  volume={60},
  number={},
  pages={1-12},
  abstract={Remote sensing data distribution generally exposes the long-tailed characteristic. This will limit the object recognition performance of existing deep models when they are trained with such unbalanced data. In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical distillation framework (HDF) to address the long-tailed object recognition in aerial images. First, we notice that not only student model should learn feature representations from teachers but also teacher models should learn feature representations from each other. Therefore, we build hierarchical teacher-wise distillation (HTWD) to improve the feature representations of the teacher models trained with middle and tail data, which is achieved by distilling the feature representations of the teacher model trained with head data. Second, we notice that the feature representations of the middle and tail classes cannot be effectively distilled from the teacher to the student since too little middle and tail data can be used to learn. Thus, we propose self-calibrated sampling (SCS) learning that enforces the student to strengthen the learning of the middle and tail data, thereby improving the student’ feature learning ability. Extensive experiments on two widely used DOTA and FGSC-23 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, the 5G converged shipbuilding network based on digital twin is studied, and an efficient and reliable method for multi-mode terminal access and multi-QoS management is proposed. This method continuously constructs the communication environment of digital-twin network through data collection from the physical network, and performs detailed network simulation and mapping through RL (Reinforcement Learning) in digital-twin network to achieve scheduling optimization. The decisions made in digital-twin network are delivered to the physical network to achieve efficient and reliable multi-mode terminal access and multi-QoS management. The simulation results show that the proposed new architecture and method effectively can improve the efficiency of 5G converged network in the shipyard.},

  abstract={Over the past decades industrial communication networks have evolved into highly diverse and heterogeneous environments, with a variety of different technologies being deployed to address the diverse requirements of manufacturing-and automation-specific use cases. These include stringent latency limits, high availability and reliability, as well as deterministic communication behavior. To assure the necessary allocation of re-sources and provisioning of required Quality-of-Service in highly diverse communication systems, a holistic network management approach is needed that can serve all cornerstones of modern industrial networks. More recently, this lead to the development of new adaptive and agile management approaches that imple-ment autonomous and self-organizing manufacturing networks, whereby Machine Learning (ML) methods started to become an integral part for overcoming the limiting factors of practically deploying such systems. Due to the growing complexity of today's networking environments, defining network management policies based on expert knowledge becomes increasingly difficult. ML has evolved as a promising technique to extract knowledge from collected data to enable cognitive network management approaches. This paper reviews past advances in ML applications for zero touch management of heterogeneous industrial communication networks. It illustrates how a network's management life-cycle that is based on digital twin technology can harnesses the potentials of ML to bring the concepts of organic computing and zero-touch cognitive manufacturing within industrial networks closer to reality. Lastly, recent papers that discuss the use of ML approaches for self-x features in Zero-Touch Management (ZTM) network environments are surveyed and relevant open issues are discussed.},

  abstract={Images captured in clinic such as MRI scans are usually in 3D formats with high spatial resolutions. Existing learning-based models for medical image registration consume large GPU memories and long inference time, which is difficult to be deployed in resource-limited diagnosis scenarios. To address this problem, instead of shrinking the model size as in previous works, we turn to reducing the input resolution of existing registration models and boosting their performance through knowledge distillation. Specifically, we propose a cross-resolution distillation (CRD) scheme, which is designed to train low-resolution models under the guidance of corresponding high-resolution models. Nevertheless, due to the resolution gap between features in high/low-resolution models, straightforward distillation is difficult to apply. To overcome this challenge, we first introduce a feature-shifted teacher (FST) to shift and fuse features of high/low-resolution models. Then, we exploit this teacher model to guide the learning of the low-resolution student model with distillation losses on both features and deformation fields. Finally, we only need to use the distilled student model during inference. Experimental results on four 3D medical image datasets demonstrate that the low-resolution models trained through our CRD scheme use fewer than 20% GPU memories and less than 20% inference time while achieving competitive performance compared with corresponding high-resolution models.},

  abstract={Digital twinning approaches for high-value propulsion system assets is a growing trend, currently seen in renewables, marine and aviation markets. The benefits of this approach, involving "living-learning" models for diagnostic, prognostic and system optimizations are suggested in literature as many. When deploying such an approach, there are many discussions and decisions around modelling techniques to deploy, and the required fidelity of such models. It can be assumed though that the greater the potential to gain real measurement data, the greater the opportunity to improve the overall system model accuracy.This paper develops a model of a previously overlooked but essential part of the engine control system - the measuring chain relating to the closed-loop engine combustion controller. This part of the system performs an essential role to provide real-time data for the engine control loop, to be able to optimize the engine performance on a cylinder-by-cylinder, cycle-by-cycle basis. However, failure of this part of the system can often be impossible to distinguish from an engine fault when there is no knowledge of the system health of the measuring chain. Therefore, performance monitoring of this sub-system is of high value to the end-user, to fully optimize and potentially decarbonize their engine system, in combination with digital twin methods.},

  abstract={There is a growing interest in developing and implementing adaptive instructional systems to improve, automate, and personalize student education. A necessary part of any such adaptive instructional system is a student model used to predict or analyze learner behavior and inform adaptation. To help inform researchers in this area, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review of 11 years of research (2010-2021) in student modeling, focusing on learner characteristics, learning indicators, and foundational aspects of dissimilar models. We mainly emphasize increased prediction accuracy when using multidimensional learner data to create multimodal models in real-world adaptive instructional systems. In addition, we discuss challenges inherent in real-world multimodal modeling, such as uncontrolled data collection environments leading to noisy data and data sync issues. Finally, we reinforce our findings and conclusions through an industry case study of an adaptive instructional system. In our study, we verify that adding multiple data modalities increases our model prediction accuracy from 53.3% to 69%. At the same time, the challenges encountered with our real-world case study, including uncontrolled data collection environment with inevitably noisy data, calls for synchronization and noise control strategies for data quality and usability.},

  abstract={Industry 4.0 is concerned with how the global production and supply network operates through the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing systems which depends on closed-loop control system components. These components are prone to faults, especially in sensors. so, a fault-tolerant control framework is needed to deal with these kinds of faults. Many researchers work on developing more intelligence data driven fault-tolerant control techniques instead of traditional ones which need a complete sophisticated model. This paper proposes a learning fault tolerant control of discrete event systems subjected to sensors faults, based on recurrent neural networks. The proposed network has both previous and current sensors signals as inputs and current actuators signals as outputs. The new data driven fault tolerant control replaces the diagnosis and control reconfiguration block function in the traditional one. A case study that integrates automated pneumatic material handling is used to demonstrate the proposed approach. Factory I/O simulator is integrated with MATLAB based on the digital twin concept to simulate and verify the proposed approach. Results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of handling sensors faults in faultless and various faulty scenarios.},

  abstract={The success of pre-trained language representation models such as BERT benefits from their “overparameterized” nature, resulting in training time consuming, high computational complexity and superior requirement of devices. Among the variety of model compression and acceleration techniques, Knowledge Distillation(KD) has attracted extensive attention for compressing pre-trained language models. However, the major two challenges for KD are: (i)Transfer more knowledge from the teacher model to student model without scarifying accuracy while accelerating. (ii)Higher training speed of the lightweight model is accompanied by the risk of overfitting due to the noise influence. To address these problems, we propose a novel model based on knowledge distillation, called Theseus-BERT Guided Distill CNN(TBG-disCNN). BERT-of-Theseus [1] is employed as the teacher model and CNN as the student model. Aiming at the inherent noise problem, we propose coordinated CNN-BiLSTM as a parameter-sharing layer for Multi-Task Learning (MTL), in order to capture both regional and long-term dependence information. Our approach has approximately good performance as BERT-base and teacher model with $12 \times$ and $281 \times$ speedup of inference and $19.58 \times$ and $8.94 \times$ fewer parameters usage, respectively.},

Network operators can leverage the DTN to perform different optimization tasks (e.g., Traffic Engineering, Network Planning).Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) showed a high performance when applied to solve network optimization problems. In the context of DTN, DRL can be leveraged to solve optimization problems without directly impacting the real-world network behavior. However, DRL scales poorly with the problem size and complexity. In this paper, we explore the use of Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to train DRL agents for solving a routing optimization problem. The experimental results show that ES achieved a training time speed-up of 128 and 6 for the NSFNET and GEANT2 topologies respectively.},

  abstract={This article proposes EduTalk, an out-of-the-box Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart learning environment for programming education. In particular, EduTalk enables the students to write VPython programs that render 3-D animations in the browser without installing extra software or using any specific (and typically expensive) hardware. EduTalk takes the user’s smartphone as a controller for cyber–physical interaction, which nicely integrates with learning of other core courses such as physics and mathematics. EduTalk allows building science exhibition projects by writing VPython programs to show 3-D animation, where the cost for EduTalk’s cyber–physical interaction is low and is almost maintenance free. The major contribution of this article is the IoT-based EduTalk proposal that subtly utilizes an IoT platform IoTtalk to conveniently generate cyber–physical interaction for learning how to program as well as learning core courses such as physics. The programming exercises can be easily extended to science exhibition projects and then the development of digital twin applications. A mechanism is provided to easily integrate GlowScript animation demos with EduTalk, which significantly simplifies the effort for teachers to prepare the lecturers. Finally, we show how data collected from EduTalk can be analyzed to improve learning design for cyber–physical interactive animation.},

We aim at minimizing the energy consumption of the entire MEC system by jointly optimizing mobile terminal users (MTUs) association, UAV trajectory, transmission power distribution and computation capacity allocation while respecting the constraints of mission maximum processing delays. Specifically, double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm stemming from deep reinforcement learning is first proposed to effectively solve the problem of MTUs association and UAV trajectory. Then, the closed-form expression is employed to handle the problem of transmission power distribution and the computation capacity allocation problem is further addressed via an iterative algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme is able to converge and significantly reduce the total energy consumption of the MEC system compared to the benchmark schemes.},

  abstract={Robust detection of moving vehicles is a critical task for any autonomously operating outdoor robot or self-driving vehicle. Most modern approaches for solving this task rely on training image-based detectors using large-scale vehicle detection datasets such as nuScenes or the Waymo Open Dataset. Providing manual annotations is an expensive and laborious exercise that does not scale well in practice. To tackle this problem, we propose a self-supervised approach that leverages audio-visual cues to detect moving vehicles in videos. Our approach employs contrastive learning for localizing vehicles in images from corresponding pairs of images and recorded audio. In extensive experiments carried out with a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our approach provides accurate detections of moving vehicles and does not require manual annotations. We furthermore show that our model can be used as a teacher to supervise an audio-only detection model. This student model is invariant to illumination changes and thus effectively bridges the domain gap inherent to models leveraging exclusively vision as the predominant modality.},

  abstract={This paper studies a 6G use case for connecting users in emergency. A fast-forming network with a resource-limited aerial base station (BS) connecting with scattered communities of users is considered. Properly connecting each individual user in the service area is achieved by 1) applying device-to-device (D2D) communication within each community, 2) fairly assigning limited number of channels, and 3) optimally placing the flying BS. Q-learning, a common type of reinforcement learning (RL), is employed for autonomous BS placement. Two optimization objectives for BS placement are considered to maximize the per-user data rate in the worse condition and minimize the total BS transmitted power, respectively. To overcome resource limitations of the aerial BS, the RL training with many iterations is a done in the digital twin (DT) virtual space connected to the physical space via an aerial BS enabled by 6G technology. It is shown that, even the models used in DT is imperfect, nearly-optimal results can be obtained in DT. In particular, compared to RL training 100% in the physical space, a huge number of BS moves can be avoided and significant among of time and energy can be saved.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1856-1868},
  abstract={Transfer learning is a popular software reuse technique in the deep learning community that enables developers to build custom mod-els (students) based on sophisticated pretrained models (teachers). However, like vulnerability inheritance in traditional software reuse, some defects in the teacher model may also be inherited by students, such as well-known adversarial vulnerabilities and backdoors. Re-ducing such defects is challenging since the student is unaware of how the teacher is trained and/or attacked. In this paper, we propose ReMoS, a relevant model slicing technique to reduce defect inheri-tance during transfer learning while retaining useful knowledge from the teacher model. Specifically, ReMoS computes a model slice (a subset of model weights) that is relevant to the student task based on the neuron coverage information obtained by profiling the teacher model on the student task. Only the relevant slice is used to fine-tune the student model, while the irrelevant weights are retrained from scratch to minimize the risk of inheriting defects. Our experi-ments on seven DNN defects, four DNN models, and eight datasets demonstrate that ReMoS can reduce inherited defects effectively (by 63% to 86% for CV tasks and by 40% to 61 % for NLP tasks) and efficiently with minimal sacrifice of accuracy (3% on average).},

  abstract={In this study, a Concept Question Answering system applied to the Computer Domain (CQACD) for intelligent tutoring is proposed. This system is a dialogue-based Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that allows the tutor and student with mixed-initiative and natural language to ask each other questions concerning the basic computer knowledge in the Computer Basics course. CQACD is based on constructivist principles and encourages the learner to construct knowledge rather than merely receiving knowledge, which has the following characteristics: (a) this system employs a domain ontology with rich semantic relationships to model the basic computer knowledge and build up a concept-centric knowledge model, (b) uses a limited number of 80 input templates with description logics to acquire the intention of questions posed by students, (c) a textual entailment algorithm with semantic technologies is proposed to match the input template and assess the student’s contribution to improve the flexibility of the system, and (d) an ontology-driven dialogue management mechanism is proposed, which can quickly form the conversational content and conversational sequence. The experimental results show that CQACD can replace the teachers’ tutoring in large classes and can promote the learning of poor students in large classes better than teachers can. The paper reveals that the domain ontology with rich semantic relationships plays an important role in the Concept Question Answer System (CQAS). It can model CQAS’s discipline knowledge, provide structured domain knowledge for student model, template design and matching, and provide basic architectural architecture for dialogue management.},

  abstract={Peer assessment is a valuable educational activity, which promotes learner engagement and critical thinking, while also decreasing the time spent by the teachers on evaluating students’ work. Over the past decades, several platforms have been proposed to support the peer assessment process. The current landscape is dominated by special-purpose, context-specific peer evaluation systems, which were designed to support a particular type of learning activity, artifact, or discipline. In this article, we propose an alternative, a generic and comprehensive peer assessment platform, called LearnEval, which is very flexible and able to accommodate a variety of pedagogical scenarios. Distinctive functionalities include: highly configurable peer assessment workflow, several automatic and manual review allocation mechanisms, initial calibration/training options for the students, complex dashboard with statistics, scores and graphical visualizations, as well as an extensive open learner model. The platform was developed in an iterative manner, with several extensions and improvements informed by the findings of the initial pilot studies. The article also reports on a practical application of LearnEval in a project-based learning scenario, with very promising results; multiple perspectives of the peer assessment process are analyzed: student behavior, peer grades validity, and perceived learning experience. Comparative results with an earlier study show increased levels of system usability, grading validity, and student satisfaction.},

  abstract={The reliability calculation is an important step in the system analysis to determine the remaining service life of the industrial automation system’s components operating in changing environments. In contrast to classic automation systems working without considering dynamic environment parameters, for an accurate calculation, it is not adequate to use only the information obtained from product specifications or experiments. Rather, this calculation should be done dynamically. For this reason, we used the Markov model as the reliability calculation method, since it is a powerful state-based analytical technique considering the dynamic aspects concerning testing and maintenance. This is the need to add dynamism to the system. This paper proposes a novel approach using the concept of intelligent Digital Twin (iDT) for the dynamic calculation of the reliability of industrial automation systems. Moreover, we evaluate our concept as a prototype. Our developed concept is a comprehensive approximation of the calculation of reliability in an industrial automation system by considering dynamic influencing factor failure rate, human factor failure rate, manufacturer failure rate, and repair rate.},

Most of the algorithms have been evaluated based on multiple criteria and hyper parameter tuning. The analysis of the results was done in a comparative way, multiple regression evaluation metrics being considered. The experiments have shown that the extreme gradient boosting algorithm provides the best results in terms of performance, but with timing and resource allocation drawbacks. On the other hand, a simple decision tree model seems to give good results if a tradeoff between performance and prediction time must be made. The  $k$ -nearest neighbors algorithm is also performing pretty well, especially because we are experimenting in a static environment.},

A preliminary user study confirms that a DT of a heat pump is an attractive option as a VR learning environment for training maintenance procedures and tasks due to the positive learning and user experience. However, a few participants would prefer using a real system in the learning of maintenance tasks as compared to the DT. The ratings of perceived immersiveness measured as the concentration on the tasks, rather than on using the system indicate that there is room for improvement. Realism and immersiveness of carrying out tasks and actions in VR could be improved by implementing more realistic haptics as well as more freedom to carry out the maintenance procedures in a user selected order after first learning the correct order.},

  abstract={Covid-19 has been an alarming bifurcation in the last three years. Education and learning are among the areas most affected. Online learning environments are not a choice or a model for learning modernization, but it is an obligation and a unique solution to ensure educational continuity. This has led to a growing interest in MOOCs, which reveals the importance of taking into account some appropriate information to ensure learner-centered learning to overcome the requirements of the massiveness of learners and their scattering in front of the numerous services of MOOCs. Following this direction, we propose a deep study of different approaches to personalize MOOCs. Our study aims to consider affective information as one of the main personalization parameters in the learner model, to guarantee a high-quality education with a high recommendation accuracy.},

  abstract={This brief proposed a Multi-Channel Multi-Domain (MCMD) based knowledge distillation algorithm for sleep staging using single-channel EEG. Both knowledge from different domains and different channels are learnt in the proposed algorithm, simultaneously. A multi-channel pre-training and single-channel fine-tuning scheme is used in the proposed work. The knowledge from different channels in the source domain is transferred to the single-channel model in the target domain. A pre-trained teacher-student model scheme is used to distill knowledge from the multi-channel teacher model to the single-channel student model combining with output transfer and intermediate feature transfer in the target domain. The proposed algorithm achieves a state-of-the-art single-channel sleep staging accuracy of 86.5%, with only 0.6% deterioration from the state-of-the-art multi-channel model. There is an improvement of 2% compared to the baseline model. The experimental results show that knowledge from multiple domains (different datasets) and multiple channels (e.g., EMG, EOG) could be transferred to single-channel sleep staging.},

  abstract={Existing skeleton-based action recognition methods require heavy computational resources for accurate predictions. One promising technique to obtain an accurate yet lightweight action recognition network is knowledge distillation (KD), which distills the knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model. However, existing distillation works in action recognition require a pre-trained teacher network and a two-stage learning procedure. In this work, we propose a novel Online Knowledge Distillation framework by distilling Action Recognition structure knowledge in a one-stage manner to improve the distillation efficiency, termed OKDAR. Specifically, OKDAR learns a single multi-branch network and acquires the predictions from each one, which is then assembled by a feature mix model as the implicit teacher network to teach each student in reverse. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by extensive experiments on two common benchmarks, i.e., NTU-RGB+D 60 and NTU-RGB+D 120.},
