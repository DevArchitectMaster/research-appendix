  abstract={This paper describes a method for distilling a recurrent-based sequence-to-sequence (S2S) voice conversion (VC) model. Although the performance of recent VCs is becoming higher quality, streaming conversion is still a challenge when considering practical applications. To achieve streaming VC, the conversion model needs a streamable structure, a causal layer rather than a non-causal layer. Motivated by this constraint and recent advances in S2S learning, we apply the teacher-student framework to recurrent-based S2S- VC models. A major challenge is how to minimize degradation due to the use of causal layers which masks future input information. Experimental evaluations show that except for male-to-female speaker conversion, our approach is able to maintain the teacher model's performance in terms of subjective evaluations despite the streamable student model structure.

  abstract={Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) have the potential to become providers of frequency regulation services in future energy systems. In this case, the reliable operation of BESS has a significant impact on system stability. One of the tools that ensures the secure BESS operation is applying a digital twin to forecast the BESS state of charge (SOC). It allows to predict BESS behavior and identify potential failures or cyberattacks in BESS. In this article, we compare multiple data-driven approaches to forecast the SOC of a BESS based on realistic dataset and real battery operation. Recurrent neural networks, e.g., feedforward neural network, gated recurrent unit, long short-term memory, support vector regression, random forest, and AdaBoost methods are applied to evaluate each method's performance. We compare the methods based on the maximum and average forecast errors, the required computational capacity, as well as expected training speed. To validate the results, in addition to the data gathered from simulations, we used experimental setup with a BESS of 79 kWh providing containment reserve for normal operation, which is a BESS service with a high economical potential in Nordic Region. Furthermore, we provide recommendations for the methods that are suitable to be applied for modeling the digital twin of a utility-scale battery digital twin.},

  abstract={With recent advances in information and communication technology (ICT), the bleeding edge concept of digital twin (DT) has enticed the attention of many researchers to revolutionize the entire modern industries. DT concept refers to a digital representation of a physical entity that is able to reflect its physical behavior by applying platforms and bidirectional interaction of data in real-time. The remarkable deployment of the internet of things in the power grid has led to reliable access to information that improves its performance and equips it with a powerful tool for real-time data management and analysis. This paper aims to trace the continuous investigation and propose practical ideas in originating and developing DT technology, according to various application domains of power systems, and also describes the proposed solutions to deal with the challenges associated with DT. Indeed, with the development of modern cities, different energy layers such as transportation systems, smart grids, and microgrids have emerged facing various issues that challenge the multi-dimensional energy management system. For example, in transportation systems, traffic is a major problem that requires real-time management, planning, and analysis. In power grids, remote data transfer within the grid and also various analyzes needing real data are just some of the current challenges in the field. These problems can be cracked by providing and analyzing a real twin framework in each section. All in all, this paper aims to survey different applications of DT in the development of the various aspects of energy management within a city including transportation systems, power grids, and microgrids. Besides, the security of DT technology based on ML is discussed. It also provides a complete view for the readers to be able to develop and deploy a DT technology for various power system applications.},

  pages={10811-10820},
  abstract={The industrial visual sensing-actuation system is an implementation approach to construct the loop between the digital twin and physical systems, which is facing the following challenges. First, the cross-digital-physical information exchanges bring a high end-to-end delay that threatens the functional safety of industrial systems. Second, industrial scenarios are diverse, such as manufacturing, chemical engineering, etc., which makes the intelligent sensing strategies for one scenario inapplicable to others, especially for few-shot cases. Third, intelligent actuation strategies cannot allocate resources across digital and physical domains. We propose the delay-minimization-based intelligent digital twin approach to address the above challenges. The digital twin framework incorporates samples from the physical domain to train the learning models in the digital domain. The proposed scheme tailors and adapts transferable and reinforced learning models with end-to-end delay analysis to optimize the training process. The feasibility and efficiency of the scheme are validated by simulations.},

  pages={6254-6263},
  abstract={We consider a new problem of few-shot learning of com-pact models. Meta-learning is a popular approach for few-shot learning. Previous work in meta-learning typically assumes that the model architecture during meta-training is the same as the model architecture used for final deployment. In this paper, we challenge this basic assumption. For final deployment, we often need the model to be small. But small models usually do not have enough capacity to effectively adapt to new tasks. In the mean time, we often have access to the large dataset and extensive computing power during meta-training since meta-training is typically per-formed on a server. In this paper, we propose task-specific meta distillation that simultaneously learns two models in meta-learning: a large teacher model and a small student model. These two models are jointly learned during meta-training. Given a new task during meta-testing, the teacher model is first adapted to this task, then the adapted teacher model is used to guide the adaptation of the student model. The adapted student model is used for final deployment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in few-shot image classification using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). Our proposed method outperforms other alternatives on several benchmark datasets.},

  pages={2818-2827},
  abstract={Rapid dissemination of misinformation is a major societal problem receiving increasing attention. Unlike Deep-fake, Out-of-Context misinformation, in which the unaltered unimode contents (e.g. image, text) of a multi-modal news sample are combined in an out-of-context manner to generate deception, requires limited technical expertise to create. Therefore, it is more prevalent a means to confuse readers. Most existing approaches extract features from its uni-mode counterparts to concatenate and train a model for the misinformation classification task. In this paper, we design a self-supervised feature representation learning strategy that aims to attain the multi-task objectives: (1) task-agnostic, which evaluates the intra- and inter-mode representational consistencies for improved alignments across related models; (2) task-specific, which estimates the category-specific multi-modal knowledge to enable the classifier to derive more discriminative predictive distributions. To compensate for the dearth of annotated data representing varied types of misinformation, the proposed Self-Supervised Distilled Learner (SSDL) utilizes a Teacher network to weakly guide a Student network to mimic a similar decision pattern as the teacher. The two-phased learning of SSDL can be summarized as: initial pretraining of the Student model using a combination of contrastive self-supervised task-agnostic objective and supervised task-specific adjustment in parallel; finetuning the Student model via self-supervised knowledge distillation blended with the supervised objective of decision alignment. In addition to the consistent out-performances over the existing baselines that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, the explainability capacity of the proposed SSDL also helps users visualize the reasoning behind a specific prediction made by the model.},

  pages={6424-6432},
  abstract={Knowledge distillation which learns a lightweight student model by distilling knowledge from a cumbersome teacher model is an attractive approach for learning compact deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent works further improve student network performance by leveraging multiple teacher networks. However, most of the existing knowledge distillation-based multi-teacher methods use separately pretrained teachers. This limits the collaborative learning between teachers and the mutual learning between teachers and student. Network quantization is another attractive approach for learning compact DNNs. However, most existing network quantization methods are developed and evaluated without considering multi-teacher support to enhance the performance of quantized student model. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages both multi-teacher knowledge distillation and network quantization for learning low bit-width DNNs. The proposed method encourages both collaborative learning between quantized teachers and mutual learning between quantized teachers and quantized student. During learning process, at corresponding layers, knowledge from teachers will form an importance-aware shared knowledge which will be used as input for teachers at subsequent layers and also be used to guide student. Our experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets show that the compact quantized student models trained with our method achieve competitive results compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and in some cases, surpass the full precision models.},

  abstract={Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a vital component of intelligent video analytics applications such as surveillance and autonomous driving. The time and storage complexity required to execute deep learning models for visual object tracking hinder their adoption on embedded devices with limited computing power. In this paper, we aim to accelerate MOT by transferring the knowledge from high-level features of a complex network (teacher) to a lightweight network (student) at both training and inference times. The proposed AttTrack framework has three key components: 1) cross-model feature learning to align intermediate representations from the teacher and student models, 2) interleaving the execution of the two models at inference time, and 3) incorporating the updated predictions from the teacher model as prior knowledge to assist the student model. Experiments on pedestrian tracking tasks are conducted on the MOT17 and MOT15 datasets using two different object detection backbones YOLOv5 and DLA34 show that AttTrack can significantly improve student model tracking performance while sacrificing only minor degradation of tracking speed.},

  abstract={Inspired by recent advances in vision transformers for object detection, we propose Li3DeTr, an end-to-end LiDAR based 3D Detection Transformer for autonomous driving, that inputs LiDAR point clouds and regresses 3D bounding boxes. The LiDAR local and global features are encoded using sparse convolution and multi-scale deformable attention respectively. In the decoder head, firstly, in the novel Li3DeTr cross-attention block, we link the LiDAR global features to 3D predictions leveraging the sparse set of object queries learnt from the data. Secondly, the object query interactions are formulated using multi-head self-attention. Finally, the decoder layer is repeated Ldec number of times to refine the object queries. Inspired by DETR, we employ set-to-set loss to train the Li3DeTr network. Without bells and whistles, the Li3DeTr network achieves 61.3% mAP and 67.6% NDS surpassing the state-of-the-art methods with non-maximum suppression (NMS) on the nuScenes dataset and it also achieves competitive performance on the KITTI dataset. We also employ knowledge distillation (KD) using a teacher and student model that slightly improves the performance of our network.},

  title={Adversarial local distribution regularization for knowledge distillation}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={4670-4679},
  abstract={Knowledge distillation is a process of distilling information from a large model with significant knowledge capacity (teacher) to enhance a smaller model (student). Therefore, exploring the properties of the teacher is the key to improving student performance (e.g., teacher decision boundaries). One decision boundary exploring technique is to leverage adversarial attack methods, which add crafted perturbations within a ball constraint to clean inputs to create attack examples of the teacher called adversarial examples. These adversarial examples are informative examples because they are near decision boundaries. In this paper, we formulate a teacher adversarial local distribution, a set of all adversarial examples within the ball constraint given an input. This distribution is used to sufficiently explore the decision boundaries of the teacher by covering the full spectrum of possible teacher model perturbations. The student model is then regularized by matching the loss between teacher and student using these adversarial example inputs. We conducted a number of experiments on CIFAR-100 and Imagenet datasets to illustrate this teacher adversarial local distribution regularization (TALD) can be applied to improve performance of many existing knowledge distillation methods (e.g., KD, FitNet, CRD, VID, FT, etc.).},

  year={2023},

  abstract={Network slicing (NS) provides customized services to users of the Internet of Things (IoT) by creating logical virtual networks, and NS combined with multiaccess edge computing (MEC) can significantly minimize the latency for delay-sensitive service. Therefore, it is important to research how to employ NS to achieve low latency for delay-sensitive service in MEC-enabled IoT. In this article, we propose a paradigm of dynamic cooperative slicing based on the digital twin network (DTN) to achieve low latency for delay-sensitive service. Specifically, we first build a DTN for the MEC-enabled IoT, and build basic models and function models, including prediction and decision making in DTN. Then, we realize dynamic cooperative slicing through the built basic models and function models. Second, with the assistance of the ubiquitous computing resources in MEC-enabled IoT based on DTN, we construct joint optimization problem of communication resources, computing resources, and collaboration proportion with the objective of ensuring low delay of delay-sensitive service while maximizing the long-term utility of operators. Third, considering that the different MEC servers participating in the cooperation in each time slot lead to different action spaces in different time slots, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm with variable action space, called VADDPG, which draws on the idea of action masking and introduces the action adjustor to realize the hard control of action space. Finally, a large number of simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithms in terms of both the long-term utility of operators and the delay obtained by slicing.},

  pages={20337-20350},
  abstract={Current deep learning-assisted brain tumor classification models sustain inductive bias and parameter dependency problems for extracting texture-based image information. Thereby concerning these problems, the recent development of the vision transformer model has substituted the DL model for classification tasks. However, the high performance of the vision transformer model depends on a large-scale dataset as well as self-attention calculations between the number of image patches which result in a quadratic computational complexity. To address these problems, the vision transformer must be data-efficient to be well-trained with a limited amount of data, and the computational complexity must be linear with the number of image patches. Consequently, this paper presents a novel linear-complexity data-efficient image transformer called LCDEiT for training with small-size datasets by using a teacher-student strategy and linear computational complexity concerning the number of patches using an external attention mechanism. The teacher model comprised a custom gated-pooled convolutional neural network to provide knowledge to the transformer-based student model for the classification of MRI brain tumors. The average classification accuracy and F1-score for two benchmark datasets including Figshare and BraTS-21 are found 98.11% and 97.86% and 93.69% and 93.68% respectively. The results indicate that the proposed model could have a great impact on medical imaging-based diagnosis where data availability and faster computations are the main concern.},

  abstract={To meet the stringent service requirements of 6G applications such as immersive cloud eXtended Reality (XR), holographic communication, and digital twin, there is no doubt that an increasing number of servers will be deployed on the network edge. Then, the techniques, edge computing, edge caching, and edge intelligence will be more widely utilized for intelligent local data storage and processing generated by 6G applications, while innovative access network architecture based on the cloud-edge servers, such as the Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) will be adopted to improve the flexibility and openness for new service deployment and frequent network changes. On the other hand, new attack surfaces and vectors targeting local infrastructure and users will emerge along with the deployment of novel network architecture and techniques. Massive researchers have studied the potential security and privacy threats on the 6G network edge as well as the countermeasures. The three techniques, edge computing, edge caching, and edge intelligence have become a double-edged sword that can not only be synchronously utilized to develop defense countermeasures, but also become the targets of many new security and privacy threats. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of articles on the three techniques-related security threats and countermeasures on the 6G network edge. We explain how security and privacy can be destroyed by attacking one of the three technologies and how the three services support each other to realize efficient and achievable security protection. Moreover, the researches on the benefits and limitations of Federated Learning (FL) and blockchain for decentralized edge network systems in terms of security and privacy are also investigated. Additionally, we also analyze the existing challenges and future directions towards 6G.},

  abstract={This paper considers the cooperative search for stationary targets by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited sensing range and communication ability in a dynamic threatening environment. The main purpose is to use multiple UAVs to find more unknown targets as soon as possible, increase the coverage rate of the mission area, and more importantly, guide UAVs away from threats. However, traditional search methods are mostly unscalable and perform poorly in dynamic environments. A new multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) method, DNQMIX, is proposed in this study to solve the multi-UAV cooperative target search (MCTS) problem. The reward function is also newly designed for the MCTS problem to guide UAVs to explore and exploit the environment information more efficiently. Moreover, this paper proposes a digital twin (DT) driven training framework “centralized training, decentralized execution, and continuous evolution” (CTDECE). It can facilitate the continuous evolution of MADRL models and solve the tradeoff between training speed and environment fidelity when MADRL is applied to real-world multi-UAV systems. Simulation results show that DNQMIX outperforms state-of-art methods in terms of search rate and coverage rate.},

We then have leveraged the soft target distribution of the teacher model to supervise the training of a lightweight student model. In such a way, the student model can learn the knowledge from the teacher model, with an energy-efficient structure that has significantly less parameters. Evaluated on the cardiac disease detection task, our framework has demonstrated promising effectiveness, and this study will therefore greatly advance efficient wearable data mining on the edge in consumer electronics.},

  pages={9096-9107},
  abstract={Deep hashing has proven to be efficient and effective for large-scale face retrieval. However, existing hashing methods are designed for normal face images only. They fail to consider the fact that face images may be occluded because of wearing masks, hats, glasses, etc. Retrieval performance of existing face retrieval methods is much worse when dealing with occluded face images. In this work, we propose the knowledge distillation hashing (KDH) to deal with occluded face images. The KDH is a two-stage learning approach with teacher-student model distillation. We first train a teacher hashing network using normal face images and then the knowledge from teacher model is used to guide the optimization of the student model using occluded face images as input only. With knowledge distillation, we build a connection between imperfect face information and the optimal hash codes. Experimental results show that the KDH yields significant improvements and better retrieval performance in comparison to existing state-of-the-art deep hashing retrieval methods under six different face occlusion situations.},

  abstract={Intelligent machine fault diagnosis technique has recently exploded interest in digital health, energy power, and industrial maintenance. Collecting machine fault data in engineering practice is usually costly, causing big challenges in the intelligent diagnosis of most fresh-from-the-factory machines that are missing fault data. Inspired by the main idea of the digital twin, in this article, we propose a dynamic model-embedded intelligent machine fault diagnosis framework. Specifically, a machine dynamic modeling and parameter identification approach is introduced for building the machine digital model. The digital model is used to predict machine fault data from the measured healthy vibration signals. Furthermore, a parameterized convolutional neural network structure is designed for learning optimization features and recognizing the machine's healthy state. Experimental investigation demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework. The results show that the proposed framework enables intelligent machine fault diagnosis without fault data. The diagnosis effect outperforms supervised, unsupervised, and small-sample learning approaches and can be generalized to another load and speed with acceptable accuracy.},

  abstract={With the recent advances of the Internet of Things (IoT), innovative techniques, and concepts have emerged, such as digital twins and industrial 4.0. As one of the essential parts of a digital twin, IoT-based smart predictive maintenance (IoT-SPM) is a key enabling technology for smart manufacturing. This article introduces digital twins and their relationship to IoT-SPM and proposes a reference IoT-SPM, aiming to provide a comprehensive and systematic outlook for the IoT-SPM field. Thus, it can be used as a guide map for interested readers. To give a complete picture of the IoT-SPM ecosystem in industrial 4.0 systems, this article conducts an analysis from multiview perspectives, starting with the architecture, followed by platforms and component. The key components or requirements of an IoT-SPM ecosystem are identified and outlined, including the IoT and cyber–physical system (CPS) as the cornerstone technologies, IoT monitoring data as the base, big data platforms as the backbone, an upgraded computing paradigm as the catalyst, and machine learning-based data analysis as the main processor. This article also focuses on the issues surrounding IoT data when applying analytic models to a real-world industrial IoT system. Then, the current progresses relating IoT and IoT-SPM are depicted, and a research gap on IoT data quality is identified. In particular, regarding the identified IoT data quality problems, this article qualitatively evaluates and discusses the existing solutions. These discussions lead to several open research issues and future directions.},

  year={2023},
  volume={42},
  number={8},
  pages={2189-2199},
  abstract={Deep learning based image enhancement models have largely improved the readability of fundus images in order to decrease the uncertainty of clinical observations and the risk of misdiagnosis. However, due to the difficulty of acquiring paired real fundus images at different qualities, most existing methods have to adopt synthetic image pairs as training data. The domain shift between the synthetic and the real images inevitably hinders the generalization of such models on clinical data. In this work, we propose an end-to-end optimized teacher-student framework to simultaneously conduct image enhancement and domain adaptation. The student network uses synthetic pairs for supervised enhancement, and regularizes the enhancement model to reduce domain-shift by enforcing teacher-student prediction consistency on the real fundus images without relying on enhanced ground-truth. Moreover, we also propose a novel multi-stage multi-attention guided enhancement network (MAGE-Net) as the backbones of our teacher and student network. Our MAGE-Net utilizes multi-stage enhancement module and retinal structure preservation module to progressively integrate the multi-scale features and simultaneously preserve the retinal structures for better fundus image quality enhancement. Comprehensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms the baseline approaches. Moreover, our method also benefits the downstream clinical tasks.},

  abstract={This article compares two state-of-the-art text input techniques between non-stationary virtual reality (VR) and video see-through augmented reality (VST AR) use-cases as XR display condition. The developed contact-based mid-air virtual tap and word-gesture (swipe) keyboard provide established support functions for text correction, word suggestions, capitalization, and punctuation. A user evaluation with 64 participants revealed that XR displays and input techniques strongly affect text entry performance, while subjective measures are only influenced by the input techniques. We found significantly higher usability and user experience ratings for tap keyboards compared to swipe keyboards in both VR and VST AR. Task load was also lower for tap keyboards. In terms of performance, both input techniques were significantly faster in VR than in VST AR. Further, the tap keyboard was significantly faster than the swipe keyboard in VR. Participants showed a significant learning effect with only ten sentences typed per condition. Our results are consistent with previous work in VR and optical see-through (OST) AR, but additionally provide novel insights into usability and performance of the selected text input techniques for VST AR. The significant differences in subjective and objective measures emphasize the importance of specific evaluations for each possible combination of input techniques and XR displays to provide reusable, reliable, and high-quality text input solutions. With our work, we form a foundation for future research and XR workspaces. Our reference implementation is publicly available to encourage replicability and reuse in future XR workspaces.},

  title={Digital Twin-Based Cyber-Attack Detection Framework for Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Systems}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-18},
  abstract={Smart manufacturing (SM) systems utilize run-time data to improve productivity via intelligent decision-making and analysis mechanisms on both machine and system levels. The increased adoption of cyber-physical systems in SM leads to the comprehensive framework of cyber-physical manufacturing systems (CPMS) where data-enabled decision-making mechanisms are coupled with cyber-physical resources on the plant floor. Due to their cyber-physical nature, CPMS are susceptible to cyber-attacks that may cause harm to the manufacturing system, products, or even the human workers involved in this context. Therefore, detecting cyber-attacks efficiently and timely is a crucial step toward implementing and securing high-performance CPMS in practice. This paper addresses two key challenges to CPMS cyber-attack detection. The first challenge is distinguishing expected anomalies in the system from cyber-attacks. The second challenge is the identification of cyber-attacks during the transient response of CPMS due to closed-loop controllers. Digital twin (DT) technology emerges as a promising solution for providing additional insights into the physical process (twin) by leveraging run-time data, models, and analytics. In this work, we propose a DT framework for detecting cyber-attacks in CPMS during controlled transient behavior as well as expected anomalies of the physical process. We present a DT framework and provide details on structuring the architecture to support cyber-attack detection. Additionally, we present an experimental case study on off-the-shelf 3D printers to detect cyber-attacks utilizing the proposed DT framework to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Note to Practitioners—This work is motivated by developing a general-purpose and extensible digital twin-enabled cyber-attack detection framework for manufacturing systems. Existing works in the field consider specialized attack scenarios and models that may not be extensible in practical manufacturing scenarios. We utilize digital twin (DT) technology as a key enabler to develop a systematic and extensible framework where we identify the abnormality of a resource and detect if the abnormality is due to an attack or an expected anomaly. We provide several remarks on how our proposed framework can extend existing industrial control systems (ICS) and can accommodate further extensions. The presented DTs utilize data-driven machine learning models, physics-based models, and subject matter expert knowledge to perform detection and differentiation tasks in the context of expected anomalies and model-based controllers that control the manufacturing process between multiple setpoints. We utilize a model predictive controller on an off-the-shelf 3D printer to run the process, and stage anomalies and cyber-attacks that are successfully detected by the proposed framework.},

  abstract={We propose a distributed optical fiber sensing event recognition scheme based on Markov Transition Field (MTF) and knowledge distillation. The event recognition algorithm has the advantages of being lightweight, fast, and high accuracy. The event data are converted into images by the MTF algorithm, which keeps the event signals correlated in the time domain while highlighting the visual differences between different events. A two-stage knowledge distillation model compression method is proposed, which effectively compresses the large-scale model into a lightweight model with optimal learning capability, ensuring the lightweight and efficient recognition of events by the compressed model (student model). The experimental results show that the student model improves the recognition rate of six events by 5.2% and achieves 96.6% event recognition accuracy by the two-stage knowledge distillation method. The size of the student model is only 1.4 MB, the number of parameters is only 0.35 M, and the FLOPs are only 0.17 G. The student model recognizes a single event in 0.129s on a low configuration device, which can meet the requirements of deployment and real-time monitoring of resource-limited devices.},

  year={2023},

  pages={20399-20417},
  abstract={Data mining approaches have proven to be successful in improving learners’ interaction with educational computer games. Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners’ performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners’ final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners’ actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners’ performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners’ action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial in the deep learning model.},

  abstract={The state of the art semi-supervised learning framework has greatly shown its potential in making deep and complex language models such as BERT highly effective for text classification tasks when labeled data is limited. However, the large size and low inference speed of such models may hinder their application on resources-limited or real-time use cases. In this paper, we propose a new approach in semi-supervised learning framework to distill large complex teacher model into a fairly lightweight student model which has the ability of acquiring knowledge from different layers of teacher with the usage of  $K$ -way projecting networks. Across four English datasets in text classification benchmarks and one dataset collected from an Chinese online course, our experiment shows that this student model achieves comparable results with the state of the art Transformer-based semi-supervised text classification methods, while using only 0.156MB parameters and having an inference speed 785 times faster than the teacher model.},

  abstract={Disassembly is an inevitable process of recycling end-of-life products and robotic disassembly sequence planning could improve disassembly efficiency. However, the missing condition of component is uncertain and it could not be pre-known before execution of disassembly process. The optimal solution should be dynamically generated according to the recognized condition during disassembly process. In this article, digital twin is utilized to solve robotic disassembly sequence dynamic planning under uncertain missing condition. First, the framework of the proposed method is studied and digital twin of robotic disassembly process is established. Afterwards, deep Q-learning network is utilized to solve the proposed problem. Finally, case studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of proposed method. The results show the converged deep Q-learning network model could dynamically find the optimal solutions after the missing condition of component is recognized during disassembly process using less running time, compared with the other meta-heuristics algorithms.},

  abstract={Integrating machine-learning (ML) models responsible for predicting the evolution of those directly collected or implicitly derived parameters enhances the smartness of industrial systems even further. In this article, data already residing in most modern electric drives has been used to establish a data-driven thermal model of power electronics modules. The developed method relies solely on existing information in the electric drive enabling its wide applicability. Adding more sensors to a product is a complicated task, thus it is not a desirable solution. For training and validating the thermal digital twin, a test bench has been designed specifically. Several approaches, from traditional linear models to deep neural networks, have been implemented to emanate the best ML model for estimating the case temperature of the module. Numerous evaluation metrics were then used to assess the investigated methods’ performance and implementation in industrial embedded systems. The proposed solution performed satisfactorily while the powertrain underwent various static and dynamic operating profiles. The model identified a blockage in the air outlet of the drive by monitoring the deviation of the measured and estimated temperatures, thus it prevented the power module from experiencing a fatal failure.},

  abstract={In this paper, to deal with the heterogeneity in federated learning (FL) systems, a knowledge distillation (KD) driven training framework for FL is proposed, where each user can select its neural network model on demand and distill knowledge from a big teacher model using its own private dataset. To overcome the challenge of train the big teacher model in resource limited user devices, the digital twin (DT) is exploit in the way that the teacher model can be trained at DT located in the server with enough computing resources. Then, during model distillation, each user can update the parameters of its model at either the physical entity or the digital agent. The joint problem of model selection and training offloading and resource allocation for users is formulated as a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem. To solve the problem, Q-learning and optimization are jointly used, where Q-learning selects models for users and determines whether to train locally or on the server, and optimization is used to allocate resources for users based on the output of Q-learning. Simulation results show the proposed DT-assisted KD framework and joint optimization method can significantly improve the average accuracy of users while reducing the total delay.},

In this paper, with the aim of developing energy-efficient digital twin in 6G, we investigate real-time video analytics based on cameras mounted on mobile devices with edge coordination. This problem is challenging because 1) mobile devices are with limited battery life and lightweight computation capability, and 2) the captured video frames of mobile devices are continuous changing, which makes the corresponding tasks arrival uncertain. To achieve energy-efficient video analytics in digital twin, by taking energy consumption, analytics accuracy, and latency into consideration, we formulate a deep reinforcement learning based mobile device and edge coordination video analytics framework, which can utilized digital twin models to achieve joint offloading decision and configuration selection. The edge nodes help to collect the information on network topology and task arrival.

An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the weighted sum of the DT loss function and DT model training delay. Then, the problem is transformed and solved by the proposed Multi-timescAle endogenouS securiTy-aware DQN-based rEsouRce management algorithm (MASTER) based on DT-assisted state information evaluation and attack detection. MASTER adopts multi-timescale deep Q-learning (DQN) networks to jointly schedule local training epochs and devices.

  abstract={A digital twin uses a virtual model of the physical system to fulfill the diverse requirements (e.g., latency, reliability, quality of physical experience) for emerging vehicular network applications. Although a twin-based implementation of vehicular networks can offer performance optimization, modeling a digital twin is a significantly challenging task. Federated learning (FL) is a better privacy-preserving, distributed learning scheme that can be used to model twin models. Although FL can offer performance enhancement, it requires careful design. Therefore, in this article, we present an overview of FL for a twinbased vehicular network. A general architecture for FL-enabled digital twins for a vehicular network is presented. Our proposed architecture consists of two spaces, such as twin space and the physical space. A physical space consists of all the physical entities (e.g., cars and edge servers) required for vehicular networks, whereas, the twin space refers to the logical space that is used for the deployment of twins. A twin space can be implemented either using edge servers and cloud servers. We also outline a few use cases of FL for the twin-based vehicular network.

  pages={2421-2428},
  abstract={Deep learning has revolutionized the field of robotics. To deal with the lack of annotated training samples for learning deep models in robotics, Sim-to-Real transfer has been invented and widely used. However, such deep models trained in simulation environment typically do not transfer very well to the real world due to the challenging problem of “reality gap”. In response, this letter presents a conceptually new Digital Twin (DT)-CycleGAN framework by integrating the advantages of both DT methodology and the CycleGAN model so that the reality gap can be effectively bridged. Our core innovation is that real and virtual DT robots are forced to mimic each other in a way that the gaps or differences between simulated and realistic robotic behaviors are minimized. To effectively realize this innovation, visual grasping is employed as an exemplar robotic task, and the reality gap in zero-shot Sim-to-Real transfer of visual grasping models is defined as grasping action consistency losses and intrinsically penalized during the DT-CycleGAN training process in realistic simulation environments. Specifically, first, cycle consistency losses between real visual images and simulation images are defined and minimized to reduce the reality gaps in visual appearances during visual grasping tasks. Second, the grasping agent's action consistency losses are defined and penalized to minimize the inconsistency of the grasping agent's actions between the virtual states generated by the DT-CycleGAN generator and the real visual states. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our novel DT-CycleGAN framework for zero-shot Sim-to-Real transfer.},

  year={2023},
  volume={33},
  number={10},
  pages={5486-5497},
  abstract={Cross-modal retrieval aims to enable a flexible bi-directional retrieval experience across different modalities (e.g., searching for videos with texts). Many existing efforts tend to learn a common semantic representation embedding space in which items of different modalities can be directly compared, wherein the positive global representations of video-text pairs are pulled close while the negative ones are pushed apart via pair-wise ranking loss. However, such a vanilla loss would unfortunately yield ambiguous feature embeddings for texts of different videos, causing inaccurate cross-modal matching and unreliable retrievals. Toward this end, we propose a multimodal contrastive knowledge distillation method for instance video-text retrieval, called MCKD, by adaptively using the general knowledge of self-supervised model (teacher) to calibrate mixed boundaries. Specifically, the teacher model is tailored for robust (less-ambiguous) visual-text joint semantic space by maximizing mutual information of co-occurred modalities during multimodal contrastive learning. This robust and structural inter-instance knowledge is then distilled, with the help of explicit discrimination loss, to a student model for improved matching performance. Extensive experiments on four public benchmark video-text datasets (MSR-VTT, TGIF, VATEX, and Youtube2Text) demonstrate that our MCKD can achieve at most 8.8%, 6.4%, 5.9%, and 5.3% improvement in text-to-video performance by the  $\text{R}\text{@}1$  metric, compared with 14 SoTA baselines.},

  abstract={A fundamental issue of the vehicular digital twin (DT) is efficiently synchronizing the data between the DT and the vehicular user (VUE). In this paper, we consider the heterogeneous vehicular networks (HetVNets) in which a VUE can connect to the network through different networks. The HetVNets can improve the efficiency of communication by providing seamless connections. However, the uneven distribution of VUEs and the dynamics of HetVNets make the environment more complex. Therefore, we propose the network selection algorithm for data synchronization between VUEs and DTs in the HetVNets, where the behaviour between the VUEs is considered as a competition for wireless resources. A learning-based prediction model residing in the DT is developed where the DT can predict the waiting time of each relay and transmit the predicted results to the VUE for decision-making. We model the network selection problem as a potential game considering both the transmission time and the waiting time obtained from the prediction model and prove the existence of Nash equilibrium (NE). We analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm, and simulation results show that our approach can effectively find the optimal strategy while achieving a fast convergence speed and high-level performance compared to the baselines.},

  abstract={Nowadays, mobile application services face the challenges of high speed, low latency and high reliability. The combination of digital twin (DT) technology and mobile edge computing (MEC) network can effectively solve these challenges. DT technology can help MEC network monitor and predict the network states. In this paper, we propose a DT-aided MEC network scenario with deep neural network (DNN) inference as the computing task of end devices (EDs). ED can offload part of DNN layers to MEC server. To allocate communication resources, we propose an algorithm based on asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C), which manages the transmission power and channel selection of EDs. Since DNN inference is continuous in real scenes, we consider the continuous DNN inference tasks. We convert the DNN optimal partition point solving problem to a min st-cut problem, and propose a graph theory based DNN optimal partition point solving algorithm to minimize the inference latency. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the inference latency. Compared with actor-critic (AC) and deep Q network (DQN), the proposed algorithm has faster convergence speed and better convergence value. Compared with the traditional one-time DNN model partition algorithm, the proposed algorithm is more suitable for DNN continuous task arrival scenario.},

Here, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methodologies have an essential role in handling the management complexity of this hard-to-follow environment. However, these methodologies increase the computational complexity of aircraft due to the continuous update, convergence time, and scalability issues. At that point, we propose the utilization of the Digital Twin (DT) technology to handle the management complexity of AANET while solving the main issues of AI-based methodologies on it. The DT can virtually replicate the physical AANET components through closed-loop feedback in real-time. Therefore, this work introduces the utilization of DT technology for the AANET orchestration and, accordingly, proposes a DT-enabled AANET (DT-AANET) topology management framework. This framework consists of the Physical AANET Twin and Controller, including Digital AANET Twin with Operational Module. Here, the Digital AANET Twin virtually represents the physical environment while the operational module executes the AI-based computations on them through unsupervised learning-based training or supervised learning-based prediction. Finally, we present a case study based on Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) to show the usability of the proposed framework and support this through evaluation results.},

  abstract={A core issue of safe human-machine cooperative driving lies in dynamic assessment of the rapidly evolving driving risks. Given that, this paper proposes a shared controller for safe and human-friendly cooperative driving based on predictive risk assessment enabled by Digital Twin technologies. In the digital world, we create a fine-grained digital replica of the driving scene comprising historical motions of vehicles, as well as roadway geometries and topologies. On the basis of that, spatial-temporal interactive features are obtained with a deep learning-based model and subsequently decoded to predict future trajectories of each target vehicle in the neighborhood of the ego-vehicle. In the physical world, the predicted trajectories of neighboring vehicles are integrated into the risk distribution to construct predictive risk fields. A novel shared controller in the framework of multi-objective MPC is designed to minimize the driving risk while matching driver's commands, so that safe cooperative driving is achieved in a smooth and minimal-intervention manner. The results of driver-in-the-loop simulation experiments demonstrate the enabling role of the Digital Twin in improving the assessment of risk in highly dynamic scenes through taking the motion trends of dynamic agents into account. The results also show the superiority of the Digital Twin-based shared controller in terms of implementing cooperation in time while honoring the driver's commands whenever possible.},

  pages={2650-2660},
  abstract={Deep learning has been widely used in intelligent vehicle driving perception systems, such as 3D object detection. One promising technique is Cooperative Perception, which leverages Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication to share deep learning-based features among vehicles. However, most cooperative perception algorithms assume ideal communication and do not consider the impact of Lossy Communication (LC), which is very common in the real world, on feature sharing. In this paper, we explore the effects of LC on Cooperative Perception and propose a novel approach to mitigate these effects. Our approach includes an LC-aware Repair Network (LCRN) and a V2V Attention Module (V2VAM) with intra-vehicle attention and uncertainty-aware inter-vehicle attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the public OPV2V dataset (a digital-twin simulated dataset) using point cloud-based 3D object detection. Our results show that our approach improves detection performance under lossy V2V communication. Specifically, our proposed method achieves a significant improvement in Average Precision compared to the state-of-the-art cooperative perception algorithms, which proves the capability of our approach to effectively mitigate the negative impact of LC and enhance the interaction between the ego vehicle and other vehicles.},

  abstract={Cell-free networking enables full cooperation among distributed access points (APs). This paper focuses on reducing the long-term energy consumption of a cell-free network in the downlink integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) for achieving energy sustainability. The resultant design includes both the AP classification on a large time-scale and the beamforming of the APs on a small time-scale in order to simultaneously satisfy the IDET requirements of data users and energy users. For dealing with binary integer actions (AP classification) and continuous actions (beamforming) together, we innovatively propose a stable double parameterized deep-Q-network (DP-DQN), which can be enhanced by a digital twin (DT) running in the intelligent core processor (ICP) so as to achieve faster and more stable convergence. Therefore, the cell-free network may avoid suffering from performance fluctuation during the training process. The simulation results demonstrate that our DP-DQN exceeds in convergence compared to other benchmarks while guaranteeing an optimal solution.},

  abstract={This work introduces a novel architecture of federated learning (FL)-enabled digital twin (DT) for the smart additive manufacturing industry, especially 3D printing. The proposed architecture tackles the previous limitation of the centralized approach that requires a large number of communication costs by efficiently updating the fault detection model on each server with distributed learning methods. A CNN-based model is also proposed to efficiently learn sensory data from a 3D printer for a fast and reliable fault detection model. To provide a robust system in intelligent manufacturing, a DT platform is also designed for seamless monitoring and control purposes. The proposed DT platform is able to initiate, monitor, and terminate the 3D printing process of physical assets via a virtual environment. Based on the simulation results, the FL process demonstrates that the proposed CNN-based model is superior to other DL models with 8% accuracy enlargement while maintaining the low training period. Furthermore, experimental work is conducted to evaluate the proposed architecture with real-world devices. Finally, the findings indicate that the overall latency given by the proposed system is relatively low, with an average of 1026.16 ms from the physical 3D printer to the DT platform.},

  abstract={Machine teaching is an inverse problem of machine learning that aims at steering the student toward its target hypothesis, in which the teacher has already known the student’s learning parameters. Previous studies on machine teaching focused on balancing the teaching risk and cost to find the best teaching examples deriving from the student model. This optimization solver is in general ineffective when the student does not disclose any cue of the learning parameters. To supervise such a teaching scenario, this article presents a distribution matching-based machine teaching strategy via iteratively shrinking the teaching cost in a smooth surrogate, which eliminates boundary perturbations from the version space. Technically, our strategy could be redefined as a cost-controlled optimization process that finds the optimal teaching examples without further exploring the parameter distribution of the student. Then, given any limited teaching cost, the training examples would have a closed-form expression. Theoretical analysis and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy.},

In response to this problem, the digital twin technology is introduced into the teaching practice of robotics, and a bidirectional linkage robot digital twin system based on ROS is developed. The system uses Unreal Engine 4 to build the virtual space. The robot twin is constructed in virtual space to simulate and provide feedback on the state of a real robot in physical space. The digital twin of the robot is programmed and debugged through a custom ROS interface to enable motion planning of the real robot, thus enabling virtual-real interaction. It collects and analyzes the robot's working status in real-time while the robot is operating and maps the robot twin to the real robot in real time to achieve remote 3D real-time monitoring of the robot. The system was tested on the pavilion and UR5 robots, respectively, and was feasible with a response time of 38ms.},

To address such a challenging problem, we then build the computation offloading process as a Markov decision process and propose a deep reinforcement learning-based proximal policy optimization algorithm to dynamically learn the computation offloading strategy and trajectory design policy. Numerical results indicate that our proposed algorithm can achieve quick convergence rate and significantly reduce the system energy consumption.},

  abstract={As a three-layer association of Internet of Things Equipment (IoTE)–network slicing (NS)–base station (BS) in radio access network (RAN) slicing, handoff control, and resource allocation has become an important but complicated issue. In addition, the centralized controller has a difficult grasping the network situation in real time. In view of this, the problem of handoff control in the RAN slicing is investigated in the digital twin network (DTN), with the goal of maximizing the long-term utility about user satisfaction and handoff cost. Then, an improved algorithm based on the actor–critic framework is suggested, which is called HCRA. Specifically, the actor component contains neural networks for handoff control and an optimizer for resource allocation, and then the critic component evaluates the handoff and resource allocation actions of the actor component to guide the optimization of actions in the actor component. The simulation results show that HCRA can obtain better performance than benchmark algorithms.},

  pages={4715-4728},
  abstract={In Industry 5.0 vision, machines are empowered with the interaction capability to autonomously make local decisions and coordinate with each other as well as humans. However, how to form a group consensus on the rapid self-organizing of the manufacturing process is critical for achieving manufacturing resilience under disturbances and disruptions. Based on our formerly developed system ManuChain (Leng et al., 2020), this article proposes a blockchained smart contract system (BSCS), named ManuChain II, as the digital twin of a decentralized autonomous manufacturing system for achieving resilience in Industry 5.0. A blockchain-secured multiagent system architecture together with a product data model is established to form the BSCS. The BSCS could prevent tampering with data and enhance the transparency of the product manufacturing process. In BSCS, two types of blockchained smart contracts (SCs) are established with a bi-level interplay computing architecture. The lower-level contracts perform the predefined and learned patterns of task coordination for achieving resilience under internal disruptions. The upper-level contracts are incorporated with communication-efficient decentralized deep-learning algorithms for the learning, updating, transferring, and sharing of coordination patterns used in the autonomous decision in lower-level SCs, thereby achieving the continuous improvement of the system’s decentralized autonomous intelligence. Via incorporating the decentralized deep learning algorithms into blockchained SCs, this study reveals a new way to realize the self-organizing intelligence of the manufacturing system for enhancing resilience toward Industry 5.0.},

  abstract={A digital twin is a widely used method that uses digitized simulations of the real-world characteristics because it is effective in predicting results at a low cost. In digital twin analysis, the transfer function between the input and output data is an important research subject. In this study, we intend to investigate the application of the digital twin method to dust particle sensing. A high-performance multi-channel reference dust particle sensor provides particle count as well as particulate matter information, whereas a lightweight embedded test device only provides a particle count. The particulate matter acquisition algorithm for a reference device is unknown and complex. Instead of that, we propose a simple method to calculate the transfer function using singular-value decomposition. In the experimental results, using singular-value decomposition, the predicted particulate matter of the test device was similar to that of the reference device. The obtained transfer function shows similar measurement results of the two dust particle sensor devices, confirming that particulate matter environmental information can be digitized even with low-power and lightweight sensor-embedded devices. In addition, the power consumption of the test device was approximately ten times lower than that of the reference device.},

  year={2023},
  volume={10},

  pages={15362-15375},
  abstract={Most existing multiunmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) systems focus on fly path or energy consumption for task assignment, while little attention has been paid to the dynamic feature of the task, resulting in poor task completion ratio. The machine learning (ML) paradigm provides new methodologies for task assignment. However, ML methods are usually of heavy resource-consumption that cannot be directly applied in the UAV. In this article, a digital-twin (DT)-assisted task assignment approach is proposed to improve the resource-intensive utilization and the efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in multi-UAV system. The approach has a three-layer network structure which can dynamically assign tasks based on the task time constraints. Moreover, the approach is divided into two stages of initial task-assignment and task-reassignment. In the first stage, airship divides a task into multiple subtasks according to the shortest distance based on genetic algorithm and assigns them to UAVs. In the second stage, the DT can be leveraged to enable the airships to learn from the features of tasks and to generate the  $Q$ -value of the estimated value network of DRL for UAVs via pretrain of DT. The  $Q$ -value can be directly applied for deep  $Q$ -learning network (DQN) in the UAVs to reduce the training episode. Furthermore, the DQN is adopted to train task-reassignment strategy. Simulation results indicate that the DQN with DT can significantly reduce the training episode, improving 30% of the task completion ratio and 19% of the system energy efficiency compared with that of the baseline methods.},

  abstract={Abnormal gait is a significant noncognitive biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD). Micro-Doppler radar (MDR), a nonwearable technology, can capture human gait movements for potential early ADRD risk assessment. In this article, we propose to design a systematic radar intelligence analysis for ARDR risk evaluation (STRIDE) integrating MDR sensors with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. STRIDE embeds a new deep learning (DL) classification framework. As a proof of concept, we develop a “digital twin” of STRIDE, consisting of a human walking simulation model and an MDR simulation model, to generate a gait signature dataset. Taking established human walking parameters, the walking model simulates individuals with ADRD under various conditions. The radar model based on electromagnetic scattering and the Doppler frequency shift model is employed to generate micro-Doppler signatures from different moving body parts (e.g., foot, limb, joint, torso, and shoulder). A band-dependent DL framework is developed to predict ADRD risks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of STRIDE for evaluating ADRD risk.},

Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical multiagent reinforcement learning approach to implement the framework, which can be trained in an end-to-end way. In the proposed approach, the communication interval of digital twin entities could adapt to time-varying environment. Extensive experiments on driving decision-making have been performed in traffic junction scenarios of different difficulties.

  abstract={SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONSThis paper presents a Design for Availability approach for repairable health care Systems and Solutions; based on a framework which merges modeling approaches with managing and balancing of Reliability and Maintainability characteristics. The approach is used to prioritize the required Design for Reliability and Maintainability activities during the development phases of health care Systems and Solutions. It is supported by an ‘easy’ and ‘intuitive’ web-based toolset.The presented approach is applicable to product development and continuous improvement of fielded systems. It also serves as an enabler of digital twins for further Availability optimization.The Design for Availability approach starts with modeling of the System and Solution design in the Availability Design Tool, considering existing and new functionalities as well as different maintenance types. This is done in a hierarchal way to manage complexity. Historical data analysis as well as change point analysis are used to predict the Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Life Cycle Cost of the Systems and Solutions under development.Field data on both Reliability as well as Maintainability aspects are obtained via a data pipeline, thereby connecting the web-based Availability Design Tool with the data lake. For non-part related Maintenance activities, work order text analytics with Deep Learning algorithms is used to classify the activities and their impact. This is fed to the Availability model to improve the overall predictive capability of the model.With the Availability model and FMEA as inputs, a qualitative and quantitative analysis is executed to determine the Maintainability and Reliability of critical elements and parts in the proposed design. Easy execution of the FMEA is supported by a web based FMEA tool, allowing clear technical risk identification and prioritization.Based on the criticality analysis, work packages are defined. The work packages contain the Design for Reliability and Maintainability activities required, to ensure that the Systems and Solutions Availability and Life Cycle Cost objectives are met.Upon execution of the Design for Reliability and Maintainability activities, the initial model will require updates because of improved knowledge and understanding of probabilities of failure modes. This is also necessary due to the implemented design changes which mitigate the identified Reliability and Maintainability criticalities; either by preventing failures from occurring, implementation of fault tolerance or fault removal strategies.The approach allows for creating a hierarchical Availability model which includes Hardware as well as Software elements and feeding it with (near real-time) field data. This allows and prepares the model for use as digital twin for further optimization of the Availability of health care Systems and Solutions. The approach can be applied on an individual system as well as on multiple systems; enabled by an easy and free-to-use web-based toolset.},

  abstract={Deep learning has advanced dramatically in recent years, and especially large convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding performance in a wide variety of tasks. However, such large-scale CNNs may not be able to be utilized in practice because they require a lot of computational resources. Therefore, there is a need to realize a CNN in a small model that has high performance similar to the large CNN. One method to solve these problems is Distillation, which uses a model of large scale and high performance as the teacher and a small model as the student model, and performs model compression by transferring the knowledge of the teacher model to the student model. However, in distillation, even when the teacher model incorrectly guesses the training input, the student model learns to mimic the teacher. This can prevent the student model from learning better. In this paper, we propose Meritbased Distillation, in which the accuracy of the teacher model’s output determines the degree to which the student model mimics the teacher model’s output, thereby preventing the student to learn undesired mappings. In the experiment, the effect of the Merit-based Distillation is evaluated. Consequently, the proposed method outperforms the improvements in the generalization by the student models trained by other known methods.},

  abstract={A digital twin is a powerful tool that can help monitor and optimize physical assets in real-time. Simply put, it is a virtual representation of a physical asset, enabled through data and simulators, that can be used for a variety of purposes such as prediction, monitoring, and decision-making. However, the concept of digital twin can be vague and difficult to understand, which is why a new concept called “capability level” has been introduced. This concept categorizes digital twins based on their capability and defines a scale from zero to five, with each level indicating an increasing level of functionality. These levels are standalone, descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive, and autonomous. By understanding the capability level of a digital twin, we can better understand its potential and limitations. To demonstrate the concepts, we use a modern house as an example. The house is equipped with a range of sensors that collect data about its internal state, which can then be used to create digital twins of different capability levels. These digital twins can be visualized in virtual reality, allowing users to interact with and manipulate the virtual environment. The current work not only presents a blueprint for developing digital twins but also suggests future research directions to enhance this technology. Digital twins have the potential to transform the way we monitor and optimize physical assets, and by understanding their capabilities, we can unlock their full potential.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of deep learning technology, the size and performance of the network continuously grow, making network compression essential for commercial applications. In this paper, we propose a Feature Self Attention (FSA) module that extracts correlation information between the hidden features of a network and a new method for distilling the correlation features to compress the model. FSA does not require a special module or network to match features between the teacher model and the student model. By removing the multi-head structure and the repeated self-attention blocks in the existing self-attention mechanism, it minimizes the addition of parameters. Based on ResNet-18, 34, the added parameters are only 2.00M and the training speed is also the fastest in comparison to benchmark models. It was demonstrated through experiments that the use of interrelationship loss between features can be beneficial for training student models, indicating the importance of considering correlation information in deep neural network compression. And it was verified through training from scratch on the vanilla without the pre-trained weight of the student model.},

  abstract={Owing to the breakthrough in mobile wireless communication technologies, almost everyone has been immersed into social networks, while fake news and misinformation are also being pushed into people’s minds with astonishing speed and breadth. The rising disparity between limited computing resources and the exploding news size necessitates innovative solutions to handle the challenge posed by booming data volume and make it more likely to differentiate fake news. In response to the aforementioned dilemma, the social-aware computation offloading system is analyzed, where the digital twin (DT) paradigm is used to simulate tasks offloading and assess the associated costs. Next, to obtain the best offloading choice, we fully consider the social relationship constraints and further propose an online task execution method that includes two stages of cluster selection and computing offloading, named TOFDS. Specifically, it exploits the technologies from multiobjective optimization and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and realizes the joint optimization of resource utilization, load balancing, service latency, and energy consumption. Eventually, the comparative experiments demonstrate that TOFDS performs well when dealing with fake news data and can adapt to changes in dataset size and service clusters.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-15},
  abstract={Weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) aims to identify the snippets involving anomalous events in long untrimmed videos, with solely video-level binary labels. A typical paradigm among the existing WS-VAD methods is to employ multiple modalities as inputs, e.g., RGB, optical flow, and audio, as they can provide sufficient discriminative clues that are robust to the diverse, complicated real-world scenes. However, such a pipeline has high reliance on the availability of multiple modalities and is computationally expensive and storage demanding in processing long sequences, which limits its use in some applications. To address this dilemma, we propose a privileged knowledge distillation (KD) framework dedicated to the WS-VAD task, which can maintain the benefits of exploiting additional modalities, while avoiding the need for using multimodal data in the inference phase. We argue that the performance of the privileged KD framework mainly depends on two factors: 1) the effectiveness of the multimodal teacher network and 2) the completeness of the useful information transfer. To obtain a reliable teacher network, we propose a cross-modal interactive learning strategy and an anomaly normal discrimination loss, which target learning task-specific cross-modal features and encourage the separability of anomalous and normal representations, respectively. Furthermore, we design both representation-and logits-level distillation loss functions, which force the unimodal student network to distill abundant privileged knowledge from the well-trained multimodal teacher network, in a snippet-to-video fashion. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed privileged KD framework can train a lightweight yet effective detector, for localizing anomaly events under the supervision of video-level annotations.},

  year={2023},
  volume={10},
  number={18},
  pages={15931-15942},
  abstract={The data collected by sensors is streaming data in the Internet of Things (IoT). Although existing deep-learning-based anomaly detection methods generally perform well on static data, they struggle to respond timely to streaming data after distribution changes. However, streaming data suffers from conceptual drift due to the highly dynamic nature of IoT. In network security, concept drift-oriented anomaly detection is a crucial task, because it can adjust the model to adapt to the latest data, and detect attacks in time. Existing streaming anomaly detection methods are confronted with some challenges, including the latency of model updates, the uneven importance of new data, and the self-poisoning due to model self-updates. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a knowledge distillation-based adaptive anomaly detection model toward concept drift, ADTCD. ADTCD transfers the knowledge of the teacher model to the student model and only updates the student model to reduce the delay. We construct an algorithm of dynamically adjusting model parameters, which dynamically adjusts model weights through local inference on new samples, in order to improve the model’s responsiveness to new distribution data, meanwhile solving the problem of uneven importance of new data. In addition, we adopt a one-class support vector-based outlier removal method to tackle the self-poisoning problem. In comprehensive experiments on seven high-dimensional data sets, ADTCD achieves an AUC improvement of 12.46% compared to the state-of-the-art streaming anomaly detection methods. Our future direction will focus on exploring the concept-drift problem using methods beyond autoencoders.},

  year={2023},
  volume={72},
  number={},
  pages={1-13},
  abstract={Billet heating temperature directly affects the quality of the billet, but the existing technology cannot measure the billet surface temperature. Therefore, we accurately predict the temperature of the furnace by a soft sensor to approximate the billet temperature. Limited by the complexity of the heating process and the lack of computing resources in factories, the existing research pays little attention to or even cannot meet the temperature prediction requirements of multiple heating zones in multiple heating furnaces. To address the above problems, we propose a temperature prediction method for multiheating furnaces based on transfer learning and knowledge distillation. The method establishes a multisource domain model of a source domain furnace on a cloud platform. Then, the multisource knowledge is transferred to the target domain heating furnace, and the target domain teacher model is established by fine-tuning the source domain model through the target domain data. Next, to efficiently predict the furnace temperature, a shallow multitask student model is established at the edge server to predict multiple heating zones in the target furnace. Furthermore, a knowledge distillation method for regression prediction is proposed so that the student model can improve the prediction accuracy under the guidance of the cloud teacher model. The effectiveness of the method is verified by experiments on 20 different heating zone datasets in two heating furnaces and two wind turbine datasets. The consistency of multiple experiments shows that this method cannot only improve the accuracy by transferring the source domain knowledge but also reduce the size of model parameters by knowledge distillation on the premise of meeting the requirements of prediction error.},

  year={2023},
  volume={20},
  number={4},
  pages={4448-4460},
  abstract={Intelligent Virtual Machine (VM) provisioning is central to cost and resource efficient computation in cloud computing environments. As bootstrapping VMs is time-consuming, a key challenge for latency-critical tasks is to predict future workload demands to provision VMs proactively. However, existing AI-based solutions tend to not holistically consider all crucial aspects such as provisioning overheads, heterogeneous VM costs and Quality of Service (QoS) of the cloud system. To address this, we propose a novel method, called CILP, that formulates the VM provisioning problem as two sub-problems of prediction and optimization, where the provisioning plan is optimized based on predicted workload demands. CILP leverages a neural network as a surrogate model to predict future workload demands with a co-simulated digital-twin of the infrastructure to compute QoS scores. We extend the neural network to also act as an imitation learner that dynamically decides the optimal VM provisioning plan. A transformer based neural model reduces training and inference overheads while our novel two-phase decision making loop facilitates in making informed provisioning decisions. Crucially, we address limitations of prior work by including resource utilization, deployment costs and provisioning overheads to inform the provisioning decisions in our imitation learning framework. Experiments with three public benchmarks demonstrate that CILP gives up to 22% higher resource utilization, 14% higher QoS scores and 44% lower execution costs compared to the current online and offline optimization based state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Under the background of “Internet +” era, with the continuous progress of science and technology, the public has diversified requirements for museum visiting experience. The experience mode of both artistic taste and participation has become the development trend of Museum guidance. This paper discusses the application of interactive design based on BP neural network in Museum navigation. In this project, we use BP neural network to predict the user's next destination from the user's current location, and then display it on the map. BP neural network is used to predict the next destination according to the user's current location, and then display it on the map. BP neural network can be used as an intelligent system to identify objects or people by viewing images or videos. It is one of the most popular technologies because it has many advantages over other machine learning technologies (such as supervised and unsupervised learning methods), which cannot process video data. In this paper, the user behavior of visitors is collected by means of on-site research, structured interview, case tracking, online research, etc., and the user model of museum visitors is obtained through analysis and research, which provides the basis of user experience for practical design. By analyzing the cognitive characteristics of indoor geographic space, the principles of indoor map design are summarized, and the guiding principles for indoor navigation products of museums are obtained by considering the special scenes of museums, the needs of visitors and other factors.},

  abstract={Healthcare has always been a very profitable and resource-intensive industry, and it is also one of the only ones that have never reached a digital transformation peak. A network of 3D virtual worlds centered on social interaction is known as a metaverse. As the world becomes more dependent on technology, more consideration must be given to both individual privacy and the solutions offered by cybersecurity companies. In the metaverse, patient data security is a challenge. High-tech wearables including glasses, gloves, sensors, and other wearables that can detect patients' vital signs are needed in order to fully utilize the metaverse in healthcare. Technology is constrained since the hardware is still pricey and cannot be accessed by many members of society. The health Metaverse framework primarily focuses on telemedicine and online health management, multimodal medical information standards, the fusion of medical and social data, and medical artificial intelligence. Additionally, it offers crucial inventive dynamism in surgical procedures, medical education, and the interactions between service providers and clients. Technology improvements, gamification of healthcare, patient privacy protection, and barriers stopping individuals from giving up reality are all obstacles. This technological advancement had a lot to offer the ailing medical infrastructure industry, including telemedicine services, virtual examinations employing VR, AR, and blockchain to assure secure data and financial transmissions, as well as a variety of other as-yet untapped possibilities. Data security, data interoperability, and laws are just a few of the difficulties that the healthcare sector in the metaverse will face. To address these issues, new infrastructure, standards, and procedures will be required. This study looks at a number of issues that affect the healthcare industry and how to address them when the metaverse enters the mainstream of healthcare.},

Many organizations have taken additional steps to address this problem, like Apple introduced a new feature in IOS 14, Focus to disable application notifications so people can focus on their work. Similarly, Google added a feature in YouTube to show how much time is spent on YouTube for personal reflection. However, other organizations aren't as socially responsible compared to the above, and they're enticing users to spend more time in the digital world. To address this problem, the same technology empowering ads personalization can be utilized to provide digital learning personalization based on individuals' behavior metrics.

  abstract={For athletes, coaches, or rehabilitation patients, the systems currently used to perform biomechanical studies and the dependence on technical experts for interpreting analyses and results can limit organizational, logistical, and economic resources. In this project, a Recurrent Neural Network model was created to predict human joint accelerations through the automatic digitalization of human body movement using video and acceleration sensors. The project aimed to prevent injuries and fractures in athletes and the elderly population because there is a lack of tools that predicts the risk of these traumas as a preventive method. Acceleration data was collected using Matlab mobile installed in cell phones attached to the arms and legs of volunteers doing physical tasks (walking, running, jumping). Experiments were video recorded, and machine learning models were trained using acceleration and video using Python libraries. After model evaluation, we observed that the selected model could predict the best on the XY axes and the worst on the Z axis, probably due to predicting a three-dimensional feature with a two-dimensional input. A biomechanical Digital Twin was created by combining the information from wearable devices, computer vision, and machine learning algorithms. This tool was able to estimate human joint accelerations (up to an extent) during movements with more refinement; it can help to evaluate movement performance within exercises or tasks and aid in injury/fracture risk prediction.},

  year={2023},
  volume={72},
  number={},
  pages={1-12},
  abstract={Applying semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods, such as pseudo labeling and consistency regularization, to rotating machinery fault diagnosis alleviates the difficulty of obtaining a large amount of labeled data in industrial practice. The low accuracy of teacher models initially trained with limited labeled samples, however, often affects the performance of pseudo-labeling methods. Besides, when the existing consistency regularization methods are applied to vibration signals, there is also the problem that the label information may be damaged due to the difficulty in interpreting the 1-D data augmentation (DA) tool. To address these obstacles, a novel two-stage hybrid SSL method based on grouped pseudo labeling and consistency regularization is developed to generalize mechanical fault diagnosis ability under limited labeled samples. In the first stage, inspired by the label coherence among samples at similar acquisition times, the proposed method fed signal samples with similar acquisition times into the teacher network in groups. Then, the obtained predicted labels are averaged, and a threshold evaluates the validity of the obtained averaged pseudo labels. In the second stage, mixed labeled and remaining grouped unlabeled samples are fed into the student model for supervised and consistency regularization training. In addition, compared with traditional consistency regularization algorithms using mean square error (MSE) metric to estimate label information consistency between the original and related augmented samples, the trace of the covariance matrix is introduced to realize estimating the label information consistency among multiple unlabeled samples in a group. Experiments verify that the proposed hybrid SSL method steadily improves the fault diagnosis accuracy of two gearboxes with fewer labeled samples to nearly 100%.},

To enhance the target detection accuracy with unlabeled data, an improved unbiased teacher model is proposed, where multi-channel enhanced data is used for teacher model training, and good pseudo-labeling labeled data via fusion non-maximum suppression module is obtained and employed for student model learning.

  abstract={Arrhythmia classification is crucial for identifying and preventing the potential risks associated with cardiovascular diseases. Currently., using deep learning for arrhythmia classification faces challenges of model complexity and deployment difficulty. To address this., We present a novel approach for classifying arrhythmias using knowledge distillation and 2D ECG images. In this study., the classification of the MIT-BIH dataset is performed according to AAMI criteria. Preprocessing., such as denoising., interception., and 2D grayscale image conversion., is first performed. Then., high-performance 2D-CNN models are pre-trained using 2D ECG images as the teacher model., and a lightweight 1D-CNN is constructed as the student model. Finally., we align raw and 2D ECG data., utilizing knowledge distillation to allow the student model to learn from the teacher model during the training process., thus enabling model compression. The final results show that the method significantly improves the performance of the student model in arrhythmia classification. For overall performance., when using Vgg16 as the teacher model., Acc and P+ improve by 1.62% and 6.64%., and Se is comparable. In addition., the F1-score values have been improved in all categories. The proposed method provides a feasible approach for low computational power device deployment for arrhythmia classification.},

  volume={33},

  pages={6832-6844},
  abstract={Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has promising potential for improving model performance using both labelled and unlabelled data. Since recovering 3D information from 2D images is an ill-posed problem, the current state-of-the-art methods of monocular 3D object detection (Mono3D) have relatively low precision and recall, making semi-supervised learning for Mono3D tasks challenging and understudied. In this work, we propose a unified and effective semi-supervised learning framework called Mix-Teaching that can be applied to most monocular 3D object detectors. Based on the idea of decomposition and recombination, unlabelled samples are firstly decomposed into collections of image patches with high-quality predictions and collections of background images containing no objects. The student model is then trained on the mixed images containing dense instances with high-quality pseudo-labels generated by the recombination operation. In addition, we propose an uncertainty-based filter to distinguish high-quality pseudo-labels from noisy predictions during the decomposition process. As results in KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks, Mix-Teaching consistently improves MonoFlex and GUPNet by significant margins under various labeling ratios. Our method achieves around +6.34%  $AP_{3D}$  improvement against the GUPNet on the validation set when using only 10% labelled data. Using the full training set and the additional 38K raw images from KITTI, it can further improve the MonoFlex by +4.65% absolute improvement on  $AP_{3D}$  for car detection, reaching 18.54%  $AP_{3D}$ , which ranks the 1st place among all monocular based methods on the KITTI test leaderboard.},

In this paper, a workshop digital twin model construction method based on group systems cognition (GS C) is proposed, aiming to realize the overall cognition of workshop production process in multiple layers from low-level physical subsystem to high-level group systems. Combining digital twin technology with the general cognitive principles of human problem solving in cognitive science, a workshop digital twin model framework including physical layer, virtual layer and cognitive layer is established; then, a multi-level cognitive computing model with sustainable learning capability was constructed by using information technology, so that the workshop twin model has cognitive capability.

  abstract={The purpose of this work is the implementation of Virtual Reality (VR) and a Digital Twin (DT) of a Flexible Manufacturing Cell (FMC) to develop hard competences within the Industrial Robotics (IR) field. In this work, Robo DK (RDK) was used along with SolidWorks (SW) as a CAD software. The DT is made by placing all FMC 3D models in RDK. An industrial process is programmed into a VR DT environment for safe interaction and error detection. After the process is validated in VR, the students replicate it in the physical FMC. VR also allowed for interaction with different types of industrial robots. It is concluded from the results that the use of VR and a FMC DT allows for the students to have a safer, more organized and extensive experience with industrial robots; and therefore, they tend to propose solutions that improve quality, productivity, and efficiency in industrial processes.},

  abstract={Automated multi-label chest X-rays (CXR) image classification has achieved substantial progress in clinical diagnosis via utilizing sophisticated deep learning approaches. However, most deep models have high computational demands, which makes them less feasible for compact devices with low computational requirements. To overcome this problem, we propose a knowledge distillation (KD) strategy to create the compact deep learning model for the real-time multi-label CXR image classification. We study different alternatives of CNNs and Transforms as the teacher to distill the knowledge to a smaller student. Then, we employed explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to provide the visual explanation for the model decision improved by the KD. Our results on three benchmark CXR datasets show that our KD strategy provides the improved performance on the compact student model, thus being the feasible choice for many limited hardware platforms. For instance, when using DenseNet161 as the teacher network, EEEA-Net-C2 achieved an AUC of 83.7%, 87.1%, and 88.7% on the ChestX-ray14, CheXpert, and PadChest datasets, respectively, with fewer parameters of 4.7 million and computational cost of 0.3 billion FLOPS.},

  pages={5122-5133},
  abstract={Time series data generated by continuous glucose monitoring sensors offer unparalleled opportunities for developing data-driven approaches, especially deep learning-based models, in diabetes management. Although these approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various fields such as glucose prediction in type 1 diabetes (T1D), challenges remain in the acquisition of large-scale individual data for personalized modeling due to the elevated cost of clinical trials and data privacy regulations. In this work, we introduce GluGAN, a framework specifically designed for generating personalized glucose time series based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Employing recurrent neural network (RNN) modules, the proposed framework uses a combination of unsupervised and supervised training to learn temporal dynamics in latent spaces. Aiming to assess the quality of synthetic data, we apply clinical metrics, distance scores, and discriminative and predictive scores computed by post-hoc RNNs in evaluation. Across three clinical datasets with 47 T1D subjects (including one publicly available and two proprietary datasets), GluGAN achieved better performance for all the considered metrics when compared with four baseline GAN models. The performance of data augmentation is evaluated by three machine learning-based glucose predictors. Using the training sets augmented by GluGAN significantly reduced the root mean square error for the predictors over 30 and 60-minute horizons. The results suggest that GluGAN is an effective method in generating high-quality synthetic glucose time series and has the potential to be used for evaluating the effectiveness of automated insulin delivery algorithms and as a digital twin to substitute for pre-clinical trials.},

  abstract={Multirobot system for manufacturing is an Industry Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm with significant operational cost savings and productivity improvement, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed to control and implement collaborative productions without human intervention. This mission-critical system relies on 3-dimension (3-D) scene recognition to improve operation accuracy in the production line and autonomous piloting. However, implementing 3-D point cloud learning, such as Pointnet, is challenging due to limited sensing and computing resources equipped with UAVs. Therefore, we propose a digital twin (DT) empowered knowledge distillation (KD) method to generate several lightweight learning models and select the optimal model to deploy on UAVs. With a digital replica of the UAVs preserved at the edge server, the DT system controls the model-sharing network topology and learning model structure to improve recognition accuracy further. Moreover, we employ network calculus to formulate and solve the model sharing configuration problem toward minimal resource consumption, as well as convergence. Simulation experiments are conducted over a popular point cloud data set to evaluate the proposed scheme. Experiment results show that the proposed model-sharing scheme outperforms the individual model in terms of computing resource consumption and recognition accuracy.},

  abstract={Multi-teacher knowledge distillation can improve the performance of student networks in semi-supervised node classification tasks, but existing works ignore the importance of different teachers, using average of multiple teachers as final prediction. In addition, they rely on a large amount of labeled data, which is inconsistent with semi-supervised learning requirements. To solve these limitations, we propose a Neighborhood Correction Weight-Adaptive Multi-teacher Knowledge Distillation (NC-WAMKD) framework, which involves the knowledge distillation strategy WAMKD and the student model with Neighborhood Correction Label Propagation and Feature Transformation (NCLF). Specifically, WAMKD is designed to adaptively assign weights for multiple teachers to avoid misleading student by low-quality teachers. NCLF relies on neighborhood correction label propagation and feature transformation to validly predict unlabeled nodes. Experiments on semi-supervised node classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Code is available: https://github.com/para-99/NC-WAMKD.},

  abstract={Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers the knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to promote a smaller student model. Existing efforts guide the distillation by matching their prediction logits, feature embedding, etc., while leaving how to efficiently utilize them in junction less explored. In this paper, we propose Hint-dynamic Knowledge Distillation, dubbed HKD, which excavates the knowledge from the teacher’s hints in a dynamic scheme. The guidance effect from the knowledge hints usually varies in different instances and learning stages, which motivates us to customize a specific hint-learning manner for each instance adaptively. Specifically, a meta-weight network is introduced to generate the instance-wise weight coefficients about knowledge hints in the perception of the dynamical learning progress of the student model. We further present a weight ensembling strategy to eliminate the potential bias of coefficient estimation by exploiting the historical statics. Experiments on standard benchmarks of CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet manifest that the proposed HKD well boost the effect of knowledge distillation tasks.},

  abstract={Task-oriented dialogue systems have become overwhelmingly popular in recent researches. Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is widely used to extract the semantics frame of user queries and comprehend users’ intent/emotion/dialogue state in task-oriented dialogue systems. Most previous works on such discriminative tasks only model current query or historical conversations. Even if the entire conversation flow is modeled in some work, it is not suitable for real-world task-oriented dialogue systems, where future contexts are not visible until a response is given based on the current dialogue state. In this paper, we propose to jointly model historical and future information using knowledge distillation methods to address the discrepancy between offline and online information in dialogue understanding. More specifically, by modeling the current utterance and past contexts as student, and the entire dialogue flow as teacher, we optimize the "distance" between these two networks to regularize our student model in both online and offline ways. Our experiments on two dialogue datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving superior results compared with all baseline models.},

  abstract={Feature-map based knowledge distillation has exhibited its significance in improving the performance of student model. Existing works mainly focus on the formulation of knowledge, but ignore the number difference of channels due to heterogeneous architectures of teacher-student pair. They generally adopt handcrafted matching or input-independent association matrix, which would lead to the semantic mismatch, thus suboptimal performance. To resolve this problem, we present an input-dependent channel association module. This module automatically generates an allocation matrix in a cross-attention manner, which enables each student channel to be dynamically connected to its semantic-related teacher channel based on its learning state. An alternative training scheme is applied for stable optimization. Extensive experiments on image classification with a variety of settings based on the popular network architectures well demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.},

  year={2023},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Self-supervised speech pre-training enables deep neural network models to capture meaningful and disentangled factors from raw waveform signals. The learned universal speech representations can then be used across numerous down-stream tasks. These representations, however, are sensitive to distribution shifts caused by environmental factors, such as noise and/or room reverberation. Their large sizes, in turn, make them unfeasible for edge applications. In this work, we propose a knowledge distillation methodology termed RobustDistiller which compresses universal representations while making them more robust against environmental artifacts via a multi-task learning objective. The proposed layer-wise distillation recipe is evaluated on top of three well-established universal representations, as well as with three downstream tasks. Experimental results show the proposed methodology applied on top of the WavLM Base+ teacher model outperforming all other benchmarks across noise types and levels, as well as reverberation times. Oftentimes, the obtained results with the student model (24M parameters) achieved results inline with those of the teacher model (95M).},

  abstract={Prompt-based learning has improved the few-shot learning performance of large-scale Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Yet, it is challenging to deploy large-scale PLMs in resource-constrained environments for online applications. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a promising approach for PLM compression. However, distilling prompt-tuned PLMs in the few-shot learning setting is a non-trivial problem due to the lack of task-specific training data and KD techniques for the new prompting paradigm. We propose Prompt-Distiller, the first few-shot KD algorithm for prompt-tuned PLMs, which forces the student model to learn from both its pre-trained and prompt-tuned teacher models to alleviate the model overfitting problem. We further design a contrastive learning technique to learn higher-order dependencies from intermediate-layer representations of teacher models, considering different knowledge capacities of teacher and student models. Extensive experiments over various datasets show that Prompt-Distiller consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin.},

  abstract={This work studies knowledge distillation (KD) and addresses its constraints for recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) models. In hard distillation, a teacher model transcribes large amounts of unlabelled speech to train a student model. Soft distillation is another popular KD method that distills the output logits of the teacher model. Due to the nature of RNN-T alignments, applying soft distillation between RNNT architectures having different posterior distributions is challenging. In addition, bad teachers having high word-error-rate (WER) reduce the efficacy of KD. We investigate how to effectively distill knowledge from variable quality ASR teachers, which has not been studied before to the best of our knowledge. We show that a sequence-level KD, full-sum distillation, outperforms other distillation methods for RNN-T models, especially for bad teachers. We also propose a variant of full-sum distillation that distills the sequence discriminative knowledge of the teacher leading to further improvement in WER. We conduct experiments on public datasets namely SpeechStew and LibriSpeech, and on in-house production data.},

  abstract={Fall accidents are critical issues in an aging and aged society. Recently, many researchers developed "pre-impact fall detection systems" using deep learning to support wearable-based fall protection systems for preventing severe injuries. However, most works only employed simple neural network models instead of complex models considering the usability in resource-constrained mobile devices and strict latency requirements. In this work, we propose a novel pre-impact fall detection via CNN-ViT knowledge distillation, namely PreFallKD, to strike a balance between detection performance and computational complexity. The proposed PreFallKD transfers the detection knowledge from the pre-trained teacher model (vision transformer) to the student model (lightweight convolutional neural networks). Additionally, we apply data augmentation techniques to tackle issues of data imbalance. We conduct the experiment on the KFall public dataset and compare PreFallKD with other state-of-the-art models. The experiment results show that PreFallKD could boost the student model during the testing phase and achieves reliable F1-score (92.66%) and lead time (551.3 ms).},

Specifically, we compared using soft and hard target distillation to train large-scale RNN-T models on the LibriSpeech/LibriLight public dataset (60k hours) and our in-house data (600k hours). We found that hard targets are more effective when the teacher and student have different architecture, such as large teacher and small streaming student. On the other hand, soft target distillation works better in self-training scenario like iterative large teacher training. For a large model with 0.6B weights, we achieve a new SoTA word error rate (WER) on LibriSpeech (8% relative improvement on dev-other) using Noisy Student Training with soft target distillation. It also allows our production teacher to adapt new data domain continuously.},

  abstract={As an important work in computer vision, some recent representative works such as Two-stream networks, 3D ConvNets, and Transformer-based networks have achieved outstanding performance. However, due to the high computational cost, the explosion of computation time and parameters, they cannot meet the needs of real-time applications. The current work utilizes the keyframes, residual and motion information retained by compressed video for computation, which greatly reduces the computational effort but still cannot satisfy real-time applications. Therefore, we propose a multi-teacher fusion distillation framework for compressed video action recognition (MTFD). Unlike the traditional method of transferring the knowledge of single or multiple teachers directly into the student model, we also perform knowledge transfer between teachers. MTFD achieves better knowledge distillation through mutual guidance and information fusion between teachers. Furthermore, we improve the network’s ability to extract motion information, which ultimately reduces the computational effort while maintaining high accuracy.},

  abstract={The accurate segmentation of the right and left ventricles with limited labeled data is a challenging task in echocardiographic data analysis. To fully leverage the easily accessible unlabeled data, we propose a label-decoupling teacher-student framework (LDTSF) based on semi-supervised learning. Specifically, the decoupled deep network within LDTSF jointly predicts pixel-wise segmentation maps, level set-based edge regression maps, target skeleton maps and target detail maps to focus on edge pixels. Several micro-task-transformable layers are used to map multi-task representations to a unified space in order to supervise the consistency among multiple tasks using massive unlabeled data. In addition, we first train a teacher model based on semi-supervised learning strategy, and then use the pseudo-labels generated by the teacher model together with the original labels to train a student model. Experiments on our self-collected 3D echocardiographic dataset and a publicly available MRI dataset show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods.

  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD) is a machine learning technique widely used in recent years for the task of domain adaptation and complexity reduction. It relies on a Student-Teacher mechanism to transfer the knowledge of a large and complex Teacher network into a smaller Student model. Given the inherent complexity of large Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, and the need for deployment on edge devices with limited resources, complexity reduction techniques have become a hot topic in the Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) community. Recent literature in NILM has devoted increased effort to domain adaptation and architecture reduction via KD. However, the mechanism behind the transfer of knowledge from the Teacher to the Student is not clearly understood. In this work, we aim to address the aforementioned issue by placing the KD NILM approach in a framework of explainable AI (XAI). We identify the main inconsistency in the transfer of explainable knowledge, and exploit this information to propose a method for improvement of KD through explainability guided learning. We evaluate our approach on a variety of appliances and domain adaptation scenarios and demonstrate that solving inconsistencies in the transfer of explainable knowledge can lead to improvement in predictive performance.},

  abstract={Gun violence and misuse pose great threat to the public safety. Real-time monitoring of gun usage and gunshot events are very promising for effective gun control.

Addressing the limited resources of the embedded systems, we further propose an efficient gunshot recognition algorithm EfficientNetTime that combines the lightweight neural network and knowledge distillation, so as to enable the deployment on embedded devices. First, a novel lightweight deep learning model is proposed as the basic model, which combines the advantages of 1-D convolution and depthwise separable convolution to effectively characterize the gunshot signal while decreasing the computing cost of convolution. Second, using the knowledge distillation, EfficientNetTime is used as the teacher model to generate a compressed student model that maintains accuracy and greatly reducing model size. Finally, the EfficientNetTime student model can be deployed on resource-limited embedded systems. The proposed method can automatically extract features for end-to-end recognition and is robust to temporal transformations of input signals. Using a publicly available gunshot data set, the proposed EfficientNetTime model is verified and compared against the state-of-the-art models. Experimental results demonstrate that the EfficientNetTime model surpasses other gunshot recognition methods in terms of the accuracy and model size.},

  abstract={Objective: The behavior monitoring of older adults in their own home and enabling daily-life activity analysis to healthcare practitioner is a key challenge. Methods and procedures: Our framework replicates the elderly home in digital space which can provide an unobtrusive way to monitor the resident&ahat;s daily life activities. The learning challenges posed by different performed activities at home are solved by introducing the deep meta-class sequence model. The notion is to group the set of activities into a single meta-class according to the nature of the activities. It helps the learning process, which is based on long short-term memory (LSTM) to learn feature space abstraction. Each meta-class abstraction is further decomposed to an individual activity performed by the elderly at home. Results: The experiments are carried out over the Center for Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems dataset and proposed model outperforms as compared to baseline models. Clinical impact: Our findings demonstrate a robust framework to digitally monitor the elderly behavior, which is beneficial for healthcare practitioners to understand the level of support the elderly needed to perform the daily tasks or potential risk of an emergency in their own homes.},

  abstract={Semi-supervised learning is becoming an effective solution in medical image segmentation because annotations are costly and tedious to acquire. Methods based on the teacher-student model use consistency regularization and uncertainty estimation and have shown good potential in dealing with limited annotated data. Nevertheless, the existing teacher-student model is seriously limited by the exponential moving average algorithm, which leads to the optimization trap. Moreover, the classic uncertainty estimation method calculates the global uncertainty for images but does not consider local region-level uncertainty, which is unsuitable for medical images with blurry regions. In this article, the Voxel Stability and Reliability Constraint (VSRC) model is proposed to address these issues. Specifically, the Voxel Stability Constraint (VSC) strategy is introduced to optimize parameters and exchange effective knowledge between two independent initialized models, which can break through the performance bottleneck and avoid model collapse. Moreover, a new uncertainty estimation strategy, the Voxel Reliability Constraint (VRC), is proposed for use in our semi-supervised model to consider the uncertainty at the local region level. We further extend our model to auxiliary tasks and propose a task-level consistency regularization with uncertainty estimation. Extensive experiments on two 3D medical image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods under limited supervision.},

  abstract={Personalization is one of the primary emerging trends in Industry 4.0 and Beyond. Highly personalized services will present a significant challenge to the existing algorithms for network slicing (NS) and resource allocation, leading to issues, such as nonequilibratory resource allocation, in which some services are sacrificed for the maximum total reward of the algorithm, excessive cost, and slow algorithm convergence. A digital twin network (DTN) is offered as a novel solution to the challenges listed above. By integrating the DTN and IIoT NS, we propose a DTN-assisted industry Internet of Things NS (DTN-IIoT NS) architecture for personalized IIoT services in Industry 4.0 and Beyond. The DTN-IIoT NS architecture consists of three layers, three modules, and two closed loops. On the basis of the aforementioned architecture, we focus on the resource allocation process in DTN-IIoT NS, model the DT-assisted resource allocation for highly personalized IIoT services, propose the service equilibrium rate, and formulate the optimization problem aiming at maximizing the equilibrium rate weighted net profit of network providers. Then, we propose a dual-channel weighted (DCW) Critic network for service equilibrium in DTN-IIoT NS resource allocation and the matching Improved prioritized experience replay (PER) to enhance convergent speed. In addition, we present a distributed DT-assisted DCW-PER multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (PER-DCW MADDPG) algorithm for the resource allocation process in DTN-IIoT NS. Simulation results indicate that the PER-DCW MADDPG algorithm can produce a better service equilibrium and accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm.},

  abstract={In this Internet of Things (IoT) era, the number of devices capable of sensing their surroundings is increasing day by day. Based on the data from these devices, numerous services and systems are now offered where critical decisions depend on the data collected by sensors. Therefore, error-free data are most desirable, but due to extreme operating environments, the possibility of faults occurring in sensors is high. So, detecting faults in data obtained by sensors is important. In this article, a digital twin (DT)-inspired detection approach is proposed, and its ability to detect a single type of fault in several sensors is analyzed. The digital equivalent of the sensor is developed using a generative adversarial network (GAN). As GANs inherently perform well with images, Gramian angular field (GAF) encoding is used to convert time series data to images. The GAF encoding preserves the temporal relations of the time series data. The GAN is trained with the GAF images. The trained GAN model acts as the virtual representation of the sensor, and the discriminator network of the GAN model, once it has learned the pattern of normal data, is used as the fault detector. The performance of the virtual sensor is promising because it successfully generates data for normal conditions. The best fault detection accuracy achieved by the proposed model is 98.7%, which makes this GAN-based DT-inspired approach a promising candidate for sensor fault detection.},

  abstract={In this letter, we investigate an edge computing-assisted Metaverse system. This system involves a virtual service provider (VSP), which can partially offload sensing data collected from UAVs to an edge computing platform. The data is used to update its digital twins (DTs) to ensure the promptness of Metaverse services and satisfy the latency requirements of Metaverse users. However, designing such a system is challenging due to the dynamics of sensing data, the latency requirements of Metaverse users, channel conditions, and the available computing resources at both the VSP and EC. Therefore, we formulate the VSP’s offloading problem as a stochastic problem and utilize deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the learning algorithms.},

  abstract={Limited by battery and computing resources, the computing-intensive tasks generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices cannot be processed all by themselves. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a suitable solution for this problem, and the generated tasks can be offloaded from IoT devices to MEC. In this paper, we study the problem of dynamic task offloading for digital twin-empowered MEC. Digital twin techniques are applied to provide information of environment and share the training data of agent deployed on IoT devices. We formulate the task offloading problem with the goal of maximizing the energy efficiency and the workload balance among the ESs. Then, we reformulate the problem as an MDP problem and design DRL-based energy efficient task offloading (DEETO) algorithm to solve it. Comparative experiments are carried out which show the superiority of our DEETO algorithm in improving energy efficiency and balancing the workload.},

  abstract={This review article provides an overview of the potential of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to revolutionize industrial automation. The IIoT is the Internet of Things (IoT) but in an industrial context, i.e., IIoT is used more to connect machines and devices in industrial environments. The IIoT has the potential to benefit from advances in artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning and deep learning, to increase efficiency and productivity and reduce overhead costs. We provide an overview of the supervisory control and data acquisition system, a definition of IIoT, and how IIoT can offer industry greater potential for system integration to improve automation and optimization. In addition, five of the major IIoT protocols are discussed, namely, message queue telemetry transport, advanced messaging queuing protocol, constrained application protocol, data distribution service, and open platform communication unified architecture. We then identified key IIoT improvements for industrial automation. These are; efficient and low-cost systems, digital twin, machine failure prediction, real-time remote monitoring, and security. We then discussed the key research in the literature for each category. We presented some public IIoT datasets so that researchers can use them to develop new learning models to improve the security of IIoT systems. Finally, we discussed some of the limitations, recommendations, and future perspectives for developing IIoT-enabled systems.},
