  abstract={The photogrammetry system has been widely used in industrial manufacturing applications, such as high-precision assembly, reverse engineering and additive manufacturing. In order to meet the demand of the product variety and short product lifecycle, the factory facilities including photogrammetry devices, should be relocated in response to rapid change in mechanical structure and hardware integration. Nevertheless, the camera position of the photogrammetry system is difficult to select to guarantee an optimal field of view (FoV) coverage of retro-reflective targets during the whole production horizon. Especially in a reconfigurable manufacturing work cell, scaling and calibration of a photogrammetry system requires professional skills and these would cost tremendous labour for rapid configuration each time. In this paper, we propose a novel deep optimisation framework for the photogrammetry camera position for the dynamic layout design based on digital twin. The optimisation framework follows an effective coarse-to-fine procedure to evaluate the FoV visibility over the target frame. In addition, the deep Q-learning algorithm is utilised to find the maximum FoV coverage and avoid collision. Three experiments are implemented to verify the application feasibility of the proposed deep camera position optimisation framework. Note to Practitioners—Large-volume in-process metrology is an essential element in flexible manufacturing systems. Quality of large-volume measurement relies heavily on target visibility within its field of view. In a compact industrial robotic cell, this is extremely challenging as the robot would take the primary position and causing view blockage throughout its operation. This makes the simultaneous monitoring of robot head and the work piece key feature extremely difficult. Manual trial-and-error positioning approach is lengthy and requires high level of expertise, due to both safety and spatial concerns. We approached this problem by simulating the camera’s view in a digital twin environment and maximising the target visibility throughout the full operation cycle. The generic framework can provide guidance in metrology setup within automated manufacturing environment, accelerate the system commissioning time, remove dependency of skill level and expand the capability for flexible/reconfigurable manufacturing systems. Although V-STARS camera are used in this application, the framework can be applied for other types of vision systems that requires field of view.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a high-performance and light-weight deep learning model for Remote Sensing Image Classification (RSIC), the task of identifying the aerial scene of a remote sensing image. To this end, we first evaluate various benchmark convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: MobileNet V1/V2, ResNet 50/151V2, InceptionV3/InceptionResNetV2, EfficientNet B0/B7, DenseNet 121/201, ConNeXt Tiny/Large. Then, the best performing models are selected to train a compact model in a teacher-student arrangement. The knowledge distillation from the teacher aims to achieve high performance with significantly reduced complexity. By conducting extensive experiments on the NWPU-RESISC45 benchmark, our proposed teacher and student models outper-forms the state-of-the-art systems, and has potential to be applied on a wide range of edge devices.},

  abstract={Three-dimensional (3D) building models play a crucial role in shaping digital twin cities and enabling a wide range of urban applications. However, one challenge remains in obtaining a compact representation of buildings from remote sensing. This paper introduces a novel deep learning approach to reconstructing polygonal building models from LiDAR point clouds. Our method leverages a graph neural network to assemble the polyhedra generated through space partitioning, thereby formulating building surface reconstruction as a graph node classification problem. To facilitate network training, we construct a synthetic dataset by simulating aerial LiDAR point clouds on building surface meshes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a polyhedral classification accuracy of 96.4%. Moreover, our approach offers high efficiency and interpretability through end-to-end optimization.},

  pages={5026-5028},
  abstract={In real-world recognition of remote sensing (RS) targets, large amount of RS data is hard to be acquired at once, but arrives in batches, which means the constantly adaption of models for new data and new classes. However, training old and new data together from scratch has certain requirements on data storage space and retraining time, so incremental learning come to be desirable for future RS recognition systems. In this article, a class incremental learning method based on knowledge distillation is proposed for RS image classification. In order to better retain the knowledge of old tasks, a relation-based loss is used as a new matching manner in distillation loss, which frees the student model from the burden of matching the exact output of the teacher model. Experiment results based on UC Merced 21, NWPU-RESISC45 and plane objects of FAIR1M demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Existing research in semantic segmentation heavily relies on numerous manually annotated data, while the vast amount of unlabeled data still needs to be fully utilized. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel multi-stage semi-supervised method for remote sensing semantic segmentation, building upon a modified classical self-training scheme that leverages pseudo-labels. By dividing the data augmentation process into two stages, we employ various data augmentation strategies and balance the size of labels and pseudo-labels validated through rigorous experimentation, which can alleviate the student model from overfitting pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we also explore the efficacy of the Vision Transformer model in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, leading to further performance enhancements. The experimental results show that our semi-supervised remote sensing semantic segmentation method exhibits a more intuitive structure, easier deployment, and superior performance.},

  abstract={Commonly adopted in the manufacturing and aerospace sectors, digital twin (DT) platforms are increasingly seen as a promising paradigm to control and monitor software-based, “open”, communication systems, which play the role of the physical twin (PT). In the general framework presented in this work, the DT builds a Bayesian model of the communication system, which is leveraged to enable core DT functionalities such as control via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and monitoring of the PT for anomaly detection. We specifically investigate the application of the proposed framework to a simple case-study system encompassing multiple sensing devices that report to a common receiver. The Bayesian model trained at the DT has the key advantage of capturing epistemic uncertainty regarding the communication system, e.g., regarding current traffic conditions, which arise from limited PT-to-DT data transfer. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian framework as compared to standard frequentist model-based solutions.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={316-322},
  abstract={Real-time Digital Twinning of physical world scenes onto the Metaverse is necessary for a myriad of applications such as augmented-reality (AR) assisted driving. In AR assisted driving, physical environment scenes are first captured by Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) and are uploaded to the Metaverse. A central Metaverse Map Service Provider (MMSP) will aggregate information from all IoVs to develop a central Metaverse Map. Information from the Metaverse Map can then be downloaded into individual IoVs on demand and be delivered as AR scenes to the driver. However, the growing interest in developing AR assisted driving applications which relies on digital twinning invites adversaries. These adversaries may place physical adversarial patches on physical world objects such as cars, signboards, or on roads, seeking to contort the virtual world digital twin. Hence, there is a need to detect these physical world adversarial patches. Nevertheless, as real-time, accurate detection of adversarial patches is compute-intensive, these physical world scenes have to be offloaded to the Metaverse Map Base Stations (MMBS) for computation. Hence in our work, we considered an environment with moving Internet of Vehicles (IoV), uploading real-time physical world scenes to the MMBSs. We formulated a realistic joint variable optimization problem where the MMSPs' objective is to maximize adversarial patch detection mean average precision (mAP), while minimizing the computed AR scene up-link transmission latency and IoVs' up-link transmission idle count, through optimizing the IoV-MMBS allocation and IoV up-link scene resolution selection. We proposed a Heterogeneous Action Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO) (discrete-continuous) algorithm to tackle the proposed problem. Extensive experiments shows HAPPO outperforms baseline models when compared against key metrics.},

  abstract={In this paper, we study the abnormal behaviors detection and the corresponding data poisoning attacks in digital twin (DT)-based networks. We first analyze the abnormal behaviors existing in the DT-based networks, including environment anomalies, hardware and software faults, and network attacks. Specially, we design a machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detector to identify network attacks. Furthermore, due to the strong dependency of ML models on training data, in which the outputs of the trained ML models can be affected by the poisoned samples. We design a data poisoning attack scheme against the proposed ML-based anomaly detector, in which attackers can effectively compromise the output of anomaly detectors. Extensive experimental results adopting three commonly used ML-based models demonstrate that the attack can compromise these detectors with over 80% probability.},

  pages={447-452},
  abstract={Digital Twin Network (DTN) constructs a many-to-many mapping network by communicating and collaborating with massive Digital Twins (DTs), which can better assist the management and operation of large-scale modern systems. However, the emergence of DTN mirrors a growing demand for bulk data transfer between geo-distributed DT nodes in the physical network infrastructure. Conventional end-to-end connections are facing a great challenge in the presence of the background traffic fluctuation. In this paper, we propose a graph convolutional network (GCN)-enabled scheduling method to schedule bulk data transfers across the DTN in a store-and-forward (SnF) manner. Instead of solving the complex SnF scheduling problem on the entire network, the proposed method decomposes the problem into multiple sub-problems on different pre-computed routes. Instead of learning the scheduling results directly, the GCN model is used to predict the reachability of DT nodes. These unreachable nodes will be excluded from the scheduling process. Our studies show that the proposed method obtains better network performance and lower complexity when compared with the conventional scheduling methods.},

  abstract={Digital twin has been emerging as a promising paradigm that connects the physical entities and digital space, and continuously evolves and optimizes the physical systems. In this paper, we focus on studying the efficient data communication and computation when constructing the marine digital twin network with secrecy provisioning. Specifically, we leverage the federated learning (FL) to train the digital twin model. In the process of FL, all unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) deliver the trained models with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to the high altitude platform (HAP) for the global model aggregation. Considering the possible eavesdropping on the HAP, we utilize the chaotic sequences to spread the model information during the global model broadcasting. In this framework, we further want to minimize the total energy consumption of completing the digital twin training by jointly optimizing the global accuracy, local accuracy, HAP's transmission power, and model uploading duration subject to the secrecy provisioning and latency constraint. Despite the non-convexity, we propose a low-complexity search algorithm (LCS-Algorithm) to solve this joint optimization problem. Finally, the numerical results validate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of optimality and time efficiency.},

  abstract={Recently, Google proposed a privacy-preserving framework, Federated Learning (FL), to realize the era of edge intelligence. However, the limited labeled data that can only be labeled by the data owner with domain know-how threatens the feasibility of FL. In fact, Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) is a key to leveraging the unlabeled data on the client side while the confirmation bias issue triggered by incorrect predictions in the old-fashion Teacher-Student structure drops the model accuracy significantly. In this paper, we introduce the state-of-the-art SSL technique called Meta Pseudo Labels (MPL), which advocates a feedback strategy in the Teacher-Student architecture to mitigate the performance degradation. Unfortunately, in FL the heterogeneous data without sharing among clients are non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). The knowledge that shuttles between the Teacher and Student model may be partial and undermine the effectiveness of MPL. To make a performance breakthrough, we proposed a novel FL framework called Federated Meta Learning with Synergetic Strategy (SynFMPL), which combines the advantages of both Teacher and Student models. To our best knowledge, we are the first work that integrates MPL technique in FL. Moreover, we specifically focus on the client side, which fully leverages the unlabeled data for model generalization. The experiment shows that SynFPML outperforms all baselines in various non-IID scenarios. The Student model in SynFMPL even exceeds the upper bound in all baselines by 4% and maintains a virtuous cycle in the learning process.},

  pages={435-440},
  abstract={Practical deployments of Machine-Learning(ML)-based solutions for failure management in optical networks often suffer from limited data availability, due to, especially, scarcity of labelled data describing different failure scenarios. Transfer Learning (TL) is regarded as a promising direction in cases of data scarcity, thanks to its ability to transfer knowledge from a Source Domain (SD) (e.g. SD could be a digital twin or a laboratory testbed) to a Target Domain (TD) (e.g., the infield network). In this paper, we focus on cross-lightpath and cross-task application of TL for failure localization and failure detection in optical networks. We found that, depending on the number of retrained parameters in the ML model, cross-lightpath TL for failure localization provides satisfactory accuracy (higher than 90%, in some cases) with limited amounts of TD data, and is also convenient in terms of TD retraining duration with respect to cases where TL is not used. Moreover, we found that cross-task failure detection/localization reaches up to 12% or 25% improvement in TD accuracy when considering failure localization and detection as TD task, respectively.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose a digital twin (DT)-assisted cloud-edge collaborative transcoding scheme to enhance user satisfaction in live streaming. We first present a DT-assisted transcoding workload estimation (TWE) model for the cloud-edge collaborative transcoding. Particularly, two DTs are constructed for emulating the cloud-edge collaborative transcoding process by analyzing spatial-temporal information of individual videos and transcoding configurations of transcoding queues, respectively. Two light-weight Bayesian neural networks are adopted to fit the TWE models in DTs, respectively. Moreover, we formulate a transcoding-path selection problem to maximize long-term user satisfaction within an average service delay threshold, taking the dynamics of video arrivals and video requests into account. The problem is transformed into a standard Markov decision process by using the Lyapunov optimization, which is further solved by a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation results based on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively enhance user satisfaction compared with benchmark schemes.},

  abstract={The satellite-ground (SG) integrated networks are regarded as a promising network structure, which can provide ubiquitous intelligence and pervasive services for multiple ground users. Moreover, digital twin (DT) can drive real-time data mapping and wireless access from usual physical utilities to digital units. Therefore, the fusion of SG and DT can decrease the gap between real-time data analysis and physical system states, which can help boost SG-DT edge intelligence paradigms. Nevertheless, the unexpected task arrivals, time-varying channel gains, and distrust among ground devices cause the network service performance degradation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a privacy-assisted blockchain computation offloading model to shine upon original tasks to the corresponding aerial platforms, and then orchestrate the task scheduling, resource allocation, and privacy protection. Additionally, we envision a Lyapunov stability theory-based multi-agent federated reinforcement learning (LST-MAFRL) algorithm to further resolve the CPU cycle frequency, the size of each blockchain, the number of DTs, and related harvested solar energy to minimize the execution energy consumption and privacy time overhead. Finally, extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed LST-MAFRL algorithm framework outperforms some state-of-the-art benchmarks for the sake of execution energy efficiency, processed bit quantities, and privacy time overhead.},

  abstract={6G technology is expected to lead to an unpredictable increase of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The need for maintaining continuous connectivity of these devices has in turn led to re-thinking of the traditional design of wireless networks. In particular, the integration of 6G and Digital Twin (DT) is expected to reshape the network management as it offers powerful features in design, development and optimization processes. DT is a digital representation of physical entities, which are designed around a two-way information flow. Therefore, this technology not only collects data, and employs intelligent learning methods by performing complex computations, but it also can send feedback to improve system performance for 6G-enabled massive IoT. However, deploying such a technology requires addressing complex challenges such as limited resources, seamless connectivity and lack of trust between end users and network edge. To address these challenges, we formulate the resource allocation problem including edge computation and service migration in 6G-enabled massive IoT. The contributions are threefold: First, our DT-empowered architecture is proposed that uses the real-time and historical data from end users to find the best allocation at a user. Second, it studies the impact of trust relationship between computing entities to prevent the unauthorized accesses and provides an authentication procedure. Third, it describes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm that consists of cooperative agents and aims to find the best resource allocation strategy by minimizing task processing latency. We validate the proposed DT-empowered architecture to show the reduced processing latency compared to traditional benchmark methods.},

For this, we investigate an intelligent delay-sensitive task offloading scheme for the dynamic vehicular environment which provides computation resources via local execution, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and vehicle-to-infrastructure/RSU (V2I) offloading modes based on the energy consumption of the system. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation scheme in the DT (RADiT) of the IoV network for maximizing its utility while optimizing the strategy of task offloading. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with and without the presence of V2V computation mode and another benchmark, DRL algorithm called soft actor-critic (SAC).

  abstract={As an up-coming digitalization technology, the digital twin (DT) offers a viable implementation for dynamic perception and intelligent decision-making in the industrial IoT (IIoT). For synchronizing the real-time information between the device and its DT, communication is fundamental to the digital twin system. Federated learning (FL) based DT model framework could be seen as an emerging paradigm to avoid large communication loads and high data leakage. However, the current digital twin model constructed scheme based on FL is not suitable for the heterogeneous IIoT scenario. Due to the different data distribution and different tasks among the devices, it leads to severe performance degradation when the personalized requirements of the DT model are ignored. In this paper, we propose a DT model framework based on personalized federated learning (PFL) to perform well for individual devices. Considering the historical personalized knowledge forgetting problem, the personalized federated learning with self-knowledge distillation (DTPFLsd) algorithm is proposed to avoid severe performance degradation and unnecessary time consumption of DT modeling. The numerical results compare with state-of-the-art FL-based DT architecture called DTWN and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DTPFLsd scheme.},

  pages={36-41},
  abstract={Realizing the potential gains of large-scale MIMO systems requires the accurate estimation of their channels or the fine adjustment of their narrow beams. This, however, is typically associated with high channel acquisition/beam sweeping overhead that scales with the number of antennas. Machine and deep learning represent promising approaches to overcome these challenges thanks to their powerful ability to learn from prior observations and side information. Training machine and deep learning models, however, requires large-scale datasets that are expensive to collect in deployed systems. To address this challenge, we propose a novel direction that utilizes digital replicas of the physical world to reduce or even eliminate the MIMO channel acquisition overhead. In the proposed digital twin aided communication, 3D models that approximate the real-world communication environment are constructed and accurate ray-tracing is utilized to simulate the site-specific channels. These channels can then be used to aid various communication tasks. Further, we propose to use machine learning to approximate the digital replicas and reduce the ray tracing computational cost. To evaluate the proposed digital twin based approach, we conduct a case study focusing on the position-aided beam prediction task. The results show that a learning model trained solely with the data generated by the digital replica can achieve relatively good performance on real-world data. Moreover, a small number of real-world data points can quickly achieve near-optimal performance, overcoming the modeling mismatches between the physical and digital worlds and significantly reducing the data acquisition overhead.},

  abstract={Millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz MIMO systems rely on pre-defined beamforming codebooks for both initial access and data transmission. However, most of the existing codebooks adopt pre-defined beams that focus mainly on improving the gain of their target users, without taking interference into account, which could incur critical performance degradation in the dense networks. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a sample-efficient digital twin-assisted beam pattern design framework that learns how to form the beam pattern to reject the signals from the interfering directions. The proposed approach does not require any explicit channel knowledge or any coordination with the interferers. The adoption of the digital twin improves the sample efficiency by better leveraging the underlying signal relationship and by incorporating a demand-based data acquisition strategy. Simulation results show that the developed signal model-based learning framework can significantly reduce the actual interaction with the radio environment (i.e., number of measurements) compared to the model-unaware design, leading to a more practical and efficient interference-aware beam design approach.},

  abstract={6G is envisioned to serve many compute-intensive and latency-sensitive applications which are now usually formed by functional components in the directed acyclic graphic (DAG) form. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is proven a promising way to offload computing tasks and reduce execution latency. However, the ever-increasing number and heterogeneity of edge computing nodes, as well as the dynamically changing resource state, hinder any centralized scheduler from getting the accurate and timely resource state in the huge number of edge nodes. In this paper, facing a large-scale MEC scenario, we propose a digital twin (DT) assisted multiagent-based task scheduling scheme to jointly optimize task offloading and resource allocation strategy for DAG tasks. The scheme exploits the evolutionary selection multi-agent reinforcement learning (ES-MARL) framework to expedite the training of a large number of agents, while the DT of the mobile edge network keeps the latest state data and enables the centralized training of these distributed agents. The simulation result shows that the proposed scheme can achieve the goals of reducing latency and energy consumption while improving the scheduling success rate, load balancing index, and training efficiency.},

  abstract={Federated edge learning can be essential in supporting privacy-preserving, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled activities in digital twin 6G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, we need to also consider the potential of attacks targeting the underlying AI systems (e.g., adversaries seek to corrupt data on the IoT devices during local updates or corrupt the model updates); hence, in this article, we propose an anticipatory study for poisoning attacks in federated edge learning for digital twin 6G-enabled IoT environments. Specifically, we study the influence of adversaries on the training and development of federated learning models in digital twin 6G-enabled IoT environments. We demonstrate that attackers can carry out poisoning attacks in two different learning settings, namely: centralized learning and federated learning, and successful attacks can severely reduce the model's accuracy. We comprehensively evaluate the attacks on a new cyber security dataset designed for IoT applications with three deep neural networks under the non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data and the independent and identically distributed (IID) data. The poisoning attacks, on an attack classification problem, can lead to a decrease in accuracy from 94.93% to 85.98% with IID data and from 94.18% to 30.04% with Non-IID.},

  abstract={With the development of deep learning technology and the application of large-scale models, high training costs and a large number of model parameters have become bottlenecks that limit technological development. To address these issues, existing model distillation techniques can transfer knowledge from large models to small models, reducing the model size and computational resource consumption while maintaining high performance. However, existing research has overlooked the privacy protection of input data and large models during the distillation process. In practical scenarios, the entities who train student models and own teacher models may be different institutions or countries, and how to protect the privacy of training data and teacher models is a challenge facing cross-institutional distillation learning. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving model distillation method combining random masking and threshold encryption systems. We introduce noise based on random masking into training data and encrypt the output of the teacher model, ensuring the privacy of the input data and teacher model while ensuring the performance of the distilled student model. We rigorously prove the security and correctness of the scheme in theory and validate its effectiveness through experiments. The experimental results show that the student model trained after data protection has a similar classification performance to the student model in the original distillation learning.},

  pages={156-162},
  abstract={Most of the existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods mainly pursue improving the precision of human pose estimation, ignoring the model's complexity and making it impossible to deploy it on resource-constrained devices. In addition, some other methods overly pursue the model's lightweight, which significantly decreases the model's precision and affects the experience of practical applications. However, in reality, fast and accurate applications are often more popular, so this area of research is of some practical significance. To achieve lightweight deployment and better practical application, A lightweight human pose estimation model based on knowledge distillation is proposed, which firstly uses group convolution and channel shuffle operation to lighten the HRNet model to obtain the S-HRNet model. Secondly, a response-based knowledge distillation algorithm is proposed to use the pre-trained HRNet as the teacher model and S-HRNet as the student model with the help of an offline knowledge distillation strategy, and the prediction results of the teacher model are used to supervise the learning of the student model together with the real labels. Finally, this paper conducts a large number of experiments on the MS COCO dataset proposed by Microsoft, and the experimental results show that the model in this paper has a higher average precision and lower number of parameters and computations compared to the other models mentioned.},

  title={A Transformer-based Knowledge Distillation Network for Cortical Cataract Grading}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Cortical cataract, a common type of cataract, is particularly difficult to be diagnosed automatically due to the complex features of the lesions. Recently, many methods based on edge detection or deep learning were proposed for automatic cataract grading. However, these methods suffer a large performance drop in cortical cataract grading due to the more complex cortical opacities and uncertain data. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based Knowledge Distillation Network, called TKD-Net, for cortical cataract grading. To tackle the complex opacity problem, we first devise a zone decomposition strategy to extract more refined features and introduce special sub-scores to consider critical factors of clinical cortical opacity assessment (location, area, density) for comprehensive quantification. Next, we develop a multi-modal mix-attention Transformer to efficiently fuse sub-scores and image modality for complex feature learning. However, obtaining the sub-score modality is a challenge in the clinic, which could cause the modality missing problem instead. To simultaneously alleviate the issues of modality missing and uncertain data, we further design a Transformer-based knowledge distillation method, which uses a teacher model with perfect data to guide a student model with modality-missing and uncertain data. We conduct extensive experiments on a dataset of commonly-used slit-lamp images annotated by the LOCS III grading system to demonstrate that our TKD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, as well as the effectiveness of its key components.

  abstract={The rapid adoption of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and digital twins (DTs) technologies within industrial environments has highlighted diverse critical issues related to safety and security. Sensor failure is one of the major threats compromising DTs operations. In this article, for the first time, we address the problem of sensor fault detection, isolation, and accommodation (SFDIA) in large-size networked systems. Current available machine-learning solutions are either based on shallow networks unable to capture complex features from input graph data or on deep networks with overshooting complexity in the case of large number of sensors. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new framework for sensor validation based on a deep recurrent graph convolutional architecture which jointly learns a graph structure and models spatio-temporal interdependencies. More specifically, the proposed two-block architecture 1) constructs the virtual sensors in the first block to refurbish anomalous (i.e., faulty) behavior of unreliable sensors and to accommodate the isolated faulty sensors and 2) performs the detection and isolation tasks in the second block by means of a classifier. Extensive analysis on two publicly available datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed architecture over existing state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract={This paper introduces an innovative approach to enhance traffic anomaly detection in transportation systems using deep learning and knowledge distillation.

To address real-time anomaly detection challenges, we propose a novel lightweight neural network architecture inspired by EfficientNet-B0, designed for efficient video anomaly detection. Through knowledge distillation, a student model learns from a teacher model’s predictions, resulting in heightened anomaly detection accuracy. Experimental results highlight the approach’s efficacy, with the knowledge-distilled student model consistently outperforming the standalone lightweight network, achieving an accuracy of 94.83% compared to 94.16%. This research offers a practical solution for real-time traffic anomaly detection, which is especially valuable in resource-constrained environments. Fusing a unique dataset, EfficientNet-B0-like structure, lightweight architecture, and knowledge distillation holds significant potential for fostering safer and more efficient transportation systems.},

This method is based on a hybrid system for traffic short-term forecasting and anomaly detection developed through Data Analytics (DA) and a novel Machine Learning (ML) approach for Time Series Analysis (TSA) able to scale in large scenarios while keeping the promptness of DT environments. The proposed system was developed through the knowledge extracted by a set of real multi modal transportation datasets and demonstrates better performance against conventional techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMAX and VARMA. Finally, this work was integrated in a DT solution for the optimization of transportation and its commitment with Net Zero Targets in a use case for Transport Decarbonization.},

  abstract={Tasks, understood as educational instructions to transform an initial state to a targeted state in the learner model, are central elements in (computer science) education, irrespective of the mode of delivery – online or classic face-to-face teaching. They appear in different roles; as learning objects that help acquire competencies, as assessment instruments for measuring learning success, or for practicing specific skills. However, as with any educational technology, proper handling and well-planned selection are crucial for successful teaching. Correspondingly, the requirements that tasks have to fulfill are wide-ranging: they should promote specific learning outcomes, be appropriate to address desired cognitive dimensions, and be tailored to the student to keep motivation and learning success high. To enable an on-demand, outcome-oriented, and individualized selection of tasks in adaptive learning systems, we need to formalize tasks in all dimensions. A detailed review of different models for cognitive processes, knowledge dimensions in education, tasks, and errors leads to the Y-Model, a model for formalizing tasks (in computer science). It forms the basis for an individual, competence-oriented integration of tasks in educational systems. Finally, we present the first implementation of the model.},

  abstract={Digital twins for wide-areas (e.g., smart cities) would fulfill the 6G expectation of merging the physical and digital worlds, abbreviated as "DT-WA". It would incorporate an artificial intelligent (AI) model to simulate and predict the physical world, which needs a constant parameter updating process to keep its fidelity. However, the updating process can consume significant energy, where little work exits. This paper proposes an energy-efficient edge cooperation and data collection scheme. The AI model is partitioned into a large amount of sub-models onto different edge servers (ESs) co-located with access points to simulate every part of the wide-area, which are distributed updated using locally-collected data. To reduce system energy, ESs can choose to become either updating helpers or recipients of their neighboring ESs, based on their available sensors and basic updating convergences. Helpers share their updated parameters with their neighboring recipients to reduce the latter workload. To minimize system energy, the paper further proposes a distributed algorithm to adaptively optimize ESs cooperative identities, data collections and heterogenous resource allocations in the dynamic environment. It incorporates several constraint-release methods and a large-scale multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the updating energy in DT-WA compared with baselines.},

It is worth noting that the system primarily focuses on achieving an initial end-to-end implementation, rather than on the learning component. The proposed system uses shape features extracted by using an RGBD camera and calculated by Computer Vision (CV) techniques to enable the DT to interact with the virtual version of real objects. The system is divided into four phases: demonstration, learning, execution, and evaluation, and is tested using objects of increasing shape complexity. The primary challenges of accurately translating real interaction into virtual interaction, detecting shape features using CV techniques, and ensuring feasible actions are addressed. The potential applications of this project include hazardous materials handling, manufacturing automation, and other scenarios where robots must interact with objects in various settings.

  abstract={The Metaverse, a 3-dimensional virtual realm mirroring real-world objects, promises transformative experiences. Its potential is tempered by data collection, confidentiality, and privacy concerns. In tandem with AI-enabled technologies, edge computing can provide a practical solution to overcoming many of these challenges. This paper argues that combining AI-enabled technologies with edge computing-specifically via federated learning (FL) can address these challenges. FL, as a privacy-centric distributed machine learning (ML) approach, enables knowledge sharing among Metaverse clients without compromising user data. However, while FL posits potential resolutions for the Metaverse, a discernible lacuna remains in the comprehensive study of its overarching consequences. The literature misses an extensive study of adopting these new deployment architectures, giving it significant research impact. This paper bridges this knowledge gap, exploring the symbiosis between the Metaverse and FL. We first introduce the foundational concepts of both domains and detail enabling technologies such as digital twins, the Internet of Things, brain-computer interfaces, blockchain, and extended reality. Next, we delve into practical applications of FL within the metaverse, spanning sectors like healthcare, education, e-commerce, gaming, and the military. Finally, the paper highlights the key challenges and future directions for integrating FL within the metaverse ecosystem.},

  abstract={Collaborative edge computing (CEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm, enabling edge nodes to collaborate and execute microservices from end devices. Microservice offloading, a fundamentally important problem, decides when and where microservices are executed upon the arrival of services. However, the dynamic nature of the real-world CEC environment often leads to inefficient microservice offloading strategies, resulting in underutilized resources and network congestion. To address this challenge, we formulate an online joint microservice offloading and bandwidth allocation problem, JMOBA, to minimize the average completion time of services. In this paper, we introduce a novel microservice offloading algorithm, DTDRLMO, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and digital twin technology. Specifically, we employ digital twin techniques to predict and adapt to changing edge node loads and network conditions of CEC in real-time. Furthermore, this approach enables the generation of an efficient offloading plan, selecting the most suitable edge node for each microservice. Simulation results on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DTDRLMO outperforms heuristic and learning-based methods in average service completion time.},

  abstract={The significance of low-quality data in unlabeled medical images is always underestimated. We believe that these underestimated data contain valuable information that remains largely unexplored. We present a novel uncertainty-guided different levels of pseudo-labels (UDLP) framework to explore the underestimated data in medical images. The framework consists of a student-teacher model that uses uncertainty to classify the pseudo-labels predicted by the teacher model into three levels: high confidence, low confidence and unreliability. The student model learns directly from high-confidence pseudo-labels. By using the confident learning method in low-confidence pseudo-labels, the teacher model corrects the noisy labels in low-confidence voxels to provide positive feature information for the student model. We design a method for removing unreliable pseudo-labels, to further enhance model’s generalizability. The proposed framework UDLP is evaluated on two datasets and demonstrates superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Lidar is a typical sensor in the fields of autonomous driving, environment-aware robots, and industrial automation. The 3D point cloud data collected by it contains rich 3D spatial information, and the surface description of objects is also close to reality, which helps people perceive complex scenes. In recent years, the deep learning-based lidar 3D point cloud data processing method has received widespread attention, realizing automatic feature learning from large amounts of data and realizing target detection and semantic segmentation of complex scenes. Among them, most methods need to learn model parameters based on a large amount of labeled data. However, the annotation of 3D point cloud data is more time-consuming and laborious than that of 2D images. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a point cloud data labeling method based on the combination of semi-supervised learning and knowledge distillation. Firstly, the existing point cloud data is denoised by the improved three-dimensional guided filtering method to remove useless noise. Then, the classic Bilateral Augmentation and Adaptive Fusion (BAAF) point cloud semantic segmentation model is used as the teacher model. Moreover, to enhance the point cloud data, the local semantic context of the pyramid is introduced. We further generate high-quality pseudo-labels through the class range balance module. Finally, the rapid training of the student model is completed through the teacher averaging method in knowledge distillation and the obtained pseudo-labels. During the experiment, we discuss the labeling effect on the point cloud data of the public SemanticKITTI dataset and compare it with the scribble-annotated ScribbleKITTI data, to verify the ability of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) has great potential for deployment in a wide range of applications, including virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. Nevertheless, most previous studies focused on complex architectures to pursue better performance in MDE. In this letter, we aim to develop a lightweight yet highly effective self-supervised MDE model that can deliver competitive performance in edge devices. We introduce a novel MobileViT-based depth (MViTDepth) network that can effectively capture both local features and global information by leveraging the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a vision transformer (ViT). To further compress the proposed MViTDepth model, we employ knowledge distillation, which leads to improved depth estimation performance. Specifically, the self-supervised MDE MonoViT is used as a teacher model to construct the knowledge distillation loss for optimizing a student model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MViTDepth significantly outperforms Monodepth2 in terms of parameters and accuracy, thereby indicating its superiority in application to edge devices.},

  abstract={The agricultural industry has excellent potential to grow because of the vast opportunities and demands. However, despite the significant potential in agriculture, especially mushroom cultivation, there are still some problems, such as a gap between yields and market demand, because mushroom cultivators cannot produce optimal mushroom production in quality and quantity. Proper and effective cultivation processes must be carried out to produce quality oyster mushroom products in large quantities. Implementing the digital twin concept by utilizing Internet of Things and Machine Learning technology will have many good impacts to make it easier for mushroom cultivators to monitor oyster mushroom cultivation. The digital twin concept will focus on characteristics so it can represent physical objects as closely as possible. IoT will playa massive role in providing data in real-time through sensors so that things that cannot be seen physically can be known based on their data and machine learning will support the virtual modeling process so that monitoring data for mushroom growth will be available in real time according to their respective characteristics. Implementing the digital twin concept in the mushroom cultivation monitoring system requires five stages: creation, communication, aggregation, analysis, and insight. Based on the research, the digital twin concept has a huge opportunity to optimize the mushroom cultivation process because it will help mushroom cultivators know the mushroom's environmental and physical conditions in real time. Besides that, implementing digital twins will help predict environmental and mushroom conditions, harvest time estimates, treatment recommendations on each of the different mushroom characteristics, and other informative insights.},

  abstract={The trilemma trade-off problem between decentralisation, scalability, and security states that in blockchain systems the above properties are negatively correlated. Infrastructure, node configuration, choice of Consensus Protocol, and complexity of the underlying application are cited among the factors that affect the balance of the trade-off. Given that Blockchains are complex, dynamic systems, a dynamic approach to their management and reconfiguration at runtime is deemed necessary to reflect the changes in the state of the infrastructure and application. This work proposes the use of Digital Twins as the means of optimising the trilemma trade-off of blockchain i.e., re-configuring system parameters such as to maximise scalability, decentralisation and security. Specifically, through a bi-directional feedback loop between the system and the digital twin, simulation, what-if analysis and machine learning techniques will be employed for the computation of an optimal configuration given the current system state. Furthermore, a dynamic update mechanism is proposed to allow for blockchain reconfiguration without violating the decentralisation of the system.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) is a virtual replica of a physical system that is constantly receiving information from different data sources, enhancing its operations and processes through data analytics, predictions and simulations. The development of DTs relies on advancements in cutting-edge technologies namely IoT, Big data, Cloud computing and Artificial Intelligence; and although it was initially conceived in manufacturing, it is currently contributing to the digital transformation of several fields including aeronautics, healthcare, urban planning and agriculture. The existing body of research suggests that it will be expanded in the next few years with the implementation of sophisticated applications, therefore different proposals to achieve collective work between DTs have been investigated. Nevertheless, much research is needed to develop and validate appropriate mechanisms to ensure its successful deployment in complex real-world cases that require collaboration among individual systems. A Federated Digital Twin (FDT) has been identified as a promising solution for this approach, since it allows the interconnection among autonomous DTs in the virtual space, leveraging their advantages and enabling interaction, collaboration and shared learning. Additionally, since a FDT is envisaged as a network of cooperative DTs, cognitive principles can be applied to assist the overall operations through knowledge acquisition and reasoning, leading to an informed and intelligent decision making. This study aims to expand the FDT concept, develop mechanisms for coordination and synchronization based on well-defined FDT goals and connectionism theory. Furthermore, four architectural styles are provided to enable the integration of collaborative DTs within a federated environment, aiming to improve the operations in complex real-world systems.},

To further enhance this paradigm, integrating Mixed Reality (MR) technology has emerged as a promising approach to creating and working in a virtual workspace while having a safe environment for training. This work develops a framework, based on digital twin representation, to integrate the MR with real-life equipment and humans. This allows for the control of a collaborative robot in an environment with objects or humans perceived by the eye-in-hand visual sensor.

  abstract={In the context of autonomous driving, the effective recognition and understanding of traffic police gestures is crucial for safe driving on the road. Pedestrians’ body movements affect the driving system’s understanding of traffic police gestures; therefore, the localization and recognition of traffic police is key to the understanding of traffic police gesture. With the development of deep learning technology, a satisfactory traffic police localization and recognition model requires a huge amount of accurately labelled datasets, but there are no publicly available relevant datasets, and the cost of accurate labelling of datasets is extremely high, limiting the performance of the model. To address this problem, this paper proposes a High-Quality Proposals generation algorithm based on weak supervision (HQP). HQP improves the quality of region proposal generation by effectively enhancing the classification ability of a student model through guidance from a pre-trained teacher model. To compensate for the lack of localization information in image-level annotation data, HQP integrates gradient-weighted class activation maps to improve the model’s localization ability. HQP effectively reduces the workload of accurate data labelling and completes the automated labelling of data on traffic police localization and positioning by combining manual fine-tuning methods.},

  abstract={Propelled by recent advances in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and the Internet of Things (IoT), the digital twin technique has been envisioned as a de-facto driving force to bridge the virtual and physical worlds through creating digital portrayals of physical objects. In virtue of the flourishing of edge intelligence and abundant IoT data, data-driven modelling facilitates the implementation and maintenance of digital twins, where simulations of physical objects are usually performed based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). A significant advantage of adopting digital twins is to enable decisive prediction on the behaviours of objects in near future without waiting for that really happen. To provide accurate predictions, it is vital to keep each digital twin synchronized with its physical object in real-time. However, it is challenging to maintain the real-time synchronization between a digital twin and its physical object due to the dynamics of physical objects and sensing data drift over time, i.e., the live data from a physical object diverge from the model training data of its digital twin. To address this critical issue, continual learning is a promising solution to retrain models of digital twins incrementally. In this paper, we investigate digital twin synchronization issues via continual learning in an MEC environment, with the aim to maximize the total utility gain, i.e., the enhanced model accuracy. We study two novel optimization problems: the static digital twin synchronization problem per time slot and the dynamic digital twin synchronization problem for a finite time horizon. We first formulate an Integer Linear Program (ILP) solution for the static digital twin synchronization problem when the problem size is small; otherwise, we develop a randomized approximation algorithm at the expense of bounded resource violations for it. We also devise a deterministic approximation algorithm with guaranteed performance for a special case of the static digital twin synchronization problem. We thirdly consider the dynamic digital twin synchronization problem by proposing an efficient online algorithm for it. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms for continuous digital twin synchronization through simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms are promising, outperforming counterpart benchmarks by no less than 13.2%, in terms of the total utility gain.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) technology, as a promising technology, can achieve the vehicular contexts mapping of the virtual world and physical world in a collaborative autonomous driving (CAD) system. DT technology is developed on the basis of C-V2X, 6G, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Machine Learning (ML) and other technologies, which can enable the creation of robust and reliable digital twin-based collaborative autonomous driving architectures, providing a platform for testing, validating, and refining autonomous driving systems in a highly efficient and safe manner. However, the future large-scale CAD system needs greater real-time processing and resource collaboration capability for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Especially considering the mobility of AVs, it puts higher demands on the management of AVs. In this paper, we present a digital twin (DT)-based collaborative autonomous driving (DTCAD) three-layer architecture in C-V2X to provide better resource management of AVs. In order to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) and reduce the processing latency in large-scale CAD scenarios, a scalable Deep Reinforcement Learning and Mean Field Game method (DDPG-MFG) are proposed, where the dynamic and real-time interaction between AVs is approximated as a mean-field gaming process in DT resource allocation. Especially, to improve the interaction efficiency between AVs and CAD environment, we design more efficient exploitation and exploration algorithms for AVs. The CARLA simulation demonstrates our proposed algorithm significantly reduces the task offloading latency, and improves the average rewards by 28.5%, 3.5%, and 6.8%, compared with traditional DDPG, TD3, and AC, respectively.},

  abstract={This paper analyzes the requirements for the reporting rate of the live data source to support the operation of Digital Twins (DTs) of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) for real-time power systems monitoring applications. The visibility of distribution networks is currently limited due to the lack of sufficient measurement and communication infrastructures. With the rapid increase of DERs, it becomes increasingly important to improve the visibility of the distribution networks to ensure the critical system operating constrains are continuously met. DTs are virtual replicas of physical systems, and with certain live measurement data, they can be used to accurately represent the real-time dynamics of the physical entities. The features of DTs could therefore be applied to increase the visibility of network and potentially support real-time decisions making. This paper presents the investigation of the impact of data reporting rate on DT accuracy, based on which, the paper presents a method that could be used to quantify the minimum requirements for data reporting rate to adequately support the DT operation, which provides valuable learning for specifying measurement devices and communication networks to enable DTs-based solutions.},

Existing research predominantly concentrates on task allocation and path planning, with limited emphasis on integrating UAV deployment and task allocation. Despite the promise of learning-based approaches for joint optimization, their applicability to sim-to-real problems remains restricted. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical decision-making framework empowered by digital twin (DT) technology to enhance resource-efficient utilization and facilitate realtime mission planning. In the upper layer, a swarm of UAVs is divided into subgroups using a K-means method and strategically deployed to corresponding task regions. In the lower layer, a DT-enabled reinforcement learning approach is adopted to leverage real-world experiences. Specifically, we employ a multiagent deep Q learning algorithm to optimize the training process, where each agent interacts with the DT environment through original and target networks to acquire an optimal strategy. The proposed approach is evaluated using simulations that demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving high-quality plans.},

  abstract={Battery packs in electric vehicles are managed by battery management systems that influence the state of charge among the cells in the pack, where such systems have received much attention in research. More recently, balancing the temperature among the cells has become a research topic. In our work, we consider a dual-balancing problem where we aim to balance both the parameters of the state of charge and temperature. We consider a Smart Battery Pack, where individual cells can be bypassed, meaning that no current is going to or from the cell, which allows the cell to cool off while the cell does not charge or discharge. Moreover, a smart battery pack can estimate each cell's characteristics, which, in turn, can be used to define a model of cell and battery pack behavior. We conduct experiments using the model of a battery pack where each cell differs in its configuration as an effect of aging. For such a pack with heterogeneous cells, we use Q- Learning in U ppaal Stratego to synthesize a controller that maximizes the time spent in a balanced state, meaning that all cells' states are within a specific range of each other. We show significant improvements in two aspects compared with two threshold-based controllers that balance either state of charge or temperature. The synthesized controllers are only unbalanced with the state of charge between 1-4% of the time and for temperature between 15-20% of the time. The threshold-based controllers are either unbalanced for the state of charge for as much as 37 % of the time or for temperature for as much as 44 % of the time. Finally, the maximum variations of state of charge and temperature among the cells are decreased.},

  abstract={Modern Cyber-Physical Systems are characterized by dynamic and complex structure. They are facing factors such as erroneous software update, Artificial Intelligence components, reconfigurable structure, etc. Because of that, they are prone to latent or dormant faults. With the growth of data that needs to be processed, traditional error-handling mechanisms are failing to be efficient enough. For this reason, Deep Learning methods come into play. Application of such methods for detection and handling of error is nowadays a vastly used approach. However, the development of Deep Learning-based error detectors is time-consuming because there is no general approach to automatically exploit the specifics of the given system. In order to effectively address this issue, we propose a new hybrid deep learning-based methodology called Remedy. It comprises three steps: (1) identification of critical fault parameters, (2) automatic search for efficient access points for training data generation, and (3) deployment of deep learning-based error detector. To illustrate the effectiveness of this methodology, we present an implementation example on a classical Simulink model. Comparing the results with the corresponding baseline, the authors discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Industry 5.0 is a new paradigm that seeks to improve production via the use of cutting-edge technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults, for example, may severely harm industrial processes and disrupt the whole supply chain, but this integration of technology also presents significant security issues. Therefore, it is crucial in the age of Industry 5.0 to create reliable DDoS attack detection systems. In this research, we offer a DDoS attack detection system for the Industry 5.0 environment that makes use of Digital Twins (DTs) and Machine Learning (ML). Our method takes use of the strengths of DTs to model the production flow virtually, which can then be used to track the system’s behaviour and spot any hiccups. For further analysis of the DTs’ output data in order to spot possible DDoS assaults, we use explicable ML algorithms like the decision tree classifier.},

  abstract={As known, the smart Grid is an essential scenario for Industry 5.0. With its rapid development, the huge number of sensors and smart devices widely used in the industrial field generate significant amounts of data that sharply increase. Facing the power grid environment with a high amount of data, it is easy to cause abnormal conditions in the power grid system and even cause the system to collapse abruptly. To tackle this problem, we simulate a layered digital twin power grid model, using the comparative learning method to process the time series in the power grid and select the positive and negative time series samples using a new slider. In the extended Convolution Neural Network (CNN), we use the Atrous Convolution model, limiting the receptive field and concentrating more data close to the dimension of the model. The time series and process classification tasks are predicted on Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT), electricity, and University of California, Riverside (UCR) data sets, and experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the error rate of 4.38% and 5.21% in the prediction task and improves the accuracy of 8.39% and 12.73% in the classification task, indications to control the power grid model more accurately, predicting the power grid operation in the future, and take corresponding measures in time.},

  abstract={This paper investigates a digital twin (DT) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided mobile edge computing (MEC) system under given constraints on ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC). In particular, we focus on the problem of total end-to-end (E2E) latency minimization for the considered system under the joint optimization of beamforming design at the RIS, power, bandwidth allocation, processing rates, and task offloading parameters using DT architecture. To tackle the formulated non-convex optimization problem, we first model it as a Markov decision process (MDP). Later, we adopt deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to solve it effectively. We have compared the DDPG results with proximal policy optimization (PPO), modified PPO (M-PPO), and conventional alternating optimization (AO) algorithms. Simulation results depict that the proposed DT-enabled resource allocation scheme for the RIS-empowered MEC network using DDPG algorithm achieves up to 60% lower transmission delay and 20% lower energy consumption compared to the scheme without an RIS. This confirms the practical advantages of leveraging RIS technology in MEC systems. Results demonstrate that DDPG outperforms M-PPO and PPO in terms of higher reward value and better learning efficiency, while M-PPO and PPO exhibit lower execution time than DDPG and AO due to their advanced policy optimization techniques. Thus, the results validate the effectiveness of the DRL solutions over AO for dynamic resource allocation w.r.t. reduced execution time.},

  abstract={The rapid adoption of automation in the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is triggering Industry 4.0 (I4.0), integrating cloud computing, machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and universal network connectivity into traditionally isolated systems. These I4.0 changes are optimizing the performance of Smart Manufacturing (SM) systems at the cost of increased complexity, exposing I4.0 systems to more cyberattacks than ever before. To address these challenges, this work presents DT4I4-Secure: A Digital Twin Framework for Industry 4.0 Security. The DT4I4-Secure presents a framework to create Digital Twins (DT) for I4.0 systems using a combination of models (including physics and data-based models). This paper showcases the use of the DT framework to detect attacks on I4.0 systems by comparing observations with future predictions from the DT. This paper evaluates the performance of the DT4I4-Secure for a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) turning process manufacturing a metallic spool, wherein the experimental results show the model can predict normal operations with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.005081. This work also explores using an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) based dynamic threshold instead of a traditional static threshold for attack detection when the CNC turning process is under three separate attack scenarios. The DT4I4-Secure combined with the dynamic threshold shows a 3.46 times improvement in F1-Scores over all three attack scenarios for instantaneous attack detection while having 100% accuracy during the manufacturing cycle.},

  abstract={Recent advances in big data and artificial intelligence have led to active research in emotion recognition based on multimodal transformer models. Although these multimodal transformer models demonstrate high performance, their applications into real-time services are challenging due to their heavy computational requirements. Therefore, this study proposes a Multi-Still method, which transfers the multimodal knowledge of a teacher model to a student model using the knowledge distillation method supporting edge to cloud continuum environment. Multi-Still trained by text and voice data from Korean multimodal emotional datasets (KEMDy19, KEMDy20) both teacher and student. As a result, the student model transferred knowledge from the teacher model showed a 21% increase in number of inferences per second compared to the teacher model, 70.31% reduction in network size, and 65% reduction in the number of parameters. Nevertheless, it shows similar accuracy to the teacher model. We provide real-time emotion recognition services for the lightweight resources in edge continuum by efficiently learning multimodal data through knowledge distillation.},

  abstract={This study investigates the fusion of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) and generative adversarial networks (GAN), targeting specifically the flight dynamics modeling of Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Emphasis is placed on the beneficial role of transfer learning, which utilizes pre-existing models for cognate tasks, leading to heightened model efficiency and decreased computational expenses. This approach is particularly advantageous in the realm of PIML, facilitating model applicability across similar systems or scenarios. The research notably introduces a novel set of models capable of generating physically viable scenarios, thereby increasing the authenticity and effectiveness of digital twins for system dynamics prediction. Validation of this methodology through a series of flight simulations and tests reveals a significant decrease in prediction error post-transfer learning implementation. The PIGD model, for instance, shows an average error reduction of 11.30% relative to the model trained using flight test data, thus enabling more accurate predictions with scarce flight data and mitigating issues related to extensive flight tests such as safety, time, and cost. This study considerably aids in the advancement of urban air mobility, especially concerning eVTOL aircraft, and sets the stage for future explorations and applications of PIML in intricate domains.},

  abstract={Prompt-based learning has been recently popular as an emerging data efficient approach to parameter fine-tuning for various few-shot classification tasks. The knowledge transfer from a large-scale pre-trained language model could be systematically performed. It is challenging to conduct transfer learning from unlabeled data. Pseudo labeling is feasible to enhance the model generalization by unsupervised learning where additional pseudo labeled data are augmented. However, this method likely suffers from the model bias problem due to the incorrect pseudo labels. This paper presents a new collaborative pseudo labeling for prompt learning which is implemented through a teacher-student model where teacher and student are learned collaboratively. Accordingly, the resulting pseudo labels do not mislead the model while the few-shot classification task can be improved. The experiments on few-shot sentiment classification and natural language inference show the merit of collaborative pseudo labeling and prompt tuning compared with the other methods.},

  abstract={Accurate three-dimensional (3D) color models play a crucial role in various emerging applications, such as geographic surveying and mapping, smart cities, and digital twin cities. To achieve high-fidelity representations of large-scale scenes, recent advancements in machine learning techniques and LiDAR-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) have been instrumental. Leveraging these cutting-edge technologies, this paper presents a sensor-fusion framework that integrates a solid-state LiDAR, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a monocular camera. Additionally, a point cloud upsampling technique is introduced into LiDAR SLAM to enhance the density of the point clouds. Within this framework, the LiDAR-IMU odometry accurately estimates the positions and poses of the collected point clouds. Simultaneously, synchronized images are captured and utilized to incorporate texture information into the point clouds. The proposed framework demonstrates its capability to generate highly detailed and dense 3D color models for large-scale outdoor scenes, all within a limited on-site scanning time. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) technology connects various aspects of society and enhances human life. Electric vehicles (EVs) and charging stations (CSs) are essential components of the IoT system, offering business opportunities for companies like the aggregator. The aggregator can maximize profit by implementing various CSs management strategies, such as pricing and charging scheduling. However, managing CSs presents challenges due to irrational human behavior, particularly uncertain CS selections by EV users. To address this issue, we propose a cooperative model for CSs that incorporates the cognitive hierarchy quantum response CS selection model. In this model, EV users are considered to possess k-level rationality, and the charging environment is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) based on this user model. To make optimal decisions for CSs from the MDP, we propose a denoising autoencoder-based deep reinforcement learning (DEEDRL) method. This method learns from the uncertain environment and effectively denoises the state space using a pre-trained autoencoder. In addition, to reduce the computational burden caused by time-varying strategies, we design a discretization strategy for action space based on the current market rule of tiered pricing and CS types. Our experiments with real data demonstrate that our proposed method accurately portrays the CS selection behavior of irrational users in realistic scenarios. Furthermore, our method outperforms non-cooperative modes and benchmark cooperative algorithms regarding profitability, such as DDPG and DQN.},

  abstract={Digital Twin of renewable integration equipment refers to the concept of creating a digital representation of the equipment by collecting streaming data from sensors and other sources to develop a machine learning model. By training the model based on historical data, the model should be able to predict system behavior based on streaming data inputs. Most models are static, but the streaming data may be non-stationary in the case of relevant factors, and that discretization of numeric data streams is perceived as undesirable. We argue that it can be desirable for a discretization to evolve in synchronization with an evolving data stream. We investigate the discretization of various streaming data from the equipment and implement computationally efficient incremental discretization algorithms. We show that allowing a discretization to drift in synchronization with distribution drift can further identify anomalies, detect potential issues, and predict future behavior based on real-time data. The incorporation of incremental discretization into the model enables continuous updates, leading to a more accurate representation of the renewable integration equipment. This improved accuracy facilitates better decision-making and optimization of renewable integration performance.},

This work focuses on targeted attacks against the Generic Object Oriented Sub-station Event (GOOSE) protocol. The developed CDT mirrors a realistic substation network consisting of a real-time digital simulator (RTDS), industry-graded hardware relays, merging units, SDN switches, and related communication networks. The CDT consists of a virtual network to which external devices can connect, an open-source SDN flow controller to specify network packet destination, OpenFlow protocol to configure packet flows, a custom-built GOOSE parser and builder, and an open-source library to facilitate GOOSE message exchange between external hosts. Two use cases of GOOSE spoofing attacks were conducted, which were successfully detected using novel feature engineering and a machine learning approach, yielding an accuracy of 95%, precision of 96%, and F-1 score of 96%. Finally, SDN was introduced as a potential solution to mitigate such GOOSE attacks from the bottom up. The overall study underlines the proposed CDT for substation network design's efficacy in improving overall network resilience against GOOSE integrity attacks, as well as its potential for developing and validating solutions for cyber attack defense and mitigation for real-world systems.},

It is an interactive and integrative process with the physical world, involving virtualization and digitization of the real world. The high demands of the metaverse on transmission latency, processing speed, and security pose significant challenges to network load. In this article, we study an online distributed caching model in the context of digital twin metaverse. With unknown file popularity, we elaborate a collaborative caching system to optimize the burst bit error rate of wireless transmission while satisfying the latency requirements in metaverse applications. Then, we propose a meta-based self-supervised learning algorithm that can jointly allocate caching resources among various small base stations (i.e., metaverse edge nodes) in a distributed manner. Notably, given the system heterogeneity due to the massive number of devices in the metaverse, we cleverly introduce a multi-exits mechanism for neural networks to cope with the strong demand for ultra-low latency in metaverse applications. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by numerical simulations, which significantly improve the transmission efficiency compared with existing comparative methods, thus facilitating the development of green communication technologies. Therefore, these methods are of great relevance to the future development and application of metaverse.},

  abstract={In this study, we present a novel approach for efficient resource allocation in a digital twin (DT) framework for task offloading in a UAV-aided Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) network. Our approach incorporates a hybrid machine learning approach that combines asynchronous federated learning (AFL) and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to jointly optimize task completion rate, energy consumption, and delay parameters, enhancing overall system efficiency. We instantiate a DT infrastructure within a UAV-assisted IoV network for V2V and V2I task offloading with three task processing modes and three types of tasks. The DT network is composed of three distinct DTs: task vehicles, service vehicles, and roadside units. Subsequently, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the system efficiency while concurrently minimizing delay and total energy consumption. To address this challenging non-convex problem, we introduce a multi-agent DRL algorithm named MARS for resource allocation within the DT-assisted IoV network. This innovative algorithm, MARS, is trained to utilize a hybrid AFL approach referred to as HAFL. MARS optimizes the allocation of resources across various modes of computation, striving to maximize the system's overall utility. Finally, our proposed approach's effectiveness is validated through comprehensive simulation results, where it is compared against various benchmark schemes for evaluation.},

  abstract={Federated continual learning (FCL) is emerging as a key technology for time-sensitive applications in highly adaptive environments including autonomous driving and industrial digital twin. Each FCL trains machine learning models using newly-generated datasets as soon as possible, to obtain a highly accurate machine learning model for new event predictions. The age of data, defined as the time difference between the generation time of a dataset and the current time, is widely adopted as a key criterion to evaluate both timeline and quality of training. In this paper, we study the problem of age-aware FCL in a mobile edge computing (MEC) network. We not only investigate optimization techniques that optimize the data selection and aggregator placement for FCL but also implement a real system as a prototype for age-aware FCL. Specifically, we first propose an approximation algorithm with a provable approximation ratio for the age-aware data selection and aggregator placement problem for FCL with a single request. In real application scenarios, there are usually multiple FCL requests that require to train models, and delays in the MEC network are usually uncertain. We then study the problem of age-aware data selection and aggregator placement problem for FCL with uncertain delays and multiple requests, by devising an online learning algorithm with a bounded regret based on contextual bandits. We finally implement a prototype for FCL in an MEC network, with various heterogeneous user equipments (UEs) and cloudlets with different computing capabilities in the network. Experiment results show that the performance of the proposed algorithms outperform existing studies, by achieving 47% lower age of data and 12% higher model accuracy.},

  abstract={In recent years, the use of E-learning systems has increased and their efficiency has been improved, especially after emergence events like the COVID-19 crisis and other emergency situations like earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. E-learning applications present a solution for the continuity of the learning process. Learner models have been intensively applied in the learning system to improve online learning. In order to achieve this objective, it is imperative to use adaptive learning systems because learners do not have the same mental capacities and similar physical characteristics. In fact, each learner has individual features such as knowledge, goals, experiences, interests, backgrounds, personal traits, learning styles, learning activities, and study results. To make the learning content available for all learners, facilitate the learning process, and meet the learner's needs, an adaptive learning system was introduced as an alternative to the standard and traditional "one-size-fits-all". The learner model is the pivot of any adaptive learning environment, which permits the improvement of the learning process. This paper introduces a new learner model including 2 dimensions: (1) static dimensions (demographic information, interests, background, experience, learning style preference and learning situation), and (2) dynamic dimensions (Learning materials, emotion, motivation, engagement, and interaction). The developed model is applied to improve the learning process and enhance the learning results in any learning situation. Our approach is a combination of many methods and techniques to initialize and update the learner model for learning personalization. The main objective of our paper is to develop a learner modeling architecture and the way that is used to provide an adaptive learning process.},

This technology allows companies to create and manage virtual models of their physical systems and processes. This allows them to perform simulations and improve their performance. The paper reviews the various challenges and opportunities that DT technology offers in Industry 4.0. It starts by talking about the concept of Industry 4.0, focusing on its key components, and then goes on to talk about its advantages. The paper also covers the various limitations and challenges of DT technology, such as interoperability, security, and lack of high-quality data. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the various factors that manufacturers have to consider when implementing this technology in their operations. The paper also explores the possibilities offered by DT technology to transform the manufacturing industry. Although it offers numerous advantages, it acknowledges that overcoming the challenges that DT brings can be a daunting task. In addition to investing in a robust data infrastructure, the paper also suggests that organizations establish partnerships with technology firms and develop a skilled workforce that can take advantage of DT capabilities. The purpose of this paper is to provide a thorough analysis of the many advantages and drawbacks that DT technology has to offer in the context of Industry 4.0.

For the first time, we developed a Diabetic Retinopathy identifier and classifier Digital Twin to detect and diagnose damaged retina due to diabetes with the help of Deep Learning and IoT. We used EfficientNet for Transfer Learning leading to a good accuracy score being predicted. The results accumulated towards the end have proven that fusion of healthcare and Digital Twin might result in better processing of healthcare tactics by putting patients and healthcare experts in conjunction in a rational, extensive, and expandable medical ecosphere. Additionally, executing this Digital Twin offers the foundation for making the use of DL, IoT and AI with various human shape metrics for ceaseless tracking, anomaly detection as well as ideating treatments.},

  abstract={To provide a better support for various vehicular applications, digital twin (DT), as an emerging technology, can enable a virtual presentation of physical vehicular networks to reflect the current network state through real-time data updating. However, the constrained resources and high data updating cost may degrade the performance of DT. In this paper, we trade off the data updating cost and the performance of DT to adaptively determine the resource management and computation offloading in vehicular networks. Specifically, we propose a novel vehicle to vehicle pairing prediction algorithm assisted by DT to improve the offloading decision efficiency and investigate the effect of data updating frequency on prediction accuracy. Based on the prediction results, we formulate a joint data updating frequency selection, offloading decision and channel allocation problem with the objective of minimizing the computation and communication costs. To solve the formulated problem, we propose a prediction-based stability maximum pairing algorithm to obtain the proper task offloading strategy. Moreover, a deep Q-learning network algorithm is proposed to select the optimal DT data updating frequency according to the real-time vehicular network state. Based on the obtained optimal solution, we further propose an alternating direction method of multipliers-based iteration algorithm to optimize the computation and channel resource allocation and minimize the total costs. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks have made a revolution in different areas of Artificial Intelligence such as image classifi-cation and object detection. However, most of these models are heavy and time-consuming at the inference stage. If we desire to use real-time applications, it’s necessary to lighten them up. However, this could negatively affect the performance of models. One suggested approach for enhancing the capabilities of smaller models involves a technique called knowledge distillation. In this method, a less advanced model, referred to as the student model, learns from and emulates the more advanced teacher model to enhance its performance. This method has been proven as an effective technique to compress the model and increase its accuracy. Previous methods mostly focus on proposing feature transformation and loss functions between the same level’s features to improve the effectiveness. In this paper, we investigate the effect of connections between different layers of teacher and student networks and reveal their great importance. We have employed three different loss functions—attention-driven distillation, hierarchical context loss, and non-local loss—to enhance the classifier’s overall performance. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset show that the proposed method has a great performance improvement. For the benefit of the research community, we will make the code for this study available on GitHub.},

  abstract={This paper presents a study on improving human action recognition through the utilization of knowledge distillation, and the combination of CNN and ViT models. The research aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of smaller student models by transferring knowledge from larger teacher models. The proposed method employs a Transformer vision network as the student model, while a convolutional network serves as the teacher model. The teacher model extracts local image features, whereas the student model focuses on global features using an attention mechanism. The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture is introduced as a robust framework for capturing global dependencies in images. Additionally, advanced variants of ViT, namely PVT, Convit, MVIT, Swin Transformer, and Twins, are discussed, highlighting their contributions to computer vision tasks. The ConvNeXt model is introduced as a teacher model, known for its efficiency and effectiveness in computer vision. The paper presents performance results for human action recognition on the Stanford 40 dataset, comparing the accuracy and mAP of student models trained with and without knowledge distillation. The findings illustrate that the suggested approach significantly improves the accuracy and mAP when compared to training networks under regular settings. These findings emphasize the potential of combining local and global features in action recognition tasks.},

  abstract={Digitalisation in railway networks harnesses digital technologies to optimise operations, leading to enhanced efficiency, and reduced energy consumption. By analysing real-time data, railways can predict maintenance needs, improve passenger experiences, and seamlessly integrate with other transport modes. As societies strive for sustainable transportation solutions, it is imperative to understand and collect digitalisation techniques to enhance efficiency and reduce the ecological footprint of railway networks. This paper serves as a snapshot of the current state of the art addressing the pivotal role of point cloud techniques in advancing railway digitalisation and providing valuable pointers for future research directions. Employing a systematic review approach, our study concentrates exclusively on research centred around railway assets and their digitalisation via point cloud data. We have themed the literature into pre-processing, modelling, and digital twinning. Within this review, we analyse diverse modelling and pre-processing techniques and categorise them for clarity. The digital twin techniques are also collected, though these techniques are scarce in the context of railway infrastructure and point clouds. The paper also presents a compilation of dataset statistics highlighting the scarcity of openly available railway-specific datasets. This scarcity considerably hampers the feasibility of research reproducibility and the comparative analysis of different approaches. Our conclusion reflects on the challenges encountered and proposes a course for future research. Particularly, we conclude that hybrid methodologies that combine machine learning with structure-based techniques hold substantial promise toward creating digital twins, considering the intrinsic characteristics of railway infrastructure.},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={The use of microservice-based applications is becoming more prominent also in the telecommunication field. The current 5G core network, for instance, is already built around the concept of a “Service Based Architecture”, and it is foreseeable that 6G will push even further this concept to enable more flexible and pervasive deployments. However, the increasing complexity of future networks calls for sophisticated platforms that could help network providers with their deployments design. In this framework, a central research trend is the development of digital twins of the physical infrastructures. These digital representations should closely mimic the behavior of the managed system, allowing the operators to test new configurations, analyze what-if scenarios, or train their reinforcement learning algorithms in safe environments. Considering that Kubernetes is becoming the de-facto standard platform for container orchestration and microservice-based application lifecycle management, the implementation of a Kubernetes digital twin requires an accurate characterization of the microservice response time, possibly leveraging suitable Machine Learning techniques trained with measurement data collected in the field. In this paper we introduce a new methodology, based on Mixture Density Networks, to accurately estimate the statistical distribution of the response time of microservice-based applications. We show the improvement in performance with respect to simulation-based inference procedures proposed in literature.},

  abstract={Device-edge collaboration on deep neural network (DNN) inference is a promising approach to efficiently utilizing network resources for supporting artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) applications. In this paper, we propose a novel digital twin (DT)-assisted approach to device-edge collaboration on DNN inference that determines whether and when to stop local inference at a device and upload the intermediate results to complete the inference on an edge server. Instead of determining the collaboration for each DNN inference task only upon its generation, multi-step decision-making is performed during the on-device inference to adapt to the dynamic computing workload status at the device and the edge server. To enhance the adaptivity, a DT is constructed to evaluate all potential offloading decisions for each DNN inference task, which provides augmented training data for a machine learning-assisted decision-making algorithm. Then, another DT is constructed to estimate the inference status at the device to avoid frequently fetching the status information from the device, thus reducing the signaling overhead. We also derive necessary conditions for optimal offloading decisions to reduce the offloading decision space. Simulation results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our DT-assisted approach in terms of balancing the tradeoff among inference accuracy, delay, and energy consumption.},

  abstract={Network digital twin, as a fundamental enabling technology in emerging network scenarios and applications, establishes a connection between the physical and virtual networks through real-time representation and synchronization of physical entities. The value of network digital twins lies in their ability to accurately model future network states and behaviors, facilitating numerous downstream network tasks such as network optimization and management. However, the importance of network traffic prediction as an essential prerequisite module for these network tasks has been relatively overlooked. Limited surveys provide insights into the network traffic characteristics and advanced prediction models, resulting in performance degradation and unnecessary resource consumption. Hence, it deserves to explore an efficient data-driven traffic prediction framework that can adapt to different network tasks. This article first examines the general forms and characteristics of various network traffic based on specific datasets. Subsequently, we introduce a multi-module data-driven framework for network traffic prediction to effectively cater to diverse data types and downstream task requirements. A case study of cellular traffic prediction based on traffic characteristics and requirements is proposed to demonstrate the practicability of our framework. Finally, we outline several open challenges toward future traffic prediction in network digital twins.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-14},
  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD), which aims at transferring the knowledge from a complex network (a teacher) to a simpler and smaller network (a student), has received considerable attention in recent years. Typically, most existing KD methods work on well-labeled data. Unfortunately, real-world data often inevitably involve noisy labels, thus leading to performance deterioration of these methods. In this article, we study a little-explored but important issue, i.e., KD with noisy labels. To this end, we propose a novel KD method, called ambiguity-guided mutual label refinery KD (AML-KD), to train the student model in the presence of noisy labels. Specifically, based on the pretrained teacher model, a two-stage label refinery framework is innovatively introduced to refine labels gradually. In the first stage, we perform label propagation (LP) with small-loss selection guided by the teacher model, improving the learning capability of the student model. In the second stage, we perform mutual LP between the teacher and student models in a mutual-benefit way. During the label refinery, an ambiguity-aware weight estimation (AWE) module is developed to address the problem of ambiguous samples, avoiding overfitting these samples. One distinct advantage of AML-KD is that it is capable of learning a high-accuracy and low-cost student model with label noise. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets show the effectiveness of our AML-KD against state-of-the-art KD methods and label noise learning (LNL) methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Runqing-forMost/ AML-KD.},

Our work includes heuristic and constant approximation algorithms for offline multi-FL service scenarios and we also investigate an online setting of our solution with dynamic bandwidth and moving client conditions. To adapt to changing network conditions, we utilize historical bandwidth data in DTs and implement a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Ra_DDPG, for automatic bandwidth allocation. Evaluation results demonstrate a significant 49.8% increase in system utility compared to a benchmark algorithm, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach.},

  year={2023},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={The recurrent neural network (RNN)-based equalizers, especially the bidirectional long-short-term memory (biLSTM) structure, have already been proven to outperform the feed-forward NNs in nonlinear mitigation in coherent optical systems. However, the recurrent connections still prevent the computation from being fully parallelizable. To circumvent the non-parallelizability of recurrent-based equalizers, we propose, for the first time, knowledge distillation (KD) to recast the biLSTM into a parallelizable feed-forward 1D-convolutional NN structure. In this work, we applied KD to the cross-architecture regression problem, which is still in its infancy. We highlight how the KD helps the student's learning from the teacher in the regression problem. Additionally, we provide a comparative study of the performance of the NN-based equalizers for both the teacher and the students with different NN architectures. The performance comparison was carried out in terms of the Q-factor, inference speed, and computational complexity. The equalization performance was evaluated using both simulated and experimental data. The 1D-CNN outperformed other NN types as a student model with respect to the Q-factor. The proposed 1D-CNN showed a significant reduction in the inference time compared to the biLSTM while maintaining comparable performance in the experimental data and experiencing only a slight degradation in the Q-factor in the simulated data.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Low-delay high-gain optimal multi-hop routing path is crucial to guarantee both the latency and reliability requirements for infotainment services in the high mobility internet of vehicles (IoVs) subject to queue stability. The high mobility in multi-hop IoVs reduces reliability and energy efficiency, and becomes bottleneck for the optimal route solution using classical optimization methods. To a great extent, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method is not applicable in IoVs environment because of the continuously changing topology and space complexity, which grows exponentially with the number of state variables as well as the relaying hops. Usually, in multi-hop scenario, network reliability and latency are affected by mobility as well as average hop count, which limit the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) link connectivity. To cope with this problem, in this paper, we formulate a minimum hop count delay-sensitive buffer-aided optimization problem in a dynamic complex multi-hop vehicular topology using a digital twin-enabled dynamic coordination graph (DCG). Particularly, for the first time, a DCG-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DCG-MADDPG) decentralized algorithm is proposed that combines the advantage of DCG and MADDPG to model continuously changing topology and find the optimal routing solutions by cooperative learning in the aforementioned communications. The proposed DCG-MADDPG coordinated learning trains each agent towards highly reliable and low latency optimal decision-making path solutions while maintaining queue stability and convergence on the way to a desired state. Experimental results reveal that the proposed coordinated learning algorithm outperforms the existing learning in terms of energy consumption and latency at less computational complexity.},

  year={2023},

  pages={698-717},
  abstract={A digital twin (DT) leverages a virtual representation of the physical world, along with communication (e.g., 6G), computing (e.g., edge computing), and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to enable many connected intelligence services. In order to handle the large amounts of network data based on digital twins (DTs), wireless systems can exploit the paradigm of semantic communication (SC) for facilitating informed decision-making under strict communication constraints by utilizing AI techniques such as causal reasoning. In this paper, a novel framework called causal semantic communication (CSC) is proposed for DT-based wireless systems. The CSC system is posed as an imitation learning (IL) problem, where the transmitter, with access to optimal network control policies using a DT, teaches the receiver using SC over a bandwidth-limited wireless channel how to improve its knowledge to perform optimal control actions. The causal structure in the transmitter’s data is extracted using novel approaches from the framework of deep end-to-end causal inference, thereby enabling the creation of a semantic representation that is causally invariant, which in turn helps generalize the learned knowledge of the system to new and unseen situations. The CSC decoder at the receiver is designed to extract and estimate semantic information while ensuring high semantic reliability. The receiver control policies, semantic decoder, and causal inference are formulated as a bi-level optimization problem within a variational inference framework. This problem is solved using a novel concept called network state models, inspired from world models in generative AI, that faithfully represents the environment dynamics leading to data generation. Furthermore, the proposed framework includes an analytical characterization of the performance gap that results from employing a suboptimal policy learned by the receiver that uses the transmitted semantic information to construct a model of the physical environment. The CSC system utilizes two concepts, namely the integrated information theory principle in the theory of consciousness and the abstract cell complex concept in topology, to precisely express the information content conveyed by the causal states and their relationships. Through this analysis, novel formulations of semantic information, semantic reliability, distortion, and similarity metrics are proposed, which extend beyond Shannon’s concept of uncertainty. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CSC system outperforms conventional wireless and state-of-the-art SC systems by achieving better semantic reliability with reduced bits and enabling better control policies over time thanks to the generative AI architecture.},

This learning model consists of two parts. One is to select the characteristic variables of the oxygen content in flue gas through the improved sailfish optimizer (SFO) with t-distribution. The other is to use MI to prune hidden nodes dynamically in a layer-by-layer manner during the training of DSCN, and then obtain a prediction model of the oxygen content in flue gas. The experimental results show that the improved SFO can select the optimal characteristic variables, MI can effectively reduce the complexity of the DSCN after pruning and achieve the rapid and accurate prediction of oxygen content in flue gas, which lays a foundation for timely optimization and adjustment of incineration conditions.},

  abstract={Contrastive learning is a recent hot topic in computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and even a broad perspective of artificial intelligence, which also has obtained increasing attention for self-supervised graph representation learning. However, most graph contrastive learning methods might sub-optimally integrate node features and topological structures in a complex graph with rich information. To address this issue and improve the richness of node representation learned from graphs, we propose a novel contrastive node representation learning in graph via Mutual Channel Distillation(MCD), which utilizes knowledge distillation and multichannel contrastive learning techniques to improve the quality of node embeddings. Our approach applies mutual channel distillation and multi-channel contrastive learning to help the student model and the teacher model learn from each other, allowing for more diversified and informative node representation to be generated. Experimental results demonstrated that MCD yielded competitive performance over baseline models on multiple node classification and clustering benchmark datasets.},

  abstract={The eikonal equation has become an indispensable tool for modeling cardiac electrical activation accurately and efficiently. In principle, by matching clinically recorded and eikonal-based electrocardiograms (ECGs), it is possible to build patient-specific models of cardiac electrophysiology in a purely non-invasive manner. Nonetheless, the fitting procedure remains a challenging task. The present study introduces a novel method, Geodesic- BP, to solve the inverse eikonal problem. Geodesic-BP is well-suited for GPU-accelerated machine learning frameworks, allowing us to optimize the parameters of the eikonal equation to reproduce a given ECG. We show that Geodesic-BP can reconstruct a simulated cardiac activation with high accuracy in a synthetic test case, even in the presence of modeling inaccuracies. Furthermore, we apply our algorithm to a publicly available dataset of a biventricular rabbit model, with promising results. Given the future shift towards personalized medicine, Geodesic-BP has the potential to help in future functionalizations of cardiac models meeting clinical time constraints while maintaining the physiological accuracy of state-ofthe- art cardiac models.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a framework that integrates digital twin (DT) technology into space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) to enhance vehicular edge computing (VEC). Our objective is to efficiently offload tasks in ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC)-enabled vehicular networks, focusing on minimizing overall latency for requested tasks by reducing transmission time for task offloading and edge processing requirements. The proposed framework leverages DT-assisted SAGINs to minimize task offloading latency, expand network coverage, and reduce energy consumption. Key components of our framework include partial task offloading, distributed edge computing, latency modeling, energy consumption analysis, mobility, and channel modeling. We formulate a non-convex optimization problem considering various network constraints to achieve the system objective. To solve this optimization problem, we develop a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, enabling intelligent decision-making by individual agents. Through extensive simulations, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed system in advancing VEC by integrating DT technology into SAGINs.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) technologies create digital models of physical entities frequently in multimedia forms, which are crucial for concurrent simulation and analysis of real-world systems. In displaying DTs, Holographic-Type Communication (HTC) provides immersive multimedia access for users to interact with Holographic DTs (HDTs) by transmitting holographic data such as Light Field (LF) and other multisensory information. HDT has applications in remote education, work, and social interactions. However, the effective matching of demand and supply between HDT users and providers remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical architecture that integrates the DT and HTC paradigms. This architecture incorporates a marketplace for HDT services, leveraging a formulated Double Dutch Auction (DDA) mechanism to optimize matching and pricing based on user and provider valuation. Furthermore, We employ an actor-critic-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to train a DDA auctioneer that dynamically adjusts auction clocks during the auction process. As an alternative to the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), we experiment with a Deep Simplistic Variational Quantum Circuit (DSVQC) to reduce the number of parameters and enhance performance stability. Our simulations reveal that the proposed learning-based auctioneer achieves 92% optimal social welfare at a 37% auction information exchange cost for an MLP-based actor and 99% optimal social welfare at a 77% auction information exchange cost for a DSVQC-based actor.},

  abstract={In recent years, deep learning has been widely applied to learning nonlinear dynamic models for the development of a digital twin system. However, most traditional deep learning frameworks, such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and multilayer perceptrons, find it difficult to learn continuous-time and nonlinear system models. To address this challenge, in this paper, a novel deep learning method called neural controlled differential equation has been proposed to model the unknown nonlinear dynamics of controlled continuous-time systems seen in Francis hydroturbines of hydropower systems. Following the development of discretized-model structures for the system using the first principles, a detailed learning algorithm is formulated that is integrated with the physical model of the hydroturbine. As a result, a hybrid modeling with effective learning capability is obtained. To test the effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm, a set of operational data has been collected and used to train the nonlinear dynamics of the Francis hydroturbine, where the learning results of the two nonlinear dynamics, namely the mechanical torque and water flow dynamics, using the real data have indicated that the proposed method can accurately learn these unknown nonlinear dynamics in an online, adaptive way. Moreover, to address the overfitting problem that appears during the online training phase, we propose to apply a meta-learning technique to pre-train a meta-initial value for each parameter of the proposed neural controlled differential equations. It has been shown that the use of the meta-learning technique can reduce the prediction mean square error significantly by more than 60%.},

  abstract={C-V2X (Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything) is a wireless communication technology that facilitates communication between vehicles, infrastructures, and pedestrians via cellular networks, with the aim of improving road safety and efficiency. However, in autonomous mode, transmitting vehicles are unable to estimate the intended broadcast packet reception, resulting in the use of blind broadcast. This limits the reliability and latency performance of C-V2X and hinders transmission scheme optimization. To address this issue, we propose a simple but accurate prediction model to estimates packet reception rate at the transmitter side without requiring additional signaling from the receiver side. Our proposed model achieves an R2 of up to 0.92 when trained and evaluated by data generated by digital twins for the same city, and an R2 of 0.90 when transferring the trained model from a different city.},

  abstract={With the development of information technology, the next-generation information technologies such as artificial intelligence, digital twin and reconfigurable intelligent surface have become key research areas for current 6G networks. In addition, to improve the end-to-end information processing capability in the next-generation networks and better meet the demand for high-speed communication and high-precision sensing for digital twin, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality immersive services in the 6G networks, integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged. To deal with the conflict between high-quality communication services and low-latency sensing targets in an ISAC architecture, this paper investigates a UAV-assisted ISAC system in which the UAV adopts a flight-hover-communication protocol. In particular, the UAV communicates with Internet of Things (IoT) devices during the hovering period, while it senses the location of targets during the flying period. To maximize the number of connected IoT devices and minimize the energy consumption of the UAV, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based trajectory planning algorithm is designed. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect sensor devices as well as collect sensor data.},

  abstract={In the era of Information and Communication, big data is rapidly generated due to the increasing data-driven applications in Internet of Things (IoT). Effectively processing such data, e.g., knowledge learning, on resource-limited IoT becomes a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a digital twin-enabled IoT, in order to achieve hyper-connected experience, green communication, and sustainable computing. Although knowledge learning benefits from the proposed system, system latency and energy consumption are still our focus in the distributed learning architecture. To this end, we leverage Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to present the deep deterministic policy gradient with double actors and double critics (D4PG) to manage the multi-dimensional resources, i.e., CPU cycles, DT models, and communication bandwidths, enhancing the exploration ability and improving the inaccurate value estimation of agents in continuous action spaces. Extensive experimental results prove that the proposed architecture can efficiently conduct knowledge learning, and our intelligent scheme can effectively improve the system efficiency.},

  abstract={Digital Twin Edge Network (DITEN) is a new paradigm that constructs virtual models for resource allocation, system optimization, and fault prediction through real-time information sharing between physical entities and virtual environments. However, the existing DITEN faces challenges such as high computing requirements and complex network layouts. IRS is a novel type of artificial microstructured material that controls the angle and intensity of signals by manipulating reflecting units. Therefore, we address the limitations of computing capabilities and complex communication environments by incorporating IRS into the construction of DITEN. We get help from IRS to offload training tasks to edge servers at the physical network layer and create digital twin models to capture the real-time state changes of the physical network layer. Furthermore, we formulate a problem aimed at minimizing system latency and propose a federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to jointly optimize the system’s computing resources, offloading coefficients, and reflection link configurations. Experimental results demonstrate the convergence and performance improvements of our proposed algorithm under various scenarios and parameters.},
