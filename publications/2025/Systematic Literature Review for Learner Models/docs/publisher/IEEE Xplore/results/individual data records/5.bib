  year={2021},

  pages={205-216},
  abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are susceptible to various anomalies during their operations. Thus, it is important to detect such anomalies. Detecting such anomalies is challenging since it is uncertain when and where anomalies can happen. To this end, we present a novel approach called Anomaly deTection with digiTAl twIN (ATTAIN), which continuously and automatically builds a digital twin with live data obtained from a CPS for anomaly detection. ATTAIN builds a Timed Automaton Machine (TAM) as the digital representation of the CPS, and implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to detect anomalies. GAN uses a GCN-LSTM-based module as a generator, which can capture temporal and spatial characteristics of the input data and learn to produce realistic unlabeled adversarial samples. TAM labels these adversarial samples, which are then fed into a discriminator along with real labeled samples. After training, the discriminator is capable of distinguishing anomalous data from normal data with a high F1 score. To evaluate our approach, we used three publicly available datasets collected from three CPS testbeds. Evaluation results show that ATTAIN improved the performance of two state-of-art anomaly detection methods by 2.413%, 8.487%, and 5.438% on average on the three datasets, respectively. Moreover, ATTAIN achieved on average 8.39% increase in the anomaly detection capability with digital twins as compared with an approach of not using digital twins.},

  abstract={Discrete manufacturing is becoming a popular modality, which places a higher demand on the flexibility of the production line. Traditional assembly lines require extensive manual design and cannot meet the need for flexibility. Due to the rise of reinforcement learning, we suspect that modern algorithms are crucial to further improve the flexibility of assembly. In this paper, we propose a digital twin enhanced assembly method with deep reinforcement learning. A digital twin model of the assembly line is first built. Then, the deep deterministic policy gradient based reinforcement learning agent is trained on the digital twin model. The simulation of the reinforcement learning environment is based on a mixture of simulation engine and real signals. Thus, we can balance the training efficiency and the simulation accuracy. Finally, to validate our proposed method, peg-in-hole assembly experiments were conducted and good results were observed.},

  abstract={Buildings are one of the largest consumers of energy in the world and, as such, an opportunity for significant energy savings. Modelling of user behavior is a prerequisite for predicting the building energy consumption. It offers a possibility to adapt the building operation to best suit the user requirements while achieving minimal energy consumption through room air conditioning. This paper presents a deep learning model for prediction of an individual room temperature setpoint provided by the user. Model learning is conducted on the available dataset consisting of external weather and internal climate measurements. External weather conditions include the air temperature, relative humidity and direct, diffuse and global solar irradiation. The internal conditions refer to four offices for which the air temperature, the mode of operation of the fan coil controller and the temperature setpoints are available. The model is based on a neural network with Long Short-Term Memory. The highest accuracy is achieved with the model developed for the inputs of historical setpoints, system operation, day of the week and relative humidity. Presented results show high model accuracy, applicable for real-time model-based predictive building operation.},

  abstract={While noise is commonly considered a nuisance in computing systems, a number of studies in neuroscience have shown several benefits of noise in the nervous system from enabling the brain to carry out computations such as probabilistic inference as well as carrying additional information about the stimuli. Similarly, noise has been shown to improve the performance of deep neural networks. In this study, we further investigate the effect of adding noise in the knowledge distillation framework because of its resemblance to collaborative subnetworks in the brain regions. We empirically show that injecting constructive noise at different levels in the collaborative learning framework enables us to train the model effectively and distill desirable characteristics in the student model. In doing so, we propose three different methods that target the common challenges in deep neural networks: minimizing the performance gap between a compact model and large model (Fickle Teacher), training high performance compact adversarially robust models (Soft Randomization), and training models efficiently under label noise (Messy Collaboration). Our findings motivate further study in the role of noise as a resource for learning in a collaborative learning framework.},

  abstract={The power grid is considered to be the most critical piece of infrastructure in the United States because each of the other fifteen critical infrastructures, as defined by the Cyberse-curity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), require the energy sector to properly function. Due the critical nature of the power grid, the ability to detect anomalies in the power grid is of critical importance to prevent power outages, avoid damage to sensitive equipment and to maintain a working power grid. Over the past few decades, the modern power grid has evolved into a large Cyber Physical System (CPS) equipped with wide area monitoring systems (WAMS) and distributed control. As smart technology advances, the power grid continues to be upgraded with high fidelity sensors and measurement devices, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs), that can report the state of the system with a high temporal resolution. However, this influx of data can often become overwhelming to the legacy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, as well as, the power system operator. In this paper, we propose using a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) as a module within the Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems (ANGEL) Digital Twin environment to detect physical faults in a power system. The presented approach uses high fidelity measurement data from the IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 39-bus benchmark power systems to not only detect if there is a fault in the power system but also applies the algorithm to classify which bus contains the fault.},

  abstract={Human pose estimation (HPE) is a commonly used technique to determine derived parameters that are important to improve the performance of athletes in many sports disciplines. This paper proposes two methods to fine-tune a HPE system trained on general poses to a sports discipline specific HPE model using only a few labeled images. We show that 50 labeled 2D poses and additionally unlabeled videos are sufficient to achieve a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) of 88.6% at a threshold of 0.1 in the disciplines of triple and long jump, closing the gap between the supervised fine-tuning on the same 50 images and the fully supervised training on $60 \times$ more images by 60%. The first proposed method uses pseudo labels as a self-supervised training technique together with a filtering method of the pseudo labels. Furthermore, this paper shows that a mean teacher approach, which is based on consistency between a teacher and a student model, can also improve the results.},

  pages={149-156},
  abstract={The latest advancements in digital and computational technologies are increasingly enabling original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to create digital `living' replicas of their products, commonly referred to as Digital Twins (DTs). This concept is especially relevant for Commercial Aerospace Industry (CAI) OEMs, whose business models rely heavily on high-quality service delivery, and learning about the status of each individual product could translate to cost savings of the order of millions of dollars. However, while extensive debate has taken place about the specifications of a complete, idealized DT, there is comparatively little discussion about the process and key decisions necessary for implementing such concept. This makes it difficult for managers and executives to devise strategies for implementing their DTs, as well as understanding where improvement is needed or where a competitive advantage exists. This work seeks to alleviate that gap through the development of a 10-dimension maturity model for DT implementations in CAI OEMs. Using a design science research methodology, the dimensions and their corresponding maturity levels are derived systematically. A novel framework for the derivation of maturity dimensions is presented as well. The maturity model will be helpful to industry practitioners in CAI OEMs who are seeking to benchmark their own DTs or develop an implementation strategy. For academics, this maturity model advances discussions about contextual DT implementation processes. Finally, a contribution is made to the maturity model development literature through the proposed maturity dimension derivation framework.},

  abstract={Digital Twins are part of the vision of Industry 4.0 to represent, control, predict, and optimize the behavior of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). These CPPSs are long-living complex systems deployed to and configured for diverse environments. Due to specific deployment, configuration, wear and tear, or other environmental effects, their behavior might diverge from the intended behavior over time. Properly adapting the configuration of CPPSs then relies on the expertise of human operators. Digital Twins (DTs) that reify this expertise and learn from it to address unforeseen challenges can significantly facilitate self-adaptive manufacturing where experience is very specific and, hence, insufficient to employ deep learning techniques. We leverage the explicit modeling of domain expertise through case-based reasoning to improve the capabilities of Digital Twins for adapting to such situations. To this effect, we present a modeling framework for self-adaptive manufacturing that supports modeling domain-specific cases, describing rules for case similarity and case-based reasoning within a modular Digital Twin. Automatically configuring Digital Twins based on explicitly modeled domain expertise can improve manufacturing times, reduce wastage, and, ultimately, contribute to better sustainable manufacturing.},

  abstract={Service Function Chaining realized with a microservice based architecture results in an increased number of computationally cheap Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Pinning cheap VNFs to dedicated CPU cores can waste resources since not every VNF fully utilizes its core. Thus, cheap VNFs should share CPU cores to improve resource utilization. sfc2cpu learns efficient VNF to core assignments that increase throughput and reduce latency compared to three baseline algorithms. To optimize VNF assignments, sfc2cpu uses game theory combined with Neural Combinatorial optimization in a novel way. Measurements in a real hardware testbed show that sfc2cpu increases throughput by up to 36% and reduces latency by up to 59% compared to Round Robin. We show that sfc2cpu can be incrementally deployed and easily integrated into existing infrastructures.},

In this work we propose the design and construction of a software architecture that integrates a manufacturing process simulator with the well-known robot operating system (ROS-Robot Operating System) to easily interchange information with an autonomous decision-making system. The proposal is tested with the simulator Tecnomatix and the free distribution ROS Melodic. We present an instance of software architecture for a typical complex case study of manufacturing plants and demonstrate its easy integration with an autonomous decision-making system based on the reinforcement- learning paradigm.},

  abstract={Cytopathology image analysis gives an important indication of the cervical carcinoma. Automation-assisted diagnosis has received more and more attention because of its high efficiency. Thanks to the development of artificial intelligence, supervised deep learning methods have shown promising results for cervical cell detection task. However, large amounts of labeled data are quite expensive and time-consuming for acquisition. In this paper, we propose a Classification and Localization Consistency Regularized Student-Teacher Network (CLCR-STNet) with online pseudo label mining to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data for semi-supervised cervical cell detection. Both classification and localization consistency regularization are introduced to ensure that the bounding boxes predicted by the student and teacher networks are consistent. Instead of sharing the network parameters with student model, our teacher model is updated using exponential moving average (EMA). Moreover, the teacher network is used to generate high-confidence pseudo labels for unlabeled data to provide student network with more supervised information. The experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms the supervised methods learned using labeled data only.},

  abstract={We present a semi-supervised teacher-student framework to improve classification performance on gastrointestinal image data. As labeled data is scarce in medical settings, this framework is built specifically to take advantage of vast amounts of unlabeled data. It consists of three main steps: (1) train a teacher model with labeled data, (2) use the teacher model to infer pseudo labels with unlabeled data, and (3) train a new and larger student model with a combination of labeled images and inferred pseudo labels. These three steps are repeated several times by treating the student as a teacher to relabel the unlabeled data and consequently train a new student. We demonstrate that our framework can classify both video capsule endoscopy (VCE) and standard endoscopy images. Our results indicate that our teacher-student framework can significantly increase the performance compared to traditional supervised-learning-based models, i.e., an overall increase in the F1-score of 4.7% for the Kvasir-Capsule VCE dataset and 3.2% for the HyperKvasir colonoscopy dataset. We believe that our framework can use more of the data collected at hospitals without the need for expert labels, contributing to overall better models for medical multimedia systems for automatic disease detection.},

Machine Learning (ML) can improve the cognitive, reasoning and decision-making abilities of the digital twin through knowledge extraction. The full life cycle management of complex equipment is considered the key to the intelligent transformation and upgrading of the modern manufacturing industry. The application of the above two technologies in the full life cycle management of complex equipment is going to make each stage of the life cycle more responsive, predictable and adaptable.

  abstract={A digital twin is the virtual replica of a physical system. Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and autonomy of machines and products.

The digital twin concept has become increasingly sophisticated and capable over time, enabled by many technologies. In this paper, we propose the cognitive digital twin as the next stage of advancement of a digital twin that will help realize the vision of Industry 4.0. Cognition, which is inspired by advancements in cognitive science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, will enable a digital twin to achieve some critical elements of cognition, e.g., attention (selective focusing), perception (forming useful representations of data), memory (encoding and retrieval of information and knowledge), etc. Our main thesis is that cognitive digital twins will allow enterprises to creatively, effectively, and efficiently exploit implicit knowledge drawn from the experience of existing manufacturing systems and enable the transfer of higher performance decisions and control and improve the performance across the enterprise (at scale).

  abstract={The massive data generated by large-scale dynamic systems makes its optimization facing a tough challenge. Traditional White Box-based methods directly model the internal operating mechanism of the system, so massive amounts of measured data need to be handled, which is costly and time-consuming. The poor interpretability of the Black Box-based methods makes it difficult to adapt to the dynamic environment. Thus we propose a novel Gray Box-based approach namely Deep Reinforcement Learning-enabled Constraint Set Inversion Algorithm (DRESIA), which establishes a quantitative model of the nonlinear interoperability effects of system internal states which simplifies the White Box's complex mechanism of reconstruction and prediction and retains the interpretability of the model, therefore improves the prediction efficiency of feasible region while also improving the generalization ability. It further improves the dynamic adaptability of the modeling environment, which provides a new performance balancing scheme for system modeling. Under the premise that the large-scale 5G Cyber-Twin system satisfies the given Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, we perform DRESIA to realize the efficient and dynamic optimal search of feasible region, the results show that the DRESIA reduces the computational cost, and balances the accuracy and robustness of the feasible region, which validate the effectiveness and superiority of Gray Box-based approach.},

  abstract={Collaborative prognosis is a technique that enables the industrial assets to learn from similar other assets in a fleet, and improve their data-driven prognosis models. When collaborative prognosis is implemented in a computationally distributed framework, each asset is monitored by its corresponding Digital Twin agent. Distributed collaborative prognosis is particularly beneficial for high value assets where the communication and the processing costs are negligible compared to the maintenance costs. This paper analyses the effects of Digital Twin deployment strategies on the effectiveness of predictive maintenance activities relying on distributed collaborative prognosis. Distributed and heterarchical multi-agent system architectures are analysed for large fleets of assets, with varying failure rates and noise levels in the failure data. The results show that no single architecture or deployment strategy can be deemed best across all failure rates and noise levels. The conclusion derived in this paper provides guidance to the asset owners to choose the most suitable combination for a given application.},

  abstract={Sixth-generation (6G) is envisioned to be characterized by ubiquitous connectivity, extremely low latency, and enhanced edge intelligence. However, enriching 6G with these features requires addressing new, unique, and complex challenges specifically at the edge of the network. In this article, we propose a wireless digital twin edge network model by integrating digital twin with edge networks to enable new functionalities, such as hyper-connected experience and low-latency edge computing. To efficiently construct and maintain digital twins in the wireless digital twin network, we formulate the edge association problem with respect to the dynamic network states and varying network topology. Furthermore, according to the different running stages, we decompose the problem into two subproblems, including digital twin placement and digital twin migration. Moreover, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to find the optimal solution to the digital twin placement problem, and then use transfer learning to solve the digital twin migration problem. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme provides reduced system cost and enhanced convergence rate for dynamic network states.},

  abstract={This paper presents a new approach for creating real-time models of power electronic converters using dynamic neural networks. The models are time-domain, switch-averaged, large-signal, real-time, and embeddable. This combination of characteristics renders the model uniquely suited to create digital twins of the converter which can run on any platform, including locally on the converter’s digital controller. The training dataset for the proposed neural network model can be generated from simulation (rather than measured on a hardware prototype) for convenience. This work will suggest a rationale for choosing the neural network structure and hyperparameters, will discuss best practices for training and testing the model, and will include an analysis of model error. The proposed modeling approach is compared and contrasted with other real-time modeling approaches and shown to be superior to previously proposed machine learning approaches.},

  abstract={The joint spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) is a two-phase precoding scheme for massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system under frequency division duplex (FDD) mode to reduce the amount of channel state information (CSI) feedback. To apply this scheme, users need to be partitioned into groups so that users in the same group have similar channel covariance eigenvectors while users in different groups have almost orthogonal eigenvectors. In this paper, taking the clustered user model into account, we consider the user grouping of JSDM for the downlink massive MIMO system with uniform planar antenna array (UPA) at base station (BS). A deep learning based user grouping algorithm is proposed to improve the efficiency of the user grouping process. The proposed grouping algorithm transfers the statistical CSI of all users into a picture, and utilizes the deep learning enabled objective detection model you look only once (YOLO) to divide the users into different groups rapidly. Simulation results show that the proposed user grouping scheme can achieve higher sum rate with less time delay.},

  abstract={The growing digitization of manufacturing processes is revolutionizing the production job-shop by leading it toward the Smart Manufacturing (SM) paradigm. For a process to be smart, it is necessary to combine a given blend of data technologies, information and knowledge that enable it to perceive its environment and to autonomously perform actions that maximize its success possibilities in its assigned tasks. Of all the different ways leading to this transformation, both the generation of virtual replicas of processes and applying artificial intelligence (AI) techniques provide a wide range of possibilities whose exploration is today a far from negligible sources of opportunities to increase industrial companies' competitiveness. As a complex manufacturing process, production order scheduling in the job-shop is a necessary scenario to act by implementing these technologies. This research work considers an initial conceptual smart digital twin (SDT) framework for scheduling job-shop orders in a zero-defect manufacturing (ZDM) environment. The SDT virtually replicates the job-shop scheduling issue to simulate it and, based on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methodology, trains a prescriber agent and a process monitor. This simulation and training setting will facilitate analyses, optimization, defect and failure avoidance and, in short, decision making, to improve job-shop scheduling.},

  abstract={The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern regarding the development of security monitoring and management mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.},

  abstract={With the increase of the volume of data produced by IoT devices, there is a growing demand of applications capable of elaborating data anywhere along the IoT-to-Cloud path (Edge/Fog).

The H2020 IoTwins project leverages the digital twin concept to implement virtual representation of physical assets (e.g., machine parts, machines, production/control processes) and deliver a software platform that will help enterprises, and in particular SMEs, to build highly innovative, AI-based services that exploit the potential of IoT/Edge/Cloud computing paradigms.

  abstract={The rapid growth and advancement of technology in industries provide a better quality of services to the end-user in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The digital twin (DT) is an innovative technology recently developed in Industry 4.0 to provide a virtual representation of physical components, products, or equipment such as computer numerical control (CNC) machines. It can be used to run simulations before manufacturing. However, traditional DT platforms lack data privacy, traceability, immutability, authentication of stakeholders. Moreover, manual prediction of the wearing of the tool condition of the CNC machine is challenging. Motivated from these gaps, in this paper, we propose a six-layered architecture for DT of CNC, which predicts CNC tool wear detection using a novel ensemble technique based soft voted prediction model consisting of XGBoost, random forest, and AdaBoost models. The proposed architecture also incorporates the public Ethereum blockchain (BC) to maintain the aforementioned issues of authentication, traceability, and transparency through constraints and automation programmed into the smart contracts (SC) developed. We evaluate the proposed scheme’s performance through simulation and compare it with other traditional approaches concerning several performance parameters (accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall). The result shows that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional approaches on these same performance parameters such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.},

  abstract={Convolutional neural network (CNN) has been applied to glioma classification, but there is no research result of CNN compression in this field. Lightweight CNN after compression provides the possibilities of deploying into a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or a memory limited hardware and further integrating into a medical electronic equipments. To solve the problem that CNNs are difficult to deploy to embedded devices and simple-scale CNNs have low accuracy in glioma grading, this paper proposes a method based on Knowledge Distillation to classify gliomas, and introduces an SE block into the model for improvement, so as to improve the performance with less parameters and computation. Inception -ResNet - V2 is chosen as the teacher model and SqueezeNet is chosen as the student model. The results showed that after knowledge distillation, accuracy, precision, recall rate, and F1-Score of the student model increased 3.53%, 5.68%, 3.73% and 4.69%, respectively.

  year={2021},

  pages={389-393},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for alleviating the negative transfer in multi-task learning. Multi-task learning aims to learn the general meta-knowledge via sharing inductive bias for improving generalization ability. However, there exists a negative transfer problem in MTL, in which the performance improvement of a specific task leads to performance degradation of other tasks. Multi-task learning is essentially a multi-objective problem because of the task competition, necessitating a trade-off in individual optimality. Inspired by knowledge distillation, a set of task-specific teacher models can transfer the knowledge to a student multi-task model, without signicifantly loss in performance. In other words, the individual optimality can be achieved via multi-teacher knowledge distillation, where each teacher model is optimal and contains sufficient general meta-knowledge. Therefore, we propose multi-task distillation to couple with the negative transfer, turning the multi-objective optimization problem into a multi-teacher knowledge distillation problem. In detail, we firstly collect the optimal task-specific teacher models, and then achieve the individual optimality of the student model by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiment results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over current state-of-the-art multi-task learning formulations and single-task training.},

  abstract={Computer-aided automatic cephalometric landmark localization has been a hot topic since last century. Recent proposed deep learning-based methods have made great contributions to this research topic. Among them, convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based regression is widely used, where ground-truth (GT) information is mainly used in the calculation of loss function, thus, mimics the difference between the predicted landmarks ' locations and the ground-truth locations through backpropagation. However, considering the limited number of annotated cephalometric data, we believe the performance can be better improved by better utilizing ground-truth information. In this paper, we propose a teacher-student learning method using GT images for accurate cephalometric detection. We first use images composed with GT landmarks as input images to train a detection model, which is treated as a teacher model. Then the teacher model is used to guide a student model, which is trained by original images, by transferring useful features. We believe the features between GT images and original images have similar domain distribution since they both represent same structure. We validate our method on public grand challenge dataset. Our method achieves better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={The advances of mechatronic system design and system integration have shown improvements in functionality, performance and energy efficiency in many applications across industries, from autonomous ground vehicles and drones to conveyor belts. This trend has been adopted in some industries more than others. The design of equipment to handle granular or bulk material is commonly based on traditional approaches. Therefore, introducing mechatronic concepts in the design procedure can enable new possibilities, such as sensor integration and data analyses, adaptability and control. The efficiency of bulk material handling equipment in ports, agriculture and food processing is heavily influenced by the operational conditions. Typically, a piece of equipment is designed for defined operational conditions when the maximum performance can be achieved. In this work the concept of adaptability to varying operational conditions is explored by understanding the technologies implemented in other industries and the feasibility to be implemented in the bulk handling equipment design. Sensing technology, actuation and adaptability are systematically presented in this work to support the design process of the next generation of bulk handling equipment. This will pave the way for incorporating the technological trends in the design, such as: sustainability, “smartness”, Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, digital twin and machine learning. Adaptive mechatronic solutions will play a crucial role in generating and implementing innovative sustainable solutions for bulk handling equipment.},

  abstract={Recent studies have recently exploited knowledge distillation (KD) technique to address time-consuming annotation task in semantic segmentation, through which one teacher trained on a single dataset could be leveraged for annotating unlabeled data. However, in this context, knowledge capacity is restricted, and knowledge variety is rare in different conditions, such as cross-model KD, in which the single teacher KD prohibits the student model from distilling information using cross-domain context. In this study, we aim to train a robust, lightweight student under the supervision of several expert teachers, which provide better instructive guidance compared to a single student-teacher learning framework. To be more specific, we first train five distinct convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as teachers for semantic segmentation on several datasets. To this end, several state-of-the-art augmentation transformations have also been utilized in training phase of our teachers. The impacts of such training scenarios are then assessed in terms of student robustness and accuracy. As the main contribution of this paper, our proposed multi-teacher KD paradigm endows the student with the ability to amalgamate and capture a variety of knowledge illustrations from different sources. Results demonstrated that our method outperforms the existing studies on both clean and corrupted data in the semantic segmentation task while benefiting from our proposed score weight system. Experiments validate that our multi-teacher framework results in an improvement of 9% up to 32.18% compared to the single-teacher paradigm. Moreover, it is demonstrated that our paradigm surpasses previous supervised real-time studies in the semantic segmentation challenge.},

Efforts such as model partition, pruning or quantization have been used at an expense of accuracy loss. Recently proposed knowledge distillation (KD) aims at transferring model knowledge from a well-trained model (teacher) to a smaller and faster model (student), which can significantly reduce the computational cost, memory usage, and prolong the battery lifetime. In this work, we propose a novel neuron manifold distillation (NMD), where the student models not only imitate teacher’s output activations, but also learn the feature geometry structure of the teacher. Our approach produces a high-quality, compact, and lightweight student model. We conduct comprehensive experiments with different distillation configurations over multiple datasets, and the proposed method demonstrates a consistent improvement in accuracy-speed trade-offs for the distilled model.},

Traditionally, these models are carefully hand-crafted to approximate specific aspects of well-documented user behaviour. This limits their availability in virtual and augmented reality where user behaviour is often not yet well understood. Recent efforts have demonstrated that reinforcement learning can approximate human behaviour during simple goal-oriented reaching tasks. We build on these efforts and demonstrate that reinforcement learning can also approximate user behaviour in a complex mid-air interaction task: typing on a virtual keyboard. We present the first reinforcement learning-based user model for mid-air and surface-aligned typing on a virtual keyboard. Our model is shown to replicate high-level human typing behaviour. We demonstrate that this approach may be used to augment or replace human testing during the validation and development of virtual keyboards.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation has been used to transfer knowledge learned by a sophisticated model (teacher) to a simpler model (student). This technique is widely used to compress model complexity. However, in most applications the compressed student model suffers from an accuracy gap with its teacher. We propose extracurricular learning, a novel knowledge distillation method, that bridges this gap by (1) modeling student and teacher output distributions; (2) sampling examples from an approximation to the underlying data distribution; and (3) matching student and teacher output distributions over this extended set including uncertain samples. We conduct rigorous evaluations on regression and classification tasks and show that compared to the standard knowledge distillation, extracurricular learning reduces the gap by 46% to 68%. This leads to major accuracy improvements compared to the empirical risk minimization-based training for various recent neural network architectures: 16% regression error reduction on the MPIIGaze dataset, +3.4% to +9.1% improvement in top-1 classification accuracy on the CIFAR100 dataset, and +2.9% top-1 improvement on the ImageNet dataset.},

  abstract={As GAN-based video and image manipulation technologies become more sophisticated and easily accessible, there is an urgent need for effective deepfake detection technologies. Moreover, various deepfake generation techniques have emerged over the past few years. While many deepfake detection methods have been proposed, their performance suffers from new types of deepfake methods on which they are not sufficiently trained. To detect new types of deepfakes, the model should learn from additional data without losing its prior knowledge about deepfakes (catastrophic forgetting), especially when new deepfakes are significantly different. In this work, we employ the Representation Learning (ReL) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigms to introduce a transfer learning-based Feature Representation Transfer Adaptation Learning (FReTAL) method. We use FReTAL to perform domain adaptation tasks on new deepfake datasets, while minimizing the catastrophic forgetting. Our student model can quickly adapt to new types of deepfake by distilling knowledge from a pre-trained teacher model and applying transfer learning without using source domain data during domain adaptation. Through experiments on FaceForensics++ datasets, we demonstrate that FReTAL outperforms all baselines on the domain adaptation task with up to 86.97% accuracy on low-quality deepfakes.},

  abstract={Emerging technologies are facilitating our daily activities and drive the digital transformation. The Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G communications will provide a wide range of new applications and business opportunities, but with a wide and quite complex attack surface. Several users are not aware of the underlying threats and most of them do not possess the knowledge to set and operate the various digital assets securely. Therefore, cyber security training is becoming mandatory both for simple users and security experts. Cyber ranges constitute an advance training technique where trainees gain hands-on experiences on a safe virtual environment, which can be a realistic digital twin of an actual system. This paper presents the cyber ranges platform THREAT-ARREST. Its design is fully model-driven and offers all modern training features (i.e. emulation, simulation, serious games, and fabricated data). The platform has been evaluated under the smart energy, intelligent transportation, and healthcare domains.},

  abstract={With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, environmental monitoring systems using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have received considerable attention. Reliable object detection and tracking is an important research issue in various WSN applications, such as environment and disaster monitoring, disaster propagation tracking, and intruder monitoring and tracking. Generally, because batteries are used as energy sources for sensors in WSNs, a highly energy-efficient operation is needed to prolong the life of the sensors and networks. To save energy, sensors usually manage multi-mode sensing operations, in which they periodically switch between active and inactive periods. A tradeoff exists between object detection accuracy and energy efficiency when we select a sensing schedule. Depending on the object speed, direction, and sensor deployment topology, different sensing schedules should be dynamically applied to individual sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based dynamic duty cycle control method for sensor nodes. For RNN training, a target optimal duty cycle for a given network condition is derived from the proposed digital twin-space analytic solution. Simulation results show that the proposed model provides accurate object detection performance and achieves high energy efficiency.},

  pages={173-179},
  abstract={Deep learning models are proven to deliver satisfactory results on training a complex non-linear relationship between the set of input features and different task outputs. However, they are memory intensive and require good computational power for both training as well as inferencing. In literature one can find different model compression techniques which enables easy deployment on edge devices. Knowledge distillation is one such approach where the knowledge of complex teacher model is transferred to a lower parameter student model. However, the limitation is that the architecture of the student model should be comparable to the complex teacher model for better knowledge transfer. Due to this limitation, we cannot deploy this student model that learns from a complex and huge teacher on edge devices. In this work, we propose to use a combined student approach wherein different student models learn from a common teacher model. Further, we propose a unique loss function which will train multiple student models simultaneously. An advantage of this approach is that these student models can be as simple as possible when compared with traditional single student model and also the complex teacher model. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation to prove that our approach can improve the overall accuracy significantly and allow a further compression by 10% when compared with generic model.},

  abstract={Self-supervised speech representation learning has been considered as an outstanding manner to improve the performance of downstream tasks. However, those models are often too cumbersome, which sets a barrier to deploy them on the edge and improves the threshold of the pre-training process. In this paper, we propose Audio DistilBERT, a distilled BERT-style speech representation learning method. It learns dark knowledge from a larger teacher model through one new designed loss which combines soft and hard targets. By doing this, it can achieve competitive performance with fewer parameters and faster inference time. The experimental results among two downstream tasks show that the proposed method can retain above 98% performance of the large model with about 1.8× smaller model size and over 1.6× faster inference speed. In a low-resource environment with very few labeled data and pretraining steps, our model also exhibits similar or even better performance compared to the large model. Furthermore, we explore the knowledge transfer competence between the teacher and student model.},

  abstract={Existing methods for distillation do not efficiently utilize the training data. This work presents a novel approach to perform distillation using only a subset of the training data, making it more data-efficient. For this purpose, the training of the teacher model is modified to include self-regulation wherein a sample in the training set is used for updating model parameters in the backward pass either if it is misclassified or the model is not confident enough in its prediction. This modification restricts the participation of samples, unlike the conventional training method. The number of times a sample participates in the self-regulated training process is a measure of its significance towards the model's knowledge. The significance values are used to weigh the losses incurred on the corresponding samples in the distillation process. This method is named significance-based distillation. Two other methods are proposed for comparison where the student model learns by distillation and incorporating self-regulation as the teacher model, either utilizing the significance information computed during the teacher's training or not. These methods are named hybrid and regulated distillations, respectively. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed methods achieve similar performance as other state-of-the-art methods for knowledge distillation while utilizing a significantly less number of samples.},

  abstract={Recent studies in deep learning based speech enhancement have seen great progress. However, it remains a challenging problem to balance between high accuracy and complexity of the speech enhancement models. To address this issue, we propose a novel speech enhancement framework that consists of a two-stage training module and a co-worker based speech enhancement network (Co-worker-SENet). In the training phase, we first train a teacher model to extract basic features. Then, a student model learns from the teacher at some early steps and further refines the features. Both the teacher and student models are Co-worker-SENet where a stack of feature extraction (FE) blocks is used to learn and refine the features. The FE block consists of multiple cheap workers, which extract features independently. Those features are then fused as the output of the FE block. We conduct extensive experiments on the commonly used VoiceBank-Demand dataset, and the experimental results show that the two-stage training framework can effectively improve the performance of the one-stage method and performs comparably to other state-of-the-art approaches with simple and cheap operations.},

  abstract={For classification tasks, deep neural networks are prone to overfitting in the presence of label noise. Although existing methods are able to alleviate this problem at low noise levels, they encounter significant performance reduction at high noise levels, or even at medium noise levels when the label noise is asymmetric. To train classifiers that are universally robust to all noise levels, and that are not sensitive to any variation in the noise model, we propose a distillation-based framework that incorporates a new subcategory of Positive-Unlabeled learning. In particular, we shall assume that a small subset of any given noisy dataset is known to have correct labels, which we treat as “positive”, while the remaining noisy subset is treated as “unlabeled”. Our framework consists of the following two components: (1) We shall generate, via iterative updates, an augmented clean subset with additional reliable “positive” samples filtered from “unlabeled” samples; (2) We shall train a teacher model on this larger augmented clean set. With the guidance of the teacher model, we then train a student model on the whole dataset. Experiments were conducted on the CIFAR-10 dataset with synthetic label noise at multiple noise levels for both symmetric and asymmetric noise. The results show that our framework generally outperforms at medium to high noise levels. We also evaluated our framework on Clothing1M, a real-world noisy dataset, and we achieved 2.94% improvement in accuracy over existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={We propose the concept of a “digital twin” - namely, a data-driven simulation model of a full-duplex transceiver chain - to enable real-time computational modeling of the entire radio frequency (RF) system, including non-linearities, self-interference coupling, and other performance metrics that depend on multiple hard-to-model factors including the transmit signals and their waveforms, the peak power level, the instantaneous transmit power level, the transceiver circuit settings, and the proximity of the receiver. A machine-learning approach is explored for obtaining artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital twins of various types, including traditional (shallow) neural networks, deep belief networks, and deep convolutional networks for supervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning approaches. While several related approaches exist in the literature, they have generally been limited to simulations. By contrast, the goal of this work is to study the performance of state-of-art machine learning algorithms in an experimental framework using real-world test data obtained from a recently completed STAR front-end [1] . The proposed STAR front-end has measured bandwidths of better than 500 MHz across al-3 GHz range and provides better than 80 dB analog cancellation of self-interference. A dataset of experimental measurements of this front-end will be collected and applied to a suite of ML algorithms for self-interference cancellation that has recently appeared in the literature. The machine learning algorithms will be evaluated for performance in terms of computational complexity, latency, power consumption, and the reduction of self-interference from the transmitter into the receiver during STAR operation.},

Specifically, a well-trained convolutional neural network is adopted to fit the nonlinear function mapping relationship between the input set (the line conditions and running time of the train in each section) and the output set (the energy consumption of the optimal speed profile and the switching points), which greatly reduces the calculation time of the optimal recommended speed profile in the process of train regulation. An integrated optimization model is proposed with the aim to minimize the total train delay and energy consumption, a hybrid search algorithm based on particle swarm optimization and a genetic algorithm was developed to solve the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified based on the actual operating data of a Beijing subway line.},

To further improve the data efficiency of reinforcement learning, which often requires a large amount of agent-environment interactions during the training process, we propose a digital-twin environment model that can predict the transition dynamics of the physical driving scene. Moreover, we propose a rollout prediction-compatible reinforcement learning framework, which is able to further improve the training efficiency. The proposed framework is validated in an autonomous driving task with a focus on lateral motion control.

  abstract={Recently developed large pre-trained language models, e.g., BERT, have achieved remarkable performance in many downstream natural language processing applications. These pre-trained language models often contain hundreds of millions of parameters and suffer from high computation and latency in real-world applications. It is desirable to reduce the computation overhead of the models for fast training and inference while keeping the model performance in downstream applications. Several lines of work utilize knowledge distillation to compress the teacher model to a smaller student model. However, they usually discard the teacher's knowledge when in inference. Differently, in this paper, we propose RemERT to leverage the knowledge learned from the teacher, i.e., facilitating the pre-computed BERT representation on the reference sample and compressing BERT into a smaller student model. To guarantee our proposal, we provide theoretical justification on the loss function and the usage of reference samples. Significantly, the theoretical result shows that including the pre-computed teacher's representations on the reference samples indeed increases the mutual information in learning the student model. Finally, we conduct the empirical evaluation and show that our RemERT can beat the vanilla TinyBERT over 8.1 % and achieves more than 94% of the performance of $\mathbf{BERT}_{\mathbf{BASE}}$ on the GLUE benchmark. Meanwhile, RemERT is $\mathbf{7.4x}$ smaller and $\mathbf{9.5x}$ faster on inference than $\mathbf{BERT}_{\mathbf{BASE}}$.},

  abstract={To reduce Operation and Maintenance (O&M) expenditure on offshore wind farms, wherein 80% of the cost relates to deploying personnel, the offshore wind sector looks to advances in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) for solutions. Barriers to residential Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) autonomy as a service, include operational challenges in run-time safety compliance, reliability and resilience, due to the complexities of dealing with known and unknown risk in dynamic environments. In this paper we incorporate a Symbiotic System Of Systems Approach (SSOSA) that uses a Symbiotic Digital Architecture (SDA) to provide a cyber physical orchestration of enabling technologies. Implementing a SSOSA enables Cooperation, Collaboration and Corroboration (C3), as to address run-time verification of safety, reliability and resilience during autonomous missions. Our SDA provides a means to synchronize distributed digital models of the robot, environment and infrastructure. Through the coordinated bidirectional communication network of the SDA, the remote human operator has improved visibility and understanding of the mission profile. We evaluate our SSOSA in an asset inspection mission within a confined operating environment. Demonstrating the ability of our SSOSA to overcome safety, reliability and resilience challenges. The SDA supports lifecycle learning and co-evolution with knowledge sharing across the interconnected systems. Our results evaluate both sudden and gradual faults, as well as unknown events, that may jeopardize an autonomous mission. Using distributed and coordinated decision making, the SSOSA enhances the analysis of the mission status, which includes diagnostics of critical sub-systems within the resident robot. This evaluation demonstrates that the SSOSA provides enhanced run-time operational resilience and safety compliance to BVLOS autonomous missions. The SSOSA has the potential to be a highly transferable methodology to other mission scenarios and technologies, providing a pathway to implementing scalable autonomy as a service.},

Within this research project, the automation back-bone developed for the SUPSI MiniFactory [1], coupled with adaptive Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, is exploited to test numerous families of bearings. The MiniFactory is associated with an evolving digital profile, a digital twin, based on constant synchronization through IoT devices, that encompasses a massive, real-time, real-world data, gathered from the different sensors interfaced via OPC-UA protocol. This representation feeds a ML algorithm capable of 1) detecting defective bearings and 2) continually tuning the quality testing process parameters based on the analysis performed on the gathered data. Specifically, the identification of defective bearings is performed by a voting classifier fed by statistical metrics measured from the collected experiments. Our approach also aims at continually learning from the tests performed with the cell: the ML algorithm is tuned and adjusted every time a new set of tests is executed. Tests show that the proposed ML classifier accurately distinguishes damaged and uncorrupted bearings (accuracy ∼ 100%, precision ∼100%, recall ∼100%, TNR ∼100%). The digitalization of the quality control process is furtherly enriched by the development of a data aggregator platform. The platform fetches, cleans and aggregates data from every different machine belonging to the quality cell, enabling, also remotely, the pattern-tracking, the significant KPIs displaying and the comprehensive system behavior monitoring.

  abstract={Virtual simulation and digital twins are two vital methodologies to achieve visual-based simulation. This paper will discuss common features and also differences between the two methodologies regarding the use purposes, requirements, and enabling technologies, etc. Virtual simulation is mainly used for education, for which physical test rigs are not necessarily required. While for digital twins, they can be employed for education and research purposes, and the corresponding physical test rigs are typically required. To illustrate the detailed design and implementation of virtual simulation and digital twins, the experience with networked control system laboratory (NCSLab) is taken as an example. Various different kinds of three-dimensional test rigs have been developed for virtual simulation, which has been utilized for education for years. The methodologies to achieve digital twin online laboratories are also explored using NCSLab.},

  abstract={AI is one of the biggest megatrends towards the 4th industrial revolution. Although these technologies promise business sustainability as well as product and process quality, it seems that the ever-changing market demands, the complexity of technologies and fair concerns about privacy, impede broad application and reuse of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models across the industry. To break the entry barriers for these technologies and unleash its full potential, the knowlEdge project will develop a new generation of AI methods, systems, and data management infrastructure. Subsequently, as part of the knowlEdge project we propose several major innovations in the areas of data management, data analytics and knowledge management including (i) a set of AI services that allows the usage of edge deployments as computational and live data infrastructure as well as a continuous learning execution pipeline on the edge, (ii) a digital twin of the shop-floor able to test AI models, (iii) a data management framework deployed along the edge-to-cloud continuum ensuring data quality, privacy and confidentiality, (iv) Human-AI Collaboration and Domain Knowledge Fusion tools for domain experts to inject their experience into the system, (v) a set of standardisation mechanisms for the exchange of trained AI models from one context to another, and (vi) a knowledge marketplace platform to distribute and interchange trained AI models. In this paper, we present a short overview of the EU Project knowlEdge –Towards Artificial Intelligence powered manufacturing services, processes, and products in an edge-to-cloud-knowledge continuum for humans [in-the-loop], which is funded by the Horizon 2020 (H2020) Framework Programme of the European Commission under Grant Agreement 957331. Our overview includes a description of the project’s main concept and methodology as well as the envisioned innovations.},

  abstract={The research about the digital twin concept is growing worldwide, especially in the industrial sector, due to the increasing digitisation level associated to Industry 4.0. The application of the digital twin concept improves performance of a system by implementing monitoring, diagnosis, optimisation, and decision support actions. In particular, the decision-making process is very time consuming since the decision-maker is presented with hundreds of different scenarios that can be simulated and assessed in a what-if perspective. Bearing this in mind, this paper proposes to integrate a digital twin-based what-if simulation with a recommendation system to improve the decision-making cycle. The recommendation system is based on a reinforcement learning technique and takes user knowledge of the system into consideration and trust in the system recommendation. The applicability of the proposed approach is presented in an assembly line case study for recommending the best configurations for the system operation, in terms of the optimal number of AGVs (Autonomous Guided Vehicles) in various scenarios. The achieved results show its successful application and highlight the benefits of using AI-based recommendation systems for what-if simulation in digital twin systems.},

  abstract={Amongst the utilizations of Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PoISAR) data, semi-supervised terrain classification is much in demand. Samples of the same category are distributed in multiple regions of a PolSAR image, resulting in differences in the feature distributions of samples of the same category located in different regions. In addition, some samples of confusable categories, and samples of different categories located near the edges, have small feature differences in a PolSAR image. To address this problem, we introduce a graph regular loss constructed from pseudo-labels to constrain the intra-class similarity and inter-class similarity of features, and improve the discriminative property of features. In addition, since the quality of pseudo-labels affects the optimization of the model by the graph regular loss, we introduce the idea of clustering into the teacher-student model to improve the quality of pseudo-labels. Experiments on real PolSAR data show that our proposed method achieves an excellent performance.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={10-15},
  abstract={The use of industrial robots plays an increasingly important role in today’s production technology. Many fabrication processes like milling or gluing have high demands on accuracy and path smoothness to ensure good path tracking. Yet, industrial robot paths in cartesian space mainly consist of a sequence of linear and circular movements and hence show velocity and acceleration discontinuities in the segment transitions. This significantly limits the productivity and machining quality of the robot system. Traversing these discontinuities activates the kinematics mechanically and hence influences the accuracy and surface quality. In addition, the drives of the robot system are subjected to a higher load as a result which decreases the lifetime of the robot. Higher-order continuous paths are required to prevent this. Corner smoothing methods insert smooth, curvature continuous curves in the segment transition resulting in smooth paths. Methods based on polynomial smoothing splines either do not have any curvature-optimality properties or cannot be solved without violating the online constraints of the robot controller. To solve the conflict between the calculation of curvature-optimal smoothing curves and online execution in industrial robot controllers, this paper evaluates the use of neural networks as a model for calculating optimal geometry parameters for corner smoothing with polynomial splines. The model is trained applying supervised learning on a dataset containing offline generated pairs of geometries and optimal parameters. The presented method leads to curvature-optimized smoothing curves and is suitable for online path planning. The application of neural networks to this path planning problem is evaluated in a simulation using a digital twin model of an industrial robot.},

  abstract={In this article, we propose a novelteacher–student-based label propagation deep semisupervised learning (TSLP-SSL) method for sea ice classification based on Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data. For sea ice classification, labeling the data precisely is very time consuming and requires expert knowledge. Our method efficiently learns sea ice characteristics from a limited number of labeled samples and a relatively large number of unlabeled samples. Therefore, our method addresses the key challenge of using a limited number of precisely labeled samples to achieve generalization capability by discovering the underlying sea ice characteristics also from unlabeled data. We perform experimental analysis considering a standard dataset consisting of properly labeled sea ice data spanning over different time slots of the year. Both qualitative and quantitative results obtained on this dataset show that our proposed TSLP-SSL method outperforms deep supervised and semisupervised reference methods.},

  abstract={A new industrial production model based on digitalization, system interconnection, virtualization and data exploitation, has emerged. Upgrade of production processes towards this Industry 4.0 model is one of the critical challenges for the industrial sector and, consequently, the training of students and professionals has to address these new demands. To carry out this task, it is essential to develop educational tools that allow students to interact with real equipment that implements, in an integrated way, new enabling technologies, such as connectivity with standard protocols, storage and data processing in the cloud, machine learning, digital twins and industrial cybersecurity measures. For that reason, in this work, we present an educational environment on Industry 4.0 that incorporates these technologies reproducing realistic industrial conditions. This environment includes cutting-edge industrial control system technologies, such as an industrial firewall and a virtual private network (VPN) to strengthen cybersecurity, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateway to transfer process information to the cloud, where it can be stored and analyzed, and a digital twin that virtually reproduces the system. A set of hands-on tasks for an introductory automation course have been proposed, so that students acquire a practical understanding of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 and of its function in a real automation. This course has been taught in a master’s degree and students have assessed its usefulness by means of an anonymous survey. The results of the educational experience have been useful both from the students’ and faculty’s viewpoint.},

In this paper, we review the current research landscape as regards digital twins in the field of smart cities, while also attempting to draw parallels with the application of digital twins in Industry 4.0. Although digital twins have received considerable attention in the Industrial Internet of Things domain, their utilization in smart cities has not been as popular thus far. We discuss here the open challenges in the field and argue that digital twins in smart cities should be treated differently and be considered as cyber-physical “systems of systems”, due to the vastly different system size, complexity and requirements, when compared to other recent applications of digital twins. We also argue that researchers should utilize established tools and methods of the smart city community, such as co-creation, to better handle the specificities of this domain in practice.},

  pages={194-201},
  abstract={With automated driving forthcoming, lane-changing for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) has received wide attention. The main challenge is that lane-changing requires not only local CAV control but also interactions with the surrounding traffic. Nevertheless, the Line-of-Sight (LoS) sensing range of the CAVs imposes severe limitations on lane-changing safety, and the lane-changing decision that is made based only on self-interest ignores its impact on the traffic flow efficiency. To overcome these difficulties, this article proposes a Digital Twin (DT) empowered mobile edge computing (MEC) architecture. With MEC, the sensing and computing capabilities of the CAVs can be strengthened to guarantee real-time safety. The virtualization and offline learning capabilities of the DT can be leveraged to enable the CAVs to learn from the experience of the physical MEC network and make lane-changing decisions via a ‘foresight intelligent’ approach. A case study of lane-changing is provided where the DT is constituted by a cellular automata based road traffic simulator coupled with a LTE-V based MEC network simulator. Deep reinforcement learning is adopted to train the lane-changing strategy and results validate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture.},

  abstract={Smart environments, such as Industry 4.0 or smart cities, are based on digital technologies that collect large amounts of data and artificial intelligence applications—or agents—to analyze this data and optimize various operational aspects of the environment. However, any intelligent environment must include humans. In this case, the interactions between humans and agents, referred to as human-agent interaction (HAI), will occur in complex arrangements involving multiple humans and agents interacting concurrently along with various scenarios. Agents’ ability to learn and perform their tasks is contingent on some degree of consistency in their interactions with humans. A lack of such consistency would jeopardize their learning and performance. It is thus necessary to integrate humans and agents across the entire environment consistently. Assuming that HAI is a complex system, the paper argues that ensuring HAI consistency can be achieved by deploying a new class of agents devoted to managing human-agent interactions, the Human Digital Twin (HDT). The proposed HDTs are placed alongside each human in the HAI environment to observe and learn about their interaction patterns and then use them to ensure HAI consistency.},

  abstract={The digital twin (DT) bridges the physical world with the digital world in real-time for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and federated learning (FL) enables edge intelligence services for IIoT under the premise of avoiding privacy leakage. The fusion of two technologies can extremely accelerate the development of Industry 4.0 by enabling instant intelligence services. However, in the resource-constrained IIoT, the energy consumption of performing FL and maintaining the virtual object in the digital space by DT technology become the bottlenecks and can not be ignored. To address these issues, in this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient FL framework for DT-enabled IIoT. In the proposed framework, IIoT devices choose different training methods considering dynamic time-varying environment status to achieve energy-efficient FL, i.e., either train locally or connect to the virtual object by DT in the corresponding server of a small base station (SBS) to train mapped data using computing resources of SBS. Then, we investigate the joint training method selection and resource allocation problem to minimize the energy consumption while satisfying the convergence rate of the training model. Considering the problem is intractable using traditional approaches, we use a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to solve it. Simulation results show that the proposed framework decreases greatly energy consumption compared with the static framework while satisfying the convergence rate of FL.},

  abstract={This paper presents a safe imitation learning approach for autonomous vehicle driving, with attention on real-life human driving data and experimental validation. In order to increase occupant's acceptance and gain drivers' trust, the autonomous driving function needs to provide a both safe and comfortable behavior such as risk-free and naturalistic driving. Our goal is to obtain such behavior via imitation learning of a planning policy from human driving data. In particular, we propose to incorporate barrier functions and smooth spline-based motion parametrization in the training loss function. The advantage is twofold: improving safety of the learning algorithm, while reducing the amount of needed training data. Moreover, the behavior is learned from highway driving data, which is collected consistently by a human driver and then processed towards a specific driving scenario. For development validation, a digital twin of the real test vehicle, sensors, and traffic scenarios are reconstructed toward high-fidelity and physics-based modeling technologies. These models are imported to simulation tools and co-simulated with the proposed algorithm for validation and further testing. Finally, we present experimental results and analyses, and compare with the conventional imitation learning technique (behavioral cloning) to justify the proposed development.},

  abstract={Semantic correspondence is a fundamental problem in computer vision, which aims at establishing dense correspondences across images depicting different instances under the same category. This task is challenging due to large intra-class variations and a severe lack of ground truth. A popular solution is to learn correspondences from synthetic data. However, because of the limited intra-class appearance and background variations within synthetically generated training data, the model’s capability for handling “real” image pairs using such strategy is intrinsically constrained. We address this problem with the use of a novel Probabilistic Model Distillation (PMD) approach which transfers knowledge learned by a probabilistic teacher model on synthetic data to a static student model with the use of unlabeled real image pairs. A probabilistic supervision reweighting (PSR) module together with a confidence-aware loss (CAL) is used to mine the useful knowledge and alleviate the impact of errors. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks show that our PMD achieves state-of-the-art performance. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we extend PMD to incorporate stronger supervision for better accuracy – the probabilistic teacher is trained with stronger key-point supervision. Again, we observe the superiority of our PMD. The extensive experiments verify that PMD is able to infer more reliable supervision signals from the probabilistic teacher for representation learning and largely alleviate the influence of errors in pseudo labels.

However, there is still a large gap on performance compared to their supervised counterparts. We focus on a more practical setting of semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) where both a small set of labeled target data and large amounts of labeled source data are available. To address the task of SSDA, a novel framework based on dual-level domain mixing is proposed. The proposed framework consists of three stages. First, two kinds of data mixing methods are proposed to reduce domain gap in both region-level and sample-level respectively. We can obtain two complementary domain-mixed teachers based on dual-level mixed data from holistic and partial views respectively. Then, a student model is learned by distilling knowledge from these two teachers. Finally, pseudo labels of unlabeled data are generated in a self-training manner for another few rounds of teachers training. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework on synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation benchmarks.},

  abstract={Most existing distance metric learning approaches use fully labeled data to learn the sample similarities in an embedding space. We present a self-training framework, SLADE, to improve retrieval performance by leveraging additional unlabeled data. We first train a teacher model on the labeled data and use it to generate pseudo labels for the unlabeled data. We then train a student model on both labels and pseudo labels to generate final feature embeddings. We use self-supervised representation learning to initialize the teacher model. To better deal with noisy pseudo labels generated by the teacher network, we design a new feature basis learning component for the student network, which learns basis functions of feature representations for unlabeled data. The learned basis vectors better measure the pairwise similarity and are used to select high-confident samples for training the student network. We evaluate our method on standard retrieval benchmarks: CUB-200, Cars-196 and In-shop. Experimental results demonstrate that with additional unlabeled data, our approach significantly improves the performance over the state-of-the-art methods.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={3578-3587},
  abstract={Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a popular technique to transfer knowledge from a teacher model or ensemble to a student model. Its success is generally attributed to the privileged information on similarities/consistency between the class distributions or intermediate feature representations of the teacher model and the student model. However, directly pushing the student model to mimic the probabilities/features of the teacher model to a large extent limits the student model in learning undiscovered knowledge/features. In this paper, we propose a novel inheritance and exploration knowledge distillation framework (IE-KD), in which a student model is split into two parts - inheritance and exploration. The inheritance part is learned with a similarity loss to transfer the existing learned knowledge from the teacher model to the student model, while the exploration part is encouraged to learn representations different from the inherited ones with a dis-similarity loss. Our IE-KD framework is generic and can be easily combined with existing distillation or mutual learning methods for training deep neural networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these two parts can jointly push the student model to learn more diversified and effective representations, and our IE-KD can be a general technique to improve the student network to achieve SOTA performance. Furthermore, by applying our IE-KD to the training of two networks, the performance of both can be improved w.r.t. deep mutual learning.},

  volume={},

  pages={8183-8192},
  abstract={Recently unsupervised domain adaptation for the semantic segmentation task has become more and more popular due to high-cost of pixel-level annotation on real-world images. However, most domain adaptation methods are only restricted to single-source-single-target pair, and can not be directly extended to multiple target domains. In this work, we propose a collaborative learning framework to achieve unsupervised multi-target domain adaptation. An unsupervised domain adaptation expert model is first trained for each source-target pair and is further encouraged to collaborate with each other through a bridge built between different target domains. These expert models are further improved by adding the regularization of making the consistent pixel-wise prediction for each sample with the same structured context. To obtain a single model that works across multiple target domains, we propose to simultaneously learn a student model which is trained to not only imitate the output of each expert on the corresponding target domain, but also to pull different expert close to each other with regularization on their weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively exploit rich structured information contained in both labeled source domain and multiple unlabeled target domains. Not only does it perform well across multiple target domains but also performs favorably against state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods specially trained on a single source-target pair.

As it is difficult to have the same learning path that suits different learners, the Curriculum Sequencing problem (CS) consists of the generation of a personalized learning path for each learner according to his learner profile. This last one is represented through competencies. The proposed approach includes two components: (1) competency based approach that is used to represent the knowledge model and to deliver to the learner the learning path; and (2) a DNA computing approach based on a weighted graph is used to deliver a learning path to each learner. An example regarding the course of algorithmic is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.

  abstract={Machine Learning has the potential to discover new correlations between energy usage in apartments and variables such as seasonality, apartment location, size, efficiency and details of those staying in the apartments, thus helping apartments to become more sustainable and helping those who stay in them to use less energy. The biggest impedance to creating such ML tools is lack of viable data - without the data, the tools cannot be created - yet it is not feasible to wait for several years' worth of good data before creating the tools. Here we present a solution to this problem: the use of a digital twin to generate synthetic data. This approach is viable even when there is no existing data, but when expert knowledge about the relationship between systems exist. To achieve this, we develop a new agent-based synthetic data generator (ASDG) and explore a case study with a corporate housing and luxury alternate accommodation marketplace called TheSqua.re. We show that unlimited quantities of realistic data can be automatically generated, including data for different scenarios, and that it can be used by Machine Learning to discover the underlying correlations.},

  abstract={In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, robust beamforming is a key technology that alleviates multi-user interference under channel estimation errors. Recently, stochastic weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm was proposed to achieve robust risk-neutral beamforming, assuming the knowledge of channel probability distribution. However, this information is difficult to acquire especially in the fifth generation new radio (5G NR) frequency division duplex (FDD) systems with limited feedback. To tackle this challenge, different from previous works relying on Gaussian assumptions, we propose a digital twin-aided approach that directly learns the channel generative process from the limited feedback information via deep generative models. Numerical results are presented to show the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of both channel generation and robust beamforming.},

  abstract={Adaptive learning technology solutions often use a learner model to trace learning and make pedagogical decisions. The present research introduces a formalized methodology for specifying learner models, logistic knowledge tracing (LKT), that consolidates many extant learner modeling methods. The strength of LKT is the specification of a symbolic notation system for alternative logistic regression models that is powerful enough to specify many extant models in the literature and many new models. To demonstrate the generality of LKT, we fit 12 models, some variants of well-known models and some newly devised, to six learning technology datasets. The results indicated that no single learner model was best in all cases, further justifying a broad approach that considers multiple learner model features and the learning context. We introduce features to stand in for student-level intercepts and argue that to be maximally applicable, a learner model needs to adapt to student differences. The results of our comparisons show the general importance of modeling recent learning for all datasets, with special importance for terms that model memory in datasets involving fact learning.},

  abstract={The goal is to explore the prediction performance of energy consumption in digital twins of the intelligent factory in the process of urbanization, so that it can provide good guidance for the green development of cities. The digital twin technology is introduced into the intelligent factory, in view of the influence of life cycle, data transmission delay and other factors of the equipment on product energy consumption of intelligent factory manufacturing in the real physical environment. Meanwhile, it is improved by DL (deep learning) algorithm to construct an improved AlexNet algorithm framework. Then, DPFS (Differential Privacy Frequent Subgraph) algorithm is adopted to build a digital twin energy consumption prediction model of intelligent factory based on DL and privacy algorithm. Finally, a simulation scenario is established to verify its performance. Through the comparative analysis of the digital twin energy consumption prediction model and other scholars’ models in related fields, the feature recognition accuracy of the constructed model reaches 89.23%, at least 1.95% higher than that of other neural network models. From the perspective of energy consumption data transmission performance, the data message delivery rate of the proposed model is not less than 80%. Besides, the data message leakage rate and packet loss rate are less than 11%, and the average delay is basically stable. Therefore, the constructed model can achieve high energy consumption data transmission security performance under the premise of ensuring the prediction accuracy, which can provide experimental basis for the prediction of energy consumption and the improvement of security maintenance performance in intelligent factories.},

We propose a software architecture for a Digital Twin that adaptively generates more accurate representations of its operations to detect malicious activities and mitigate their effects. To achieve this adaptivity, our solution leverages ML, time-series forecasting, concept drift detection and control stability analysis. To evaluate our solution, we develop a simulation of a simple industrial plant consisting of one PID-controlled steam-boiler and a variety of uncertainties. Our experimental evaluation suggests that Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control, a system identification technique, best contributes towards Self-Learning by producing verifiable models that better align the need for retraining with concept drifts.},

  abstract={Digital twin has the characteristics of high- fidelity behavior simulation, and deep learning has powerful data mining capabilities. Our country's port and hydraulic building facilities are now the world's largest, most of which are concrete structures. However, there will be more freeze-thaw damage to concrete structures, and there is less research on the durability test methods of hydraulic structures, especially the life prediction of hydraulic structures after freeze-thaw damage repairs. Based on this, this article has launched a research on the durability life prediction technology of port hydraulic structures driven by the integration of digital twins and deep learning. Aiming at the difficult problem of predicting and maintaining the status of port hydraulic buildings in a harsh working environment, combined with the high-fidelity behavior simulation characteristics of digital twins and the powerful data mining capabilities of deep learning, this paper mainly studies the mutual driving of digital twins and deep learning. In this paper, multiple digital twins of the shearer are constructed based on multiple physical and spatial parameters. Through multiple visual displays and data analysis in the virtual space, the health status is predicted, and a port based on deep machine learning is established. The residual life prediction model of the key parts of hydraulic structures realizes real-time monitoring on the network; integrates the residual life and residual life value of the building parts driven by data, and integrates the status of the digital twin and the residual life of the parts and the port Durability assessment of hydraulic construction buildings. The research results show that although a little steel slag can significantly improve the heat resistance and compressive strength of concrete, when the content of steel slag exceeds a certain meaning, the heat resistance and compressive strength of concrete will change. When the steel slag content reaches 10%, the effect is best. When the steel slag content reaches 20%, the 28d concrete compressive strength and strength will not have a big impact.},

  abstract={Semantic representation of motions in a human-robot collaborative environment is essential for agile design and development of digital twins (DT) towards ensuring efficient collaboration between humans and robots in hybrid work systems, e.g., in assembly operations. Dividing activities into actions helps to further conceptualize motion models for predicting what a human intends to do in a hybrid work system. However, it is not straightforward to identify human intentions in collaborative operations for robots to understand and collaborate. This paper presents a concept for semantic representation of human actions and intention prediction using a flexible task ontology interface in the semantic data hub stored in a domain knowledge base. This semantic data hub enables the construction of a DT with corresponding reasoning and simulation algorithms. Furthermore, a knowledge-based DT concept is used to analyze and verify the presented use-case of Human-Robot Collaboration in assembly operations. The preliminary evaluation showed a promising reduction of time for assembly tasks, which identifies the potential to i) improve efficiency reflected by reducing costs and errors and ultimately ii) assist human workers in improving decision making. Thus the contribution of the current work involves a marriage of machine learning, robotics, and ontology engineering into DT to improve human-robot interaction and productivity in a collaborative production environment.},
