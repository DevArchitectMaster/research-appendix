  abstract={One of the core model of the Tutor System is considered to be Student model, which pays special attention to student's cognitive and affective states and their evolution as the learning process advances. As the student works step-by-step through their problem solving process the system engages in a process called model tracing. Anytime the student model deviates from the domain model the system identifies, or flags, that an error has occurred. This helps in the shorter feedback cycle for the student and help them in overcoming these shortcomings through the recommendation engine. The tutor model accepts information from the domain and student models and makes choices about tutoring strategies and actions. At any point in the problem-solving process the learner may request guidance on what to do next, relative to their current location in the model. Knowledge tracing tracks the learner's progress from problem to problem and builds a profile of strengths and weaknesses relative to the production rules. The tutor system gives a visual graph of the learner's success in each of the monitored skills related to solving problems. When a learner requests a hint, or an error is flagged, the know ledge tracing data and the skill meter are updated in real-time. The Another core feature of the tutor system is its recommendation engine which on the basis of the skill meter that is updated at the real time will find what all are the things that the student may be interested on and suggest him the path that could be more fruitful. And last the tutor system is able to builds student profiles while observing student performance throughout the interaction of the system.},

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate various training methods for building deep neural network (DNN) based acoustic models for dysarthric speech data. Methods like multitask learning, knowledge distillation and model adaptation, which overcome data sparsity and model over-fitting problems are employed to study the merits of each method. In Knowledge distillation framework, some privilege information in addition to featurelabels pairs available only during training, is exploited to help the model learn better without using such previleged information during testing [1]; knowledge from one model can be distilled to another and thereby guiding it in learning better [2]. In this work, a DNN acoustic model trained using data pooled from Dysarthric speech data and parallel un-impaired data is used as the intelligent teacher while the student DNN model is trained using only Dysarthric speech. The target label for training the student model is a combination of hard aligned labels and those obtained from forward-pass through the teacher model. In addition to this technique, other knowledge sharing techniques like multitask learning were explored for Dysarthric speech data and have found to show a relative improvement of 11% over the corresponding baseline models.},

  title={An adaptive recommender-system based framework for personalised teaching and learning on e-learning platforms}, 
  year={2017},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={Current learning management systems such as Moodle and WebCT are considered as linear systems that provide e-learning material in a fixed-sequence, delivering the same content to learners regardless of their differences in background knowledge. For learners engaged in self-study online distance learning, this may result in material being presented at either too high or too low cognitive levels. According to the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory, this may result in either frustration or boredom among learners. This paper proposes a recommender-system-based adaptive e-learning framework for personalised teaching on e-learning platforms. The framework would assist designers, teachers and learners to identify issues they need to consider in order to address challenges of poor engagement in online distance settings, arising from a “one-size-fits-all” approach that does not recognise the role of individual differences in teaching and learning. Secondly, the framework may enable the identification of problems or obstacles that may be encountered when supporting learners in their quest to reduce frustration and boredom when using a Recommender-Based Pedagogical System (RBPS). A literature review was conducted on adaptive e-learning systems based on the ZPD theory, learner modelling, the Generic Adaptive Framework and a recommendation system model. 70 articles were selected from a database of 720 articles published between 2010 and 2017 to come up with the dimensions needed to develop such a model for the framework through deductive analysis. The research found out that the majority of the studies only consider three dimensions to an adaptive framework, that is, the learner model, the content model and the adaptation engine while the Generic Adaptation Framework proposes seven dimensions. In addition, the majority of the studies are based on the principles of macro-adaptation which provide a “static” snapshot of a learner's profile instead of dynamically adjusting the adaptation as learner variables. In the proposed adaptive framework, we identified five dimensions, including real-time dynamic adaptation and context modelling in addition to the learner model, the domain model and the pedagogical strategy.},

  abstract={The purpose of the article is to outline the futuristic vision of Industry 4.0 in intra-logistics by creating a hybrid network for research and technologies thereby providing a detailed account on the research centre, available technologies and their possibilities for collaboration. Scientific challenges in the field of Industry 4.0 and intra-logistics are identified due to the new form of interaction between humans and machines. This kind of collaboration provides new possibilities of materials handling that can be developed with the support of real-time motion data tracking and virtual reality systems. These services will be provided by a new research centre for flexible human-machine cooperation networks in Dortmund. By the use of various reference and experiment systems various real-time scenarios can be emulated including digital twin simulation concepts. Big data emerges as an important paradigm in this research project where all systems are made flexible in terms of networking for all the systems to consume the data produced and also to combine all the data to arrive at new insights using concepts from machine learning and deep learning networks. This leads to the challenge of finding a common syntax for inter-operating systems. This paper describes the design and deployment strategies of research centre with the possibilities and the design insights for a futuristic Industry 4.0 material handling facility.},

  abstract={One of the greatest challenges for computer science in education is the capacity to provide environments that are intelligent and adaptable to the real needs of students. In order to create efficient adaptive mechanisms for educational content, student models are proposed to identify and to predict the real knowledge level of students. Such models are useful not only for computer systems but also to assist students and instructors in the teaching-learning process so that such models may be visualized by them in an intuitive way. Thus, this study proposes the integration of information visualization tools aimed at creating an open student model that allows students and instructors to access the information inferred by the student model. For validation, the proposed model was implemented, integrated, and tested in a real ubiquitous learning environment. Results show users' satisfaction when such feature is available, as well as their perception about different visualizations.},

In order to solve this problem, one of the original goals of intelligent educational systems is to guide every student to the most appropriate educational contents. So, the approach adopted in this paper is based on a framework called ArCARE (Conceptual Framework of Educational Resources Adaptation in Virtual Learning Environments), which allows adaptation of resources for students in VLEs, allowing the construction of their knowledge, using multi-agent system technology that handles an open learner model ontology. These ArCARE resources are recommendation and adaptation of collaborative activities such as Pedagogical Architectures for the students have a more effective learning of particular course content.

Hanini and Jabari et al. modeled the text in chat sessions, but there is still a problem when using Arabic, because the Arabic language is very difficult to comprehend, has complex derivative and many ambiguities. This paper enhanced the previous study and added MADAMIRA tool to analyze the Arabic text. Monitoring and modeling has been completed through the text modeling process by evaluating the student expressions within the chat session using MADAMIRA tool and machine learning. MADAMIRA tool enables the modeling process to categorize Arabic text into different categories, which makes it easier to use the levels of the used expressions and discover the importance of the chat session between two peers. The process of the student modeling using MADAMIRA and Machine learning will update the student model which gathers information about the student achievements within the AVCM.},

  abstract={The application of machine learning models to the analysis of network measurement problems has largely increased in the last decade; however, there is still no clear best-practice or silver bullet approach to address these problems in a general context, and only adhoc and tailored approaches have been evaluated so far. While deep-learning models have provided a major breakthrough in highly-dimensional problems such as image processing, it is difficult to say today which is the best model to address the analysis of large volumes of highly-dimensional data collected in operational networks. In this paper we present a potential solution to fill this gap, exploring the application of ensemble learning models to multiple network measurement problems. We introduce GML Learning, a generic Machine Learning model for the analysis of network measurements. The GML model is a generalization of the well-known stacking approach to ensemble learning, and follows the concepts of the Super Learner model. The Super Learner performs asymptotically as well as the best input base or weak learners, providing a very powerful approach to tackle multiple problems with the same technique. In addition, it defines an approach to minimize over-fitting likelihood during training, using a variant of cross-validation. We deploy the GML model on top of Big-DAMA, a big data analytics framework for network measurement applications. We test the proposed solution in five different and assorted network measurement problems, including detection of network attacks and anomalies, QoE modeling and prediction, and Internet-paths dynamics tracking. Results confirm that the GML model provides better results than any of the single baseline models of the stack, and outperforms traditional bagging and boosting ensemble learning approaches. The GML Learning model opens the door for a generalization of a best-practice technique for the analysis of network measurements.},

  abstract={Driven by the challenges of rapid urbanization, cities are determined to implement advanced socio-technological changes and transform into smarter cities. The success of such transformation, however, greatly relies on a thorough understanding of the city's states of spatiotemporal flux. The ability to understand such fluctuations in context and in terms of interdependencies that exist among various entities across time and space is crucial, if cities are to maintain their smart growth. Here, we introduce a Smart City Digital Twin paradigm that can enable increased visibility into cities' human-infrastructure-technology interactions, in which spatiotemporal fluctuations of the city are integrated into an analytics platform at the real-time intersection of reality-virtuality. Through learning and exchange of spatiotemporal information with the city, enabled through virtualization and the connectivity offered by Internet of Things (IoT), this Digital Twin of the city becomes smarter over time, able to provide predictive insights into the city's smarter performance and growth.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks have shown significant success across various applications. To solve the complex problems, the increasing depth and complexity pose the challenges of large computation and storage requirements when deploying such networks on embedded devices with limited storage and power. Many techniques have been developed by researchers to compress the deep neural networks to make them deployable on portable devices by reducing the storage requirements. This paper describes the implementation of deep neural network with teacher student model. A comparatively smaller student model learns the information passed from the larger teacher model without losing the accuracy and its learning/inference rate is also improved. So this kind of framework is suitable for embedded applications deployment where real-time performance is required.},

However, since all subjects in the experiments were in the field of computer science, it is not yet known if KM-ReAct can help students in other research areas obtain suitable know-how.

  abstract={Mobile learning in massive open online course (MOOC) evidently differs from its traditional ways as it relies more on collaborations and becomes more fragmented. We present a cloud-based virtual learning environment (VLE) which can organize learners into a better teamwork context and customize micro learning resources in order to meet personal demands in real time. Particularly, a smart micro learning environment was built by a newly designed Software as a Service (SaaS), namely Micro Learning as a Service (MLaaS). It aims to provide adaptive micro learning contents as well as learning path identifications customized for each individual learner. To personalize the micro learning, a dynamic learner model is constructed with regards to the internal and external factors that can affect learning experience and outcomes. Educational data mining (EDM) techniques are employed as the main method to understand learners' behaviors and recognize learning resource features. A solution of learning path optimization is also proposed towards assembling a complete MOOC learning experience.},

The approach is grounded in control theory and capitalizes on recent work by [4]  , [5] that frames the teaching problem as that of finding approximately optimal teaching policies for approximately optimal learners (AOTAOL). Our work expands on [4] , [5] in several ways: (1) We develop a novel student model in which the teacher's actions can partially  eliminate hypotheses about the curriculum. (2) With our student model, inference can be conducted  analytically rather than numerically, thus allowing computationally efficient planning to optimize learning. (3) We develop a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical control technique that allows the teaching policy to search through deeper learning trajectories. We demonstrate our approach in a novel ITS for foreign language learning similar to Rosetta Stone and show that the automatically generated AOTAOL teaching policy performs favorably compared to two hand-crafted teaching policies.},

  pages={621-636},
  abstract={The recent advances in mobile technologies have resulted in Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled devices becoming more pervasive and integrated into our daily lives. The security challenges that need to be overcome mainly stem from the open nature of a wireless medium, such as a Wi-Fi network. An impersonation attack is an attack in which an adversary is disguised as a legitimate party in a system or communications protocol. The connected devices are pervasive, generating high-dimensional data on a large scale, which complicates simultaneous detections. Feature learning, however, can circumvent the potential problems that could be caused by the large-volume nature of network data. This paper thus proposes a novel deep-feature extraction and selection (D-FES), which combines stacked feature extraction and weighted feature selection. The stacked autoencoding is capable of providing representations that are more meaningful by reconstructing the relevant information from its raw inputs. We then combine this with modified weighted feature selection inspired by an existing shallow-structured machine learner. We finally demonstrate the ability of the condensed set of features to reduce the bias of a machine learner model as well as the computational complexity. Our experimental results on a well-referenced Wi-Fi network benchmark data set, namely, the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion data set, prove the usefulness and the utility of the proposed D-FES by achieving a detection accuracy of 99.918% and a false alarm rate of 0.012%, which is the most accurate detection of impersonation attacks reported in the literature.},

  pages={866-871},
  abstract={One of the challenges in adaptive learning systems is to manage learner models that include learners' profiles and activities and interaction between learners and the learning tools. In the context of lifelong learning, the learner model is a user learning pattern, which can be modelled all the time based on user interaction with various sources. The main issue in lifelong learner model design is what type of information needs to be stored in the learner model and how the information granularity is involved. The type and level of information granularity of a user will determine how appropriate the pedagogical policies are to be provided by the system for a user. Lifelong learner model design should be in line with the principles of lifelong learning, namely sociality, interoperability, and scrutability. This paper discusses our research on learner model ontology for lifelong learning. The goal expected to be achieved is that there is a lifelong learner model ontology to be accessed and updated by adaptive learning systems. This research classifies learners' attributes into two groups, which are static and dynamic attributes. Static attributes tend not to change or very rarely change. They include learner's profile, special needs, aptitude, preference, learning approach, learning style, personality, and cognitive capability. On the other hand, dynamic attributes include learning history and study plan. Through conducting some experiments, it can be concluded that LifeOn supports ubiquitous and lifelong learning, and can be used in adaptive learning systems with various learner models.},

Numerous concepts using augmented reality technologies have been developed to offer support in manual assembly processes.

However, wearable devices offer only limited computational power and limited flexibility of their interface platform. This poses a challenge to heavy data transactions from various different sources and restrict the use for real-time responses, which are often necessary for applications in a factory. To overcome this limitation, the author of this paper proposes a combination of wearable devices with edge devices located on the shop floor. An augmented reality platform was constructed with modularized services by using the digital twin of the machine components and machine learning algorithms for object recognition. This is integrated in the factory environment to synchronize real machine components with their digital twin.},

  abstract={In this article we present our approach of intelligent tutoring systems which is based on adaptive workflows. The main idea is to use workflows for learning and assessment process. In fact, our goal is to have a system that could combine the existence of an intelligent tutor to carry out the tasks of teachers in the teaching process and a human tutor who takes part in the monitoring, control and follow-up of the execution of self-learning processes models in order to check out the learner path and to resolve blocking and demotivating situations of the learners. Our model use parameters provided by the adopted learner model especially, student knowledge and preferences, and teaching domain model to propose the optimal pedagogical workflow for each learner to reach his didactical objective. This pedagogical process will be adapted during its execution in the workflow engine by using some parameters of student interaction with the system. We aim also to make the evaluation process more fun and non-stressful by introducing pedagogical games in assessment process in order to motivate students to learn and make the learning process a mean to succeed the game.},

  title={Online Tracker Optimization for Multi-Pedestrian Tracking Using a Moving Vehicle Camera}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={6},
  number={},
  pages={48675-48687},
  abstract={Multi-pedestrian tracking (MPT) on the road is closely related to a reduction in the possibility of pedestrian-vehicle collisions when using advanced driver assistance systems. Therefore, this paper focuses on MPT on real roads using a moving camera. Although convolutional neural network (CNN)-based single object tracking methods have recently been proposed, the online learning of CNN for MPT is a significant burden in terms of real-time processing. However, because the features extracted from CNN are a good representation and achieve a high generalization capability, to reduce the learning time, a shallow pre-trained CNN was applied in the present study as a feature extractor instead of an object tracker As an online tracker, this study uses random ferns (RF) with pre-trained CNN output feature, which can make the problem computationally tractable and robustness. However, a large RF requires significant amount of memory and computational complexity, and is still a burden in terms of online learning in cases of multi-pedestrian tracking. Therefore, we introduce a teacher-student model compression algorithm for selecting a few optimal ferns for each tracker, thereby, reducing the online learning time. The online learning of a student-RF tracker has an advantage in that it can adaptively update the tracker to achieve robustness against various changes, such as in pose and illumination, and partial occlusions within a limited period of time. The proposed algorithm was successfully applied to benchmark video sequences captured from a moving camera that include multiple pedestrians in various poses. Specifically, the proposed algorithm yields a more accurate tracking performance than the other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={This paper presents our exploration into teacher-student (TS) training for acoustic models (AMs) based on the lattice-free maximum mutual information technique. Whereas most previous studies of TS training used a frame-level distance between teacher and student models' distributions, we propose using the sequence-level temper-atured Kullback-Leibler divergence as a metric for TS training. In our experiment on the AMI meeting corpus, we prepared a strong teacher model consisting of a convolutional neural network, time delay neural network, and long short-term memory, which had 47.7M parameters and achieved a state-of-the-art word error rate (WER) of 18.05%. Whereas the small student AM (10.8M params. and 19.72% WER) trained by a frame-level TS training was able to fill only 43% of the WER gap between teacher and student AMs, the student AM trained by the proposed method achieved a 18.23% WER, filling 89% of the WER gap from the teacher AM. We also show that the frame-level TS training sometimes even degrades the performance of the student model whereas the proposed method consistently improved the accuracy.},

  year={2018},
  volume={},

  pages={5949-5953},
  abstract={The teacher-student (T/S) learning has been shown effective in unsupervised domain adaptation [1]. It is a form of transfer learning, not in terms of the transfer of recognition decisions, but the knowledge of posteriori probabilities in the source domain as evaluated by the teacher model. It learns to handle the speaker and environment variability inherent in and restricted to the speech signal in the target domain without proactively addressing the robustness to other likely conditions. Performance degradation may thus ensue. In this work, we advance T/S learning by proposing adversarial T/S learning to explicitly achieve condition-robust unsupervised domain adaptation. In this method, a student acoustic model and a condition classifier are jointly optimized to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the output distributions of the teacher and student models, and simultaneously, to min-maximize the condition classification loss. A condition-invariant deep feature is learned in the adapted student model through this procedure. We further propose multi-factorial adversarial T/S learning which suppresses condition variabilities caused by multiple factors simultaneously. Evaluated with the noisy CHiME-3 test set, the proposed methods achieve relative word error rate improvements of 44.60% and 5.38%, respectively, over a clean source model and a strong T/S learning baseline model.},

  abstract={Supervised classification and spectral unmixing are two methods to extract information from hyperspectral images. However, despite their complementarity, they have been scarcely considered jointly. This paper presents a new hierarchical Bayesian model to perform simultaneously both analysis in order to ensure that they benefit from each other. A linear mixture model is proposed to described the pixel measurements. Then a clustering is performed to identify groups of statistically similar abundance vectors. A Markov random field (MRF) is used as prior for the corresponding cluster labels. It promotes a spatial regularization through a Potts-Markov potential and also includes a local potential induced by the classification. Finally, the classification exploits a set of possibly corrupted labeled data provided by the end-user. Model parameters are estimated thanks to a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The interest of the proposed model is illustrated on synthetic and real data.},

A learning algorithm is presented to implement DeepSCNs with either specific architecture or self- organization. The read-out weights attached with all direct links from each hidden layer to the output layer are evaluated by the least squares method. Given a set of training examples, DeepSCNs can speedily produce a learning representation, that is, a collection of random basis functions with the cascaded inputs together with the read-out weights. An empirical demonstration on a function approximation and a case study are carried out to demonstrate some properties of the proposed deep learner model.},

  pages={33-40},
  abstract={A user model is a collection and categorization of personal data associated with a specific user. With the development of personal computers, the usage of the user model has been evolving in the past 40 years. In the early age of the computer, as a part of computer application, one user model could only be used for a single domain, such as the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the education support. With the increase of many different applications, a user model was separated from its specific computer application to support the cross-domain usage for multiple applications. The emergence of the Internet made the user model to be the users' specific representation on a single social platform for the identification by other users. In the foreseeable future, the user model will become a common representation for its user via multiple social platforms. Theoretically, a unique, digital, comprehensive description of every human individual, namely Cyber Individual (Cyber-I) may exist on the Internet. In this paper, we first focus on approaches to build up the Cyber-I model in comparison to the user model, in terms of model representations, architectures of modeling system and modeling techniques. We then summarize our previous works related to Cyber-I modeling, e.g., the personal data collection, the Cyber-I modeling architecture, and the modeling process. Finally, we present major issues that should be solved for the future development of Cyber-I model and modeling.},

  abstract={User feedback allows for tailoring system operation to ensure individual user satisfaction. A major challenge in personalized decision-making is the systematic construction of a user model during operation while maintaining control performance. This paper presents both an index-based control policy to smartly collect and process user feedback and a user comfort model in the form of a Markov decision process with a priori unknown user-specific state transition probabilities. The control policy utilizes explicit user feedback to optimize a reward measure reflecting user comfort and addresses the explorationexploitation trade-off in a multi-armed bandit framework. The proposed approach combines restless bandits and upper confidence bound algorithms. It introduces an exploration term into the restless bandit formulation, utilizes user feedback to identify the user model, and is shown to be indexable. We demonstrate its capabilities with a simulation for learning a user's trade-off between comfort and energy usage.},

In this paper, we use a teacher-student learning approach to achieve this goal, where a new objective function is proposed to match the extracted CNN feature sequences of the teacher and student models under the guidance of the succeeding LSTM layer. Experimental results on large scale English HWR and OCR tasks show that the learned small student model can achieve about 14.6x footprint reduction and 9.6x speedup without recognition accuracy degradation against the big teacher model.},

As an important part of the general model, the student model reflects the individual characteristics, knowledge status and cognitive ability of the students. The traditional student model judges students based solely on the student’s basic information and simple test scores. This paper proposes a CD-CAT hybrid model based on the actual scene of the learner, retains the original static question bank, and dynamically updates the student model based on the test database of the learner’s different knowledge structure. The knowledge field is divided into multiple categories, and the dynamic allocation of the question bank between categories is carried out. After testing, this dynamic model has a good effect.},

  abstract={In this paper, we tackle the region selection task for the purpose of whole slide image (WSI) analysis with a focus on Gram stained slides. Typically, the number of tiles required to capture using high magnification objective is extremely large. Thus, in practice, we need to perform region of interest selection in low magnification objectives to choose only the best candidate regions for the later high magnification analysis. With the fast development of computer vision and deep learning, it is possible to train an accurate convolutional neural network (CNN) based classifier to do this region selection task which would normally be done by experienced scientists and pathologists. However, data collection and labelling during the training stage are very time-consuming, labour intensive and expensive tasks. Researchers starting to ask a much more challenging question: how can we use unlabeled data to boost the system performance? In this paper, to answer this question and to reduce labelling effort, we propose a data distillation training framework to train a CNN classifier on limited labeled data with the help of unlabeled data. The unlabeled data will be carefully selected by a teacher model via a data distillation process and put into the training set for a student model. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework achieves a notable gain in accuracy.},

  abstract={Nowadays, more and more people of different ages play digital games. The multimedia, like video, animations, audio and interactive content, that the digital games use, make them more impressive, almost magical. They cause enthusiasm and pleasant feelings to users-players. Therefore, they can be used to motivate students to participate in learning processes. That is the reason why educational digital games has become a burning issue. However, some users-players deal with difficulties during the game playing. For example, they may have difficulties in solving a puzzle, crossing a labyrinth, finding a hidden object, or defeating in a battle etc. As a result, they are disappointed and are drawn away from the game's educational goal. Therefore, in the presented paper, a stereotype-based user model, which identifies the abilities and difficulties that a particular user-player has during the game playing, is presented. A user model is able to highlight the user's individual needs and specific characteristics in order to offer personalization. The presented user model provides the game the ability to be adapted to each particular player's needs and abilities, making the playing process more fascinating and allowing the player to focus on the learning process and the educational goal. Furthermore, the paper presents examples of operation. Also, the system has been evaluated and the evaluation results are very encouraging.},

  abstract={Nowadays, intelligent and expert systems and applications have become a burning issue. In the scientific literature, it seems to be of particular interest to provide educational applications and systems with “intelligence”, in order to be able to adapt either the learning material or the tutoring and learning processes to each individual student's needs. The module of student model is crucial for offering a personalized learning experience to each particular student. Student modeling has been introduced in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), but it's use has been extended to most current educational software applications that aim to be adaptive and personalized. Student modeling is able to highlight students individual needs, learning characteristics, knowledge level, errors or misconceptions etc. However, building a student model is a complex process. In this paper, a novel web service API, which creates platform-independent and technological-independent student models using the technology of web services, is presented. The presented API is called FSP Creator. Its innovative operation relies on the facts that the created student profile i) can be embedded in any educational application (web, mobile, game), regardless of the system's technological characteristics or programming language, ii) can be recognized by all the different applications that use it and call the same web services. Furthermore, the created student profile is based on fuzzy logic sets that are used by a Fuzzy Rule System incorporated in FSP Creator and used for selecting the appropriate learning material and exercises. However, each application that uses the created student profile can extend the fuzzy rule set or use its own fuzzy rule set as desired. For the description of the operations of FSP Creator, we have used three different educational applications (two games and one web-based educational application) that have used the fuzzy student profile, which has been created by the presented API.},

  abstract={Symbiotic simulation is one of Industry 4.0 technologies that enables interaction between a physical system and the simulation model that represents it as its digital twin. Symbiotic simulation is designed to support decision making at the operational levels by making use of real- or near real- time data that is generated by the physical system, which is used as an input to the simulation model. From the modeling perspective, a symbiotic simulation system comprises a hybrid systems model that combines simulation, optimization and machine learning models as well as a data acquisition module and an actuator. The actuator is needed when the symbiotic simulation system is designed to directly control the physical system without human intervention. This paper reviews the components of a symbiotic simulation system from the perspective of hybrid systems modeling and highlights research questions needed to advance symbiotic simulation study.},

  pages={29-35},
  abstract={Non-native speech causes automatic speech recognition systems to degrade in performance. Past strategies to address this challenge have considered model adaptation, accent classification with a model selection, alternate pronunciation lexicon, etc. In this study, we consider a recurrent neural network (RNN) with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) cost function trained on multi-accent English data including US (Native), Indian and Hispanic accents. We exploit dark knowledge from a model trained with the multi-accent data to train student models under the guidance of both a teacher model and CTC cost of target transcription. We show that transferring knowledge from a single RNN-CTC trained model toward a student model, yields better performance than the stand-alone teacher model. Since the outputs of different trained CTC models are not necessarily aligned, it is not possible to simply use an ensemble of CTC teacher models. To address this problem, we train accent specific models under the guidance of a single multi-accent teacher, which results in having multiple aligned and trained CTC models. Furthermore, we train a student model under the supervision of the accent-specific teachers, resulting in an even further complementary model, which achieves +20.1% relative Character Error Rate (CER) reduction compared to the baseline trained without any teacher. Having this effective multi-accent model, we can achieve further improvement for each accent by adapting the model to each accent. Using the accent specific model's outputs to regularize the adapting process (i.e., a knowledge distillation version of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence) results in even superior performance compared to the conventional approach using general teacher models.},

  pages={1-13},
  abstract={Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is accompanied by a variety of technologies which offer great potential for optimizing the manufacturing of electric motors. However, the application of I4.0 technologies in this sector has hardly been examined yet. For determining I4.0 potentials in the electric motor production, a structured approach is required since the variety of sub-processes and production technologies results in a vast number of possible combinations. Therefore, this paper first compares different generic approaches for identifying, selecting and implementing I4.0 use cases. Building on this, a methodical approach is derived in order to tap the numerous I4.0 potentials within the electric motor production. On the one hand, use cases can be derived from current technological opportunities resulting from application examples and best practices in research and industry. On the other hand, concrete problems in critical manufacturing processes can give rise to the application of novel I4.0 solutions. By presenting a comprehensive overview of promising application scenarios, this paper mainly facilitates the identification of I4.0 potentials in the electric motor production from an opportunity-driven perspective. In addition to approaches directly addressing the electric motor production, concepts can be derived from related processes in other application domains. Examples are provided by outlining a selection of the presumably most relevant use cases. The results indicate that especially data-driven approaches, i.e. data analytics and machine learning, offer great potential in electric motor production. As an outlook, I4.0 potentials can also be disclosed from a problem-pull perspective, supplementing the opportunity-push approach of this paper.},

In general, teachers develop the material that is to be taught and organize pedagogical activities for the students. As a consequence, students have a learning environment that does not take into account activities that have already been completed, actions taken, learning preferences and cognitive profile. Activities and teaching materials in robotic environments are the same for all students, and may end up being insufficient for the effective learning of each one. The initial search of four main academic databases resulted in 137 papers out of which 15 papers were included in the final analysis. Our article presents different researches, which involve adapting content for learning in robotic environments.},

  abstract={This paper discusses a Digital Twin demonstrator for privacy enhancement in the automotive industry. Here, the Digital Twin demonstrator is presented as a method for the design and implementation of privacy enhancement mechanisms, and is used to detect privacy concerns and minimize breaches and associated risks to which smart car drivers can be exposed through connected infotainment applications and services. The Digital Twin-based privacy enhancement demonstrator is designed to simulate variety of conditions that can occur in the smart car ecosystem. We firstly identify the core stakeholders (actors) in the smart car ecosystem, their roles and exposure to privacy vulnerabilities and associated risks. Secondly, we identify assets that consume and generate sensitive privacy data in smart cars, their functionalities, and relevant privacy concerns and risks. Thirdly, we design an infrastructure for collecting (i) real-time sensor data from smart cars and their assets, and (ii) environmental data, road and traffic data, generated through operational driving lifecycle. In order to ensure compliance of the collected data with privacy policies and regulations, e.g. with GDPR requirements for enforcement of the data subject's rights, we design methods for the Digital Twin-based privacy enhancement demonstrator that are based on behavioural analytics informed by GDPR. We also perform data anonymization to minimize privacy risks and enable actions such as sending an automatic informed consent to the stakeholders.},

  abstract={This paper presents a Bayesian user model able to learn and estimate user characteristics in a distributed manner using heterogeneous information. A unified user representation is obtained from an inference process, receiving a set of independently estimated user characteristics from different sources. The independence of characteristic models enables the system to be modular, with each module estimating one characteristic. The proposed model is iterative, fusing new observations, and measurements with previous information in a process regulated entropy. The system allows diverse implementations, such as the combination of multiple robots with a cloud infrastructure or distributed ambient sensors. This paper aims to enable the system to perform online learning while interacting with users. The system is also able to obtain a correct user representation from heterogeneous information, even when some user characteristics cannot be computed. To demonstrate its functionality, the system is tested on two experimental datasets, obtained from simulated experiments and with real users. This technique advances the state of the art in the areas of AAL and user-adaptive systems, and in cloud-connected robots and Internet of Things, allowing for these heterogeneous and naturally distributed teams of devices to better model their users, potentially achieving higher interaction autonomy.},

  abstract={Digital twin is a significant way to achieve smart manufacturing, and provides a new paradigm for fault diagnosis. Traditional data-based fault diagnosis methods mostly assume that the training data and test data are following the same distribution and can acquire sufficient data to train a reliable diagnosis model, which is unrealistic in the dynamic changing production process. In this paper, we present a two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method using deep transfer learning (DFDD), which realizes fault diagnosis both in the development and maintenance phases. At first, the potential problems that are not considered at design time can be discovered through front running the ultra-high-fidelity model in the virtual space, while a deep neural network (DNN)-based diagnosis model will be fully trained. In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as avoids wasting time and knowledge. A case study about fault diagnosis using DFDD in a car body-side production line is presented. The results show the superiority and feasibility of our proposed method.},

  abstract={Specifying complex task behaviors while ensuring good robot performance may be difficult for untrained users. We study a framework for users to specify rules for acceptable behavior in a shared environment such as industrial facilities. As non-expert users might have little intuition about how their specification impacts the robot's performance, we design a learning system that interacts with users to find an optimal solution. Using active preference learning, we iteratively show alternative paths that the robot could take on an interface. From the user feedback on ranking the alternatives, we learn about the weights that users place on each part of their specification. We extend the user model from our previous work to a discrete Bayesian learning model and introduce a greedy algorithm for proposing alternative that operates on the notion of equivalence regions of user weights. We prove that using this algorithm, the revision active learning process converges on the user-optimal path. Using simulations performed in realistic industrial environments, we demonstrate the convergence and robustness of our approach.},

  abstract={Privacy protection is considered as an important problem in learning-based systems. Recently, various works based on differential privacy have been proposed to protect an individual's privacy in the machine learning and deep learning contexts. One of the state-of-the-art approaches is Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE), a generic framework which can be successfully applied to many different learning algorithms. In PATE, we need to split the private dataset into many disjoint subsets and train an ensemble of teachers on these subsets. Then, we transfer noisy predictions from the ensemble of teachers to a student model. In this paper, we show that for complex datasets and tasks, such as nature image classification, the training set allocated for one teacher may be too small with respect to the corresponding task to achieve an ideal performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose the TrPATE framework which extends PATE with transfer learning. Based on PATE, we transfer and share the knowledge extracted from a publicly available non-private dataset to the teachers. The extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets, and the empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

However, conventional teacher-student methods use fixed pre-trained teacher models, that makes it difficult to optimize student models. In this paper, rather than using a fixed pre-trained teacher model, we investigate an interactive teacher-student learning by adjusting the teacher model with reference to the performance of the student model when the student model is stuck in a local minimum. Experiments on a 10-language LID task were carried out to test the algorithm. Our results showed its effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on short utterance LID tasks.},

  abstract={Deep speaker embedding learning is an effective method for speaker identity modelling. Very deep models such as ResNet can achieve remarkable results but are usually too computationally expensive for real applications with limited resources. On the other hand, simply reducing model size is likely to result in significant performance degradation. In this paper, label-level and embedding-level knowledge distillation are proposed to narrow down the performance gap between large and small models. Label-level distillation utilizes the posteriors obtained by a well-trained teacher model to guide the optimization of the student model, while embedding-level distillation directly constrains the similarity between embeddings learned by two models. Experiments were carried out on the VoxCeleb1 dataset. Results show that the proposed knowledge distillation methods can significantly boost the performance of highly compact student models.},

  abstract={Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have seen great progress in classifying images. Action recognition is different from still image classification; video data contains temporal information that plays an important role in video understanding. Currently, most CNN-based approaches for action recognition have excessive computational costs, with an explosion of parameters and computation time. The currently most efficient method trains a deep network directly on compressed video containing the motion information. However, this method has a large number of parameters. We propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework for compressed video action recognition to compress this model. With this framework, the model is compressed by transferring the knowledge from multiple teachers to a single small student model. With multi-teacher knowledge distillation, students learn better than with single-teacher knowledge distillation. Experiments show that we can reach a 2.4× compression rate in a number of parameters and a 1.2× computation reduction with 1.79% loss of accuracy on the UCF-101 dataset and 0.35% loss of accuracy on the HMDB51 dataset.},

Recent acoustic event detectors are based on large-scale neural networks, which are typically trained with huge amounts of labeled data. Labels for acoustic events are expensive to obtain, and relevant acoustic event audios can be limited, especially for rare events. In this paper we leverage an Internet-scale un-labeled dataset with potential domain shift to improve the detection of acoustic events. Based on the classic tri-training approach, our proposed method shows accuracy improvement over both the supervised training baseline, and semi-supervised self-training set-up, in all pre-defined acoustic event detection tasks. As our approach relies on ensemble models, we further show the improvements can be distilled to a single model via knowledge distillation, with the resulting single student model maintaining high accuracy of teacher ensemble models.},

  year={2019},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={6445-6449},
  abstract={The teacher-student (T/S) learning has been shown to be effective for a variety of problems such as domain adaptation and model compression. One shortcoming of the T/S learning is that a teacher model, not always perfect, sporadically produces wrong guidance in form of posterior probabilities that misleads the student model towards a suboptimal performance. To overcome this problem, we propose a conditional T/S learning scheme, in which a "smart" student model selectively chooses to learn from either the teacher model or the ground truth labels conditioned on whether the teacher can correctly predict the ground truth. Unlike a naive linear combination of the two knowledge sources, the conditional learning is exclusively engaged with the teacher model when the teacher model's prediction is correct, and otherwise backs off to the ground truth. Thus, the student model is able to learn effectively from the teacher and even potentially surpass the teacher. We examine the proposed learning scheme on two tasks: domain adaptation on CHiME-3 dataset and speaker adaptation on Microsoft short message dictation dataset. The proposed method achieves 9.8% and 12.8% relative word error rate reductions, respectively, over T/S learning for environment adaptation and speaker-independent model for speaker adaptation.},

  abstract={Large scale machine learning (ML) systems such as the Alexa automatic speech recognition (ASR) system continue to improve with increasing amounts of manually transcribed training data. Instead of scaling manual transcription to impractical levels, we utilize semi-supervised learning (SSL) to learn acoustic models (AM) from the vast firehose of untranscribed audio data. Learning an AM from 1 Million hours of audio presents unique ML and system design challenges. We present the design and evaluation of a highly scalable and resource efficient SSL system for AM. Employing the student/teacher learning paradigm, we focus on the student learning subsystem: a scalable and robust data pipeline that generates features and targets from raw audio, and an efficient model pipeline, including the distributed trainer, that builds a student model. Our evaluations show that, even without extensive hyper-parameter tuning, we obtain relative accuracy improvements in the 10 to 20% range, with higher gains in noisier conditions. The end-toend processing time of this SSL system was 12 days, and several components in this system can trivially scale linearly with more compute resources.},

  abstract={An increasing number of power transformers operating in the developed countries do not have OEM technical support. There is an urgent need to obtain transformer design information such as winding types through interpretation of measured FRA data. Winding types may be manifested as different features in FRA traces within specific frequency ranges. The objective of this paper is to identify the winding type via FRA measurement data in order to help manage transformer assets. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are supervised learning models for classification analysis in machine learning. Given a set of training FRA examples with known winding categories, an SVM algorithm is built to assign new FRA traces to a most possible winding category. A group of 400/275 kV transformers are tested in this study with excellent classification results of winding types, indicating a promising “digital twin” technological approach to transformer asset management.},

  abstract={Click-through rate (CTR) is a key signal of relevance for search engine results, both organic and sponsored. CTR of a result has two core components: (a) the probability of examination of a result by a user, and (b) the perceived relevance of the result given that it has been examined by the user. There has been considerable work on user browsing models, to model and analyze both the examination and the relevance components of CTR. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation: a micro-browsing model for how users read result snippets. The snippet text of a result often plays a critical role in the perceived relevance of the result. We study how particular words within a line of snippet can influence user behavior. We validate this new micro-browsing user model by considering the problem of predicting which snippet will yield higher CTR, and show that classification accuracy is dramatically higher with our micro-browsing user model. The key insight in this paper is that varying relatively few words within a snippet, and even their location within a snippet, can have a significant influence on the clickthrough of a snippet.},

  year={2019},

  abstract={This study implements deep learning techniques to estimate fuel burn of a jet aircraft. Current ground-based flight planning systems utilize aircraft type specific performance tables to determine fuel flows for given flight conditions and parameters such as altitude, mass and speed. These tables are corrected by a performance factor as the aircraft ages. Despite this update, planned fuel consumption may indeed not overlap with the actual one. In order to synchronize the base aircraft model with aircraft's actual performance, we propose using state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for building data-driven models of fuel flows. Towards this goal, aircraft's on-board recorded trajectory and parameter data, namely Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data are utilized. The total dataset used within this study comprises of more than 1000 B777-300ER flights from a major European flag carrier airline. The deep neural network architecture is utilized for modeling the actual fuel flow specific to each aircraft and for each major flight mode (climb, cruise and descent namely). We have developed three neural network architectures (according to in-flight and ground based planning use cases) to present a tail-number specific correction factor to Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) models. First architecture involves a QAR data based black-box fuel flow model utilizing in-flight throttle data from all the engines. Comparison of this model with real flight data shows that precise estimation of fuel flow with mean errors lower than %0.1 can be achieved. The second architecture utilizes a physically consistent data regeneration of δT (delta thrust) using BADA formulation as to account for the ground planning phase where throttle information is not available. The third model involves a cascaded architecture which utilizes a neural network throttle estimator and the black-box QAR fuel flow model for again the ground planning phase. Comparison of the latter models with real flight data shows that precise estimation of fuel flow with mean absolute errors lower than %0.7 can be achieved at all the flight modes. Initial tests reflect the fact that even better accuracy can be achieved for all models as the data set size increases. Finally, ground based planning fuel flow models are applied to actual flight plans generated by ground based systems. Total trip fuel comparisons show discrepancies up to %3.5 total fuel loading weight, which may result in potential fuel savings by decreasing the fuel load during take-off. Comparison of the planned and the estimated fuel boarding weights (following the actual filed flight plans) for 91 long-haul flights show that fuel burn savings of around 800 [k g] per flight could have been achieved by the proposed methodology at the ground planning phase. For a typical operation of 100 long-haul flights per day, this represents yearly savings on the order of around 17 million USD at current jet fuel prices. This “tail-number specific” performance modeling approach is projected to open considerable frontiers including the in-flight update of performance models through machine learning methods.},

  abstract={Estimation of user perceived quality of offered services, from massive number of Key Performance Indicator (KPI)'s that are measured in diverse components, has been a necessity for mobile network operators. The goal is first to have a good estimator for poor Quality of Experience (QoE), which can potentially be achieved with machine learning, and then pinpoint the features that are contributing to the poor performance. There is often a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability of models. In this paper, we address this tradeoff by first developing a robust but complex teacher machine learning model to map the subjective Net Promoter Score (NPS) values computed from the user quality feedback to the underlying subset of KPI metrics. Next, we develop a rather interpretable student model supervised by the pre-trained teacher model. Eventually the compact student decision tree model learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher model with an at least 10 % improved accuracy in testset as compared to conventional way of directly training using the decision tree model. In the last step, we extract the rules and important influential features of the distilled student model.},

  abstract={Combining global user and product characteristics with local review information provides a powerful mechanism for predicting users' sentiment in a review document about a product on online review sites such as Amazon, Yelp and IMDB. However, the user information is not always available in the real scenario, for example, some new-registered users, or some sites allowing users' comments without logging in. To address this issue, we introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) learning paradigm, to transfer the user characteristics into the weights of student neural networks that just utilize product and review information. The teacher model transfers its predictive distributions of training data to the student model. Thus, the user profiles are only required during the training stage. Experimental results on several sentiment classification datasets show that the proposed learning framework enables student models to achieve improved performance.},

  abstract={In this paper, we consider a mobile edge computing system with both ultra-reliable and low-latency communications services and delay tolerant services. We aim to minimize the normalized energy consumption, defined as the energy consumption per bit, by optimizing user association, resource allocation, and offloading probabilities subject to the quality-of-service requirements. The user association is managed by the mobility management entity (MME), while resource allocation and offloading probabilities are determined by each access point (AP). We propose a deep learning (DL) architecture, where a digital twin of the real network environment is used to train the DL algorithm off-line at a central server. From the pre-trained deep neural network (DNN), the MME can obtain user association scheme in a real-time manner. Considering that the real networks are not static, the digital twin monitors the variation of real networks and updates the DNN accordingly. For a given user association scheme, we propose an optimization algorithm to find the optimal resource allocation and offloading probabilities at each AP. The simulation results show that our method can achieve lower normalized energy consumption with less computation complexity compared with an existing method and approach to the performance of the global optimal solution.},

  abstract={Adaptive e-learning promises to deal with the problems of not considering learner characteristics experienced in e-learning systems. Research has shown that adaptive e-learning improves the effectiveness of e-learning systems and removes the loneliness experienced by learners when they are online. Though this is the case, adaptive e-learning systems face the challenge of not only utilizing one learner characteristic to provide adaptation but also the problem of deciding which learner characteristic to model. This study was carried out in order to develop a learner model based on learning theories since learning theories do spell out on how learning occurs and therefore useful in determining which learner characteristic to model. Systematic literature review on articles dealing with adaptive e-learning was carried out. Articles were extracted from various databases and were selected using a three step process. 16 articles were selected for the final analysis. The results of the analysis indicate that, there is evidence of basing adaptive e-learning systems on learning theories and the most utilized theory is cognitivism. The learner characteristic that is majorly modelled is learning style. In order to capture different learner characteristics we propose a learner model based on the three major learning theories; constructivism, cognitivism and behaviriousim.},

  abstract={In automatic speech recognition, performance gains can often be obtained by combining an ensemble of multiple models. However, this can be computationally expensive when performing recognition. Teacher-student learning alleviates this cost by training a single student model to emulate the combined ensemble behaviour. Only this student needs to be used for recognition. Previously investigated teacher-student criteria often limit the forms of diversity allowed in the ensemble, and only propagate information from the teachers to the student at the frame level. This paper addresses both of these issues by examining teacher-student learning within a sequence-level framework, and assessing the flexibility that these approaches offer. Various sequence-level teacher-student criteria are examined in this work, to propagate sequence posterior information. A training criterion based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence between context-dependent state sequence posteriors is proposed that allows for a diversity of state cluster sets to be present in the ensemble. This criterion is shown to be an upper bound to a more general KL-divergence between word sequence posteriors, which places even fewer restrictions on the ensemble diversity, but whose gradient can be expensive to compute. These methods are evaluated on the augmented multi-party interaction (AMI) meeting transcription and MGB-3 television broadcast audio tasks.},

  pages={107744-107756},
  abstract={Customer services are critical to all companies, as they may directly connect to the brand reputation. Due to a great number of customers, e-commerce companies often employ multiple communication channels to answer customers' questions, for example, Chatbot and Hotline. On one hand, each channel has limited capacity to respond to customers' requests; on the other hand, customers have different preferences over these channels. The current production systems are mainly built based on business rules that merely consider the tradeoffs between the resources and customers' satisfaction. To achieve the optimal tradeoff between the resources and customers' satisfaction, we propose a new framework based on deep reinforcement learning that directly takes both resources and user model into account. In addition to the framework, we also propose a new deep-reinforcement-learning-based routing method-double dueling deep Q-learning with prioritized experience replay (PER-DoDDQN). We evaluate our proposed framework and method using both synthetic and a real customer service log data from a large financial technology company. We show that our proposed deep-reinforcement-learning-based framework is superior to the existing production system. Moreover, we also show that our proposed PER-DoDDQN is better than all other deep Q-learning variants in practice, which provides a more optimal routing plan. These observations suggest that our proposed method can seek the tradeoff, where both channel resources and customers' satisfaction are optimal.},

  abstract={As 5G high-speed mobile communications developing rapidly, services and contents that people get from the Internet have been enriched significantly, which necessitates the user equipment (UE) to have least power consumption, reduced latency, enhanced lifetime and better QoS. However, the tail energy of LTE interface on UE leads to low energy efficiency which is caused by applying fixed Radio Resource Control (RRC) inactivity timer. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to eliminate the tail whenever possible and improve the user equipment power efficiency. We design a self-adaptive tool to optimize the LTE RRC inactivity timer for individual users based on user model. Firstly, The tool collects runtime network information from cellular networks and uses machine learning method to predict the session length. Then it adjusts inactivity timer dynamically based on the predicted session length. In addition, we propose an enhanced RRC protocol to support our proposed tool. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our energy-saving tool, we applied it on commercial off-the-shelf phones. Simulation results show the proposed tool can reduce the energy consumption of smart-phone by 27-33.5%.},

This work presents a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation framework to learn a lightweight pedestrian detector, which significantly reduces the computational cost and still holds the high accuracy at the same time. Following the `teacher-student' diagram that a stronger, deeper neural network can teach a lightweight network to learn better representations, we explore multiple knowledge distillation architectures and reframe this approach as a unified, hierarchical distillation framework. In particular, the proposed distillation is performed at multiple hierarchies, multiple stages in a modern detector, which empowers the student detector to learn both low-level details and high-level abstractions simultaneously. Experiment result shows that a student model trained by our framework, with 6 times compression in number of parameters, still achieves competitive performance as the teacher model on the widely used pedestrian detection benchmark.},

  abstract={This work aims to present a proposal that combines semantic web and metaheuristic strategies to recommend web-based Learning Objects (LO) according to learners' preferences. The idea is to create a content recommendation process that uses existing resources from the Web to recommend LO in virtual learning environments. In this approach, knowledge level and Learning Styles are considered in the student model. Preliminary results have shown the possibility of creation and personalized recommendation using Wikipedia contents. At the end, some questions according to the recommendation process and the web content should be answered.},

  abstract={Effective Student Models, capable of identifying and predicting the level of knowledge of students, are a key requirement in modern educational systems. In addition, it is important that the students themselves realize their level of knowledge at a given time, so they can self-regulate their learning process. Thus, this paper describes OSM-V, an Open Student Model with Information Visualization capabilities which allow students and instructors to assess information inferred in educational systems. To evaluate the perception of utility and behavioral changes in students who used the model, this paper also brings experiments regarding its integration to a real educational platform. Results showed that this proposal can positively impact students' learning and positively influence their behavior.},

  title={Speech Enhancement Based on Teacher–Student Deep Learning Using Improved Speech Presence Probability for Noise-Robust Speech Recognition}, 
  year={2019},
  volume={27},
  number={12},
  pages={2080-2091},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student learning framework for the preprocessing of a speech recognizer, leveraging the online noise tracking capabilities of improved minima controlled recursive averaging (IMCRA) and deep learning of nonlinear interactions between speech and noise. First, a teacher model with deep architectures is built to learn the target of ideal ratio masks (IRMs) using simulated training pairs of clean and noisy speech data. Next, a student model is trained to learn an improved speech presence probability by incorporating the estimated IRMs from the teacher model into the IMCRA approach. The student model can be compactly designed in a causal processing mode having no latency with the guidance of a complex and noncausal teacher model. Moreover, the clean speech requirement, which is difficult to meet in real-world adverse environments, can be relaxed for training the student model, implying that noisy speech data can be directly used to adapt the regression-based enhancement model to further improve speech recognition accuracies for noisy speech collected in such conditions. Experiments on the CHiME-4 challenge task show that our best student model with bidirectional gated recurrent units (BGRUs) can achieve a relative word error rate (WER) reduction of 18.85% for the real test set when compared to unprocessed system without acoustic model retraining. However, the traditional teacher model degrades the performance of the unprocessed system in this case. In addition, the student model with a deep neural network (DNN) in causal mode having no latency yields a relative WER reduction of 7.94% over the unprocessed system with 670 times less computing cycles when compared to the BGRU-equipped student model. Finally, the conventional speech enhancement and IRM-based deep learning method destroyed the ASR performance when the recognition system became more powerful. While our proposed approach could still improve the ASR performance even in the more powerful recognition system.},

  abstract={Additive manufacturing (AM) assisted by a digital twin is expected to revolutionize the realization of high-value and high-complexity functional parts on a global scale. Machine learning (ML) introduced in digitized AM provides potential to transform AM data into knowledge continuously and automatically; hence AM products will be designed and manufactured with improved quality. Conventional product development systems, however, fail to fully adopt ML algorithms on the increasingly available AM data for knowledge acquisition. To address the limitation, this paper proposes an algorithmic framework for constructing AM knowledge automatically and continuously from data. The proposed algorithm develops predictive models to correlate process parameters with part structure and properties using ML algorithms on design, process control, in-situ monitoring, and ex-situ measurement AM data. Based on the predictive models, the algorithm constructs prescriptive rules necessary for decision-making in AM product developments. The constructed rule knowledge is stored in a knowledge base by the algorithm for further AM knowledge query and constructions. Then, the algorithm provides feedback to a knowledge-query formulation phase, which forms the algorithm into a closed loop. Through the algorithm, AM knowledge can self-evolve continuously, while reflecting dynamically generated AM data in an automated and autonomous manner. A case study is presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm and a software prototype is developed to demonstrate the algorithm capability.},

  abstract={Digital Twins are core enablers of smart and autonomous manufacturing systems. Although they strive to represent their physical counterpart as accurately as possible, slight model or data errors will remain. We present an algorithm to compensate for those residual errors through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and data fed back from the manufacturing system. When learning, the Digital Twin acts as teacher and safety policy to ensure minimal performance. We test the algorithm in a sheet metal assembly context, in which locators of the fixture are optimally adjusted for individual assemblies.

  abstract={Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have shown rapid development in recent years, allowing learners to access high-quality digital material. Because of facilitated learning and the flexibility of the teaching environment, the number of participants is rapidly growing. However, extensive research reports that the high attrition rate and low completion rate are major concerns. In this paper, the early identification of students who are at risk of withdrew and failure is provided. Therefore, two models are constructed namely at-risk student model and learning achievement model. The models have the potential to detect the students who are in danger of failing and withdrawal at the early stage of the online course. The result reveals that all classifiers gain good accuracy across both models, the highest performance yield by GBM with the value of 0.894, 0.952 for first, second model respectively, while RF yield the value of 0.866, in at-risk student framework achieved the lowest accuracy. The proposed frameworks can be used to assist instructors in delivering intensive intervention support to at-risk students.},

  pages={5024-5029},
  abstract={Synthetic data generation has recently emerged as a substitution technique for handling the problem of bulk data needed in training machine learning algorithms. Healthcare, primarily cardiovascular domain is a major area where synthetic physiological data like Photoplethysmogram (PPG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Phonocardiogram (PCG), etc. are being used to improve accuracy of machine learning algorithm. Conventional synthetic data generation approach using mathematical formulations lack interpretability. Hence, aim of this paper is to generate synthetic PPG signal from a Digital twin platform replicating cardiovascular system. Such system can serve the dual purpose of replicating the physical system, so as to simulate specific `what if' scenarios as well as to generate large scale synthetic data with patho-physiological interpretability. Cardio-vascular Digital twin is modeled with a two chambered heart, haemodynamic equations and a baroreflex based pressure control mechanism to generate blood pressure and flow variations. Synthetic PPG signal is generated from the model for healthy and Atherosclerosis condition. Initial validation of the platform has been made on the basis of efficiency of the platform in clustering Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and non CAD PPG data by extracting features from the synthetically generated PPG and comparing that with PPG obtained from Physionet data.},

  pages={156752-156763},
  abstract={Person re-identification (Re-ID), which is for matching pedestrians across disjoint camera views in surveillance, has made great progress in supervised learning. However, requirement of a large number of labelled identities leads to high cost for large-scale Re-ID systems. Consequently, it is significant to study learning Re-ID with unlabelled data and limited labelled data, that is, semi-supervised person re-identification. When labelled data is limited, the learned model tends to overfit the data and cannot generalize well. Moreover, the scene variations between cameras lead to domain shift in the feature space, which makes mining auxiliary supervision information from unlabelled data more difficult. To address these problems, we propose a Distilled Camera-Aware Self Training framework for semi-supervised person re-identification. To alleviate the overfitting problem for learning from limited labelled data, we propose a Multi-Teacher Selective Similarity Distillation Loss to selectively aggregate the knowledge of multiple weak teacher models trained with different subsets and distill a stronger student model. Then, we exploit the unlabelled data by learning pseudo labels by clustering based on the student model for self training. To alleviate the effect of scene variations between cameras, we propose a Camera-Aware Hierarchical Clustering (CAHC) algorithm to perform intra-camera clustering and cross-camera clustering hierarchically. Experiments show that our method outperformed the state-of-the-art semi-supervised person re-identification methods.},

  abstract={Benefits of the peer assessment for both teachers and students are well documented in the literature. From the instructor perspective, it can scale grading in large classes, track students' progress, reduce the grading burden and provide an estimation of the final course grade. The existing peer assessment platforms generally offer limited support for the teacher; many of them are based on a predefined peer assessment scenario and the instructor does not have the opportunity to conFigure the workflow, review allocation or grade computing mechanisms. In this context, we propose a peer assessment system, called LearnEval, which provides comprehensive instructor support: creation and editing of assignments, detailed monitoring of student activity, including various scores and statistics, learner model visualization; in addition, the teacher can conFigure the scenario and scores in order to fit the needs of the course. The paper describes the LearnEval instructor module in terms of functionalities, implementation, as well as a pilot study in the context of a Multimedia Technologies in E-Learning project.},

  abstract={Advanced manufacturing that is adaptable to constantly changing product designs often requires dynamic changes on the factory floor to enable manufacture. The integration of robotic manufacture with machine learning approaches offers the possibility to enable such dynamic changes on the factory floor. While ensuring safety and the possibility of losses of components and waste of material are against their usage. Furthermore, developments in design of virtual environments makes it possible to perform simulations in a virtual environment, to enable human-in-the-loop production of parts correctly the first time like never before. Such powerful simulation and control software provides the means to design a digital twin of manufacturing environment in which trials are completed at almost at no cost. In this paper, ant colony optimization is used to program an industrial robot to avoid obstacles and find its way to pick and place objects during an assembly task in an environment containing obstacles that must be avoided. The optimization is completed in a digital twin environment first and movements transferred to the real robot after human inspection. It is shown that the proposed methodology can find the optimal solution, in addition to avoiding collisions, for an assembly task with minimum human intervention.},

  pages={1125-1139},
  abstract={To make efficient use of limited spectral resources, we in this work propose a deep actor-critic reinforcement learning based framework for dynamic multichannel access. We consider both a single-user case and a scenario in which multiple users attempt to access channels simultaneously. We employ the proposed framework as a single agent in the single-user case, and extend it to a decentralized multi-agent framework in the multi-user scenario. In both cases, we develop algorithms for the actor-critic deep reinforcement learning and evaluate the proposed learning policies via experiments and numerical results. In the single-user model, in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed channel access policy and the framework's tolerance against uncertainty, we explore different channel switching patterns and different switching probabilities. In the case of multiple users, we analyze the probabilities of each user accessing channels with favorable channel conditions and the probability of collision. We also address a time-varying environment to identify the adaptive ability of the proposed framework. Additionally, we provide comparisons (in terms of both the average reward and time efficiency) between the proposed actor-critic deep reinforcement learning framework, Deep-Q network (DQN) based approach, random access, and the optimal policy when the channel dynamics are known.},

  abstract={When, in 1956, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was officially declared a research field, no one would have ever predicted the huge influence and impact its description, prediction, and prescription capabilities were going to have on our daily lives. In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed. The design implications derived from the study are then presented: they focus on socio-technical design aspects and DT lifecycle. Open issues and challenges that require to be addressed in the future are finally discussed.},

  abstract={Achieving multiplication table fluency is a major concern during all primary school years and for many pupils it is considered a challenge. `Rote memory' approaches that have been deployed for years in the traditional school curriculum have contributed to the prevailing assumption of pupils that Mathematics is unpleasant and uninviting. This paper presents a game-based approach to assess and gradually improve multiplication skills by combining an adaptive mechanism for identifying and resolving pupil weaknesses, while exposing parts of the learner model to the user through easily perceivable visualizations. Moreover, the game offers social comparison information and pupils can access progress data about their peers or their entire class a feature that is expected to improve self-reflection, allow for self-regulated learning and increase user motivation. This paper also presents the feedback received by the preliminary testing of the game with a representative sample of pupils and discusses the effect of allowing access to the progress of peers and summative class scores.},

  abstract={One of the key issues of multi-sensory digital healthcare and therapy is the reliability and user compliance of the applied sensor system. In the context of digital gait analysis and rehabilitation, different technologies have been proposed allowing objective gait assessment and precise quantification of the rehabilitation progress using Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) platforms. However, this depends largely on the estimation accuracy of the kinematics (body joint angles). This paper presents the concept of a digital equivalent based on the Memory Polynomial Model (MPM) to reduce the number of IMUs needed for the measurements and to simulate the physical mechanism of lower body joint angles based on acceleration data. The MPM parameter estimation is based on the Least Square (LS) approach and is performed using accelerometer records of non-pathological gait patterns. The Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) is used to evaluate the performance of the model. According to the results an NMSE of -20 dB is achieved, which indicates the great potential of applying the MPM to develop a digital twin. That kind of twin can serve as a prototype of the physical counterpart to improve the wearability of the sensor system and to reduce physically induced measurement errors as well.},
