  year={2023},
  volume={72},
  number={},
  pages={1-13},
  abstract={At present, the method based on deep learning performs well in public object detection tasks. However, there are still two problems to be solved for industrial defect detection: 1) industrial scenes require real-time and lightweight and 2) lightweight network (LightNet) accuracy is limited. In order to tackle these issues, based on knowledge distillation (KL), this article proposes an effective lightweight defect detection network (KD-LightNet) suitable for edge scenes. First of all, a LightNet is designed based on structure reparameterization, which can sufficiently improve the capability of network feature extraction and reduce the complexity of model inferring. Moreover, a well-prepared self-distillation strategy is proposed, which utilizes the pretrained LightNet network as a teacher model to transfer knowledge in the same structure. Then, in order to fully utilize the logits predicted by the teacher model, an improved KL divergence loss is proposed to enhance the accuracy of the student model. Finally, in the experiments, three industrial datasets (PKU-Market-PCB, NEU-DET, and Magnetic tile defect dataset) were used to validate the proposed model performance. The KD-LightNet detection accuracy (mAP) is improved by an average of 6.87%, while the average detection speed reaches 72 frames/s at 3070Ti (Params 4.7 M), which meets the requirements of industrial defect detection accuracy and real-time.},

  title={Building a Smart Campus Digital Twin: System, Analytics and Lessons Learned From a Real-World Project}, 
  year={2023},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Smart solutions increasingly involve the use of sensor data to represent the physical world in the digital world and apply intelligence to such representation. The main approach is a vertical end-to-end solution from sensors to intelligence and back to actuators. Recently, a new holistic approach, the so-called Digital Twin, has emerged. This goes beyond traditional smart solutions by replicating, with high fidelity cross-domain aspects, a physical object into the digital world. The key differentiation is the inclusion of semantics information in the digital replica in a form of knowledge graph. Further, analytics continuously enrich Digital Twin’s information with predictions and insights. In this article, we adopt the Digital Twin approach for the creation of a digital replica of Espinardo’s campus at the University of Murcia (Spain). The starting point is the existing sensor network deployment and the infrastructure under development of Fog-Edge-Cloud computing based on a 5G private network. The smart campus Digital Twin is formed by the Digital Twins of 23 buildings for which different sets of data features have been thoroughly selected. We implement the concept of Digital Twin by merging sensor data with external open data sources, analytics models implemented and information processed by these analytics. We report our experience showing the issues encountered handling the data and producing various analytics models for predicting energy consumption, building occupancy, room usage, solar energy, and anomaly detection. From our experience, we highlight some lessons learned and directions towards the full operational smart campus Digital Twin.},

  title={Structured Knowledge Distillation for Accurate and Efficient Object Detection}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={45},
  number={12},
  pages={15706-15724},
  abstract={Knowledge distillation, which aims to transfer the knowledge learned by a cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight student model, has become one of the most popular and effective techniques in computer vision. However, many previous knowledge distillation methods are designed for image classification and fail in more challenging tasks such as object detection. In this paper, we first suggest that the failure of knowledge distillation on object detection is mainly caused by two reasons: (1) the imbalance between pixels of foreground and background and (2) lack of knowledge distillation on the relation among different pixels. Then, we propose a structured knowledge distillation scheme, including attention-guided distillation and non-local distillation to address the two issues, respectively. Attention-guided distillation is proposed to find the crucial pixels of foreground objects with an attention mechanism and then make the students take more effort to learn their features. Non-local distillation is proposed to enable students to learn not only the feature of an individual pixel but also the relation between different pixels captured by non-local modules. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method on thirteen kinds of object detection models with twelve comparison methods for both object detection and instance segmentation. For instance, Faster RCNN with our distillation achieves 43.9 mAP on MS COCO2017, which is 4.1 higher than the baseline. Additionally, we show that our method is also beneficial to the robustness and domain generalization ability of detectors. Codes and model weights have been released on GitHub1.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={236-241},
  abstract={This paper considers a use case of flying base station placement enabled by digital twin (DT), and demonstrates how DT can help reduce the impact of a non-stationary environment on reinforcement learning (RL). RL is able to learn the optimal policy via interacting with a specific environment. However, it has been observed that RL is very sensitive to environment change, mainly because the environment variation disturbs RL training/learning. A possible approach is to execute the RL process in the DT using snapshots of the environment (parameters), and update the parameters at a proper frequency. The DT-RL bundled approach takes advantage of computing resources in the DT, speeds up the process and saves battery energy of the flying base station, and more importantly, mitigates the nonstationary impact on RL. Specifically, the use case is about quickly connecting mobile users with an aerial bass station. The base station is autonomously and optimally placed according to a predefined criterion to connect scattered slow-movement users. Q-learning, a common type of RL, is employed as a solution to the optimization of base station placement. Tailored for this application, a two-stage base station placement algorithm is proposed and evaluated. For the configuration considered in this paper, numerical results suggest that 1) the Q-learning algorithm run solely in the physical space does not work due to intolerable time consuming and optimization divergence, and 2) the proposed scheme can catch up with random slow movement of mobile users, and tolerate certain measurement and model errors. With necessary modification and extension, the proposed framework could be applied to other DT-assisted cyber-physical systems.},

  abstract={Comparatively to other fields, the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based medical decisions remains limited. In general, AI-based medical decisions necessitate modeling the conditions being treated, including potential treatment alternatives and trajectories. Due to the heterogeneity of most medical conditions, developing these models requires a vast quantity of data. Although current healthcare systems generate abundant digital data, this data is frequently fragmented, stored in multiple locations, organized according to various structures, and lacks context, posing a challenge for integrating and utilizing these data to model the relevant conditions. Effective AI medical solutions, we argue, necessitate the development of an AI-specific medical vocabulary, which we call information tokens. The proposed vocabulary would enable AI methods to access diverse medical records and provide the context for developing treatment models, instead of only conditions-specific models. Then, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based agent, the human digital twin, which models medical conditions and provides patient-specific treatment recommendations based on the condition vocabulary. Finally, we define a framework for managing and coordinating the utilization and update of the vocabulary, and the treatment models throughout a healthcare system.},

  pages={171-172},
  abstract={AI-based digital twins are at the leading edge of the Industry 4.0 revolution, which are technologically empowered by the Internet of Things and real-time data analysis. Information collected from industrial assets is produced in a continuous fashion, yielding data streams that must be processed under stringent timing constraints. Such data streams are usually subject to non-stationary phenomena, causing that the data distribution of the streams may change, and thus the knowledge captured by models used for data analysis may become obsolete (leading to the so-called concept drift effect). The early detection of the change (drift) is crucial for updating the model’s knowledge, which is challenging especially in scenarios where the ground truth associated to the stream data is not readily available. Among many other techniques, the estimation of the model’s confidence has been timidly suggested in a few studies as a criterion for detecting drifts in unsupervised settings. The goal of this manuscript is to confirm and expose solidly the connection between the model’s confidence in its output and the presence of a concept drift, showcasing it experimentally and advocating for a major consideration of uncertainty estimation in comparative studies to be reported in the future.},

  abstract={In this study, we propose a novel sensor and data-driven marketability model to accompany the digital twin of a strawberry based on the environmental conditions encountered throughout the storage and transportation of commercial perishable goods. Postharvest, the quality of strawberries deteriorates and an accurate representation of the marketability of the digital twin becomes crucial. However, a true data driven model is difficult to build due to lack of sufficient data which can be collected during transportation. With the help of trained food and postharvest scientists, marketability data was collected on a large volume of strawberries exposed to different temperature treatments in environmental chambers. Later, machine learning was used to learn the correlation between the marketability of strawberries and the typical temperatures they are exposed to during transportation. We demonstrated that the proposed data-driven algorithm can achieve a similar marketability assessment as the trained experts in the field with an error percentage as low 4.21% using support vector regression which can enable smart distribution such as First-Expired-First-Out.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation aims to enhance the performance of a lightweight student model by exploiting the knowledge from a pre-trained cumbersome teacher model. However, in the traditional knowledge distillation, teacher predictions are only used to provide the supervisory signal for the last layer of the student model, which may result in those shallow student layers lacking accurate training guidance in the layer-by-layer back propagation and thus hinders effective knowledge transfer. To address this issue, we propose Deeply-Supervised Knowledge Distillation (DSKD), which fully utilizes class predictions and feature maps of the teacher model to supervise the training of shallow student layers. A loss-based weight allocation strategy is developed in DSKD to adaptively balance the learning process of each shallow layer, so as to further improve the student performance. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet with various teacher-student models show significantly performance, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed method.

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is gradually becoming more prevalent through numerous devices and technologies, including sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, cloud-enabled services, and analytics. IoT objects gain intelligence by integrating with wireless sensor networks (WSNs), mobile computing and communication, and others. With sensors, smart things can be enabled by monitoring and identifying environmental changes related to motion, temperature, humidity, pressure, light, vibration, etc. To timely keep track of state changes, researchers are considering developing a cyber replicator, denoted as Digital Twin (DT), of real physical systems as a way to visualize, model, and work with complex cyber-physical systems (CPS). In this paper, we first refine the dataset to a format that can be easily used for deep learning (DL) experiments, IoT data pipeline development, data modeling and simulation, data aggregation, etc. We then demonstrate that DT data can be used to determine space occupancy based on the ambient light sensor, which tends to indicate occupancy in particular spaces because the building has smart lighting that will switch off when rooms are unoccupied after a certain time. Given the apparent developments in machine learning technology, it is clear that machine learning-based prediction has the ability to enhance resource utilization and further forecast future events. Particularly, we use a DT-based dataset and Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture to forecast the campus building’s internal temperature.},

  abstract={The Advanced and radical development of IT technology and artificial intelligence technology have made it possible to develop advanced services Digital Twin, Metaverse, Metatwin-verse, etc using Artificial Intelligence(AI). The results induced from AI present the correct solution when AI performs accurate study and analysis. Specifically, real situations reflecting complex relationships between objects, results from real situations have to be adaptive to convergence situations and then it should be possible to draw conclusions and make decisions that are not limited to specific situations. So, it is essential to conduct AI based study and analysis by considering these real world characteristics to provide digital twin services based on metaverse. Recently, there are many studies on Graph Neural Network(GNN) and services applied to GNN for learning the relationship between objects detected in real situations. Accordingly, this paper proposes a metaverse-based Digital Twin Convergence Service(DTCS) including spatial elements strategy that is possible to draw accurate conclusions in a changing convergence situation. DTCS is able to conduct causal reasoning and association learning between objects considering directions and distances change characteristics between objects and this is possible to make correct solution and decision making in the process of simulation and analysis of digital twin. In that DTCS proceeds by considering distance and changing angle between objects, this overcomes the limitation of existing GNN which only considers the degree of association or assigns the same parameters to connected objects. DTCS would be possible to expand the advanced services of Metatwinverse in that it is possible to have robust learning based conclusions in real-time changing convergence situations.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect novel objects with limited annotated examples. Mainstream methods suffer from the data scarcity of novel classes with insufficient intra-class variations, which makes the trained model biased to base classes. Actually, there are massive unlabeled novel instances in the base dataset and their adequate utilization will enhance the discriminability of model to novel classes. This paper proposes a semi-supervised few-shot object detection method, which utilizes a teacher model and a pre-trained few-shot object detector to guide the learning of a student model through adaptive pseudo labeling. In particular, a class-adaptive threshold filtering (CATF) strategy is designed to deal with the class-imbalance problem of pseudo labels. And for each novel class, the threshold to select valuable pseudo labels is determined by quantile statistics of the confidence score distribution of pseudo labels. Furthermore, the pre-trained detector and the teacher model are associated with the preliminary CATF and in-depth CATF, respectively, and then the pseudo labels from the two-stream CATF are fused to provide supervisions. In this way, the knowledge of these two models is exploited, which improves the quality of pseudo labels. Under these supervisions, the student model is trained and the teacher model is correspondingly updated through parameters sharing, thus forming a positive feedback to improve the performance of both models. Besides, an attention module is integrated to the teacher and student models to enhance the feature representation of novel instances. The validations on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  pages={1247-1251},
  abstract={In recent years, multi-view clustering has gained widespread attention in signal processing because multi-view data contains more information than a single view. However, multi-view data is often incomplete due to missing data in one or more random views. Therefore, several methods have been proposed for incomplete multi-view clustering to learn features that contain consensus information for clustering incomplete multi-view data (IMD). However, there is a part of the IMD that is not missing in any view, and most previous methods have not utilized this part to guide the process of learning consensus information. To address this issue, we design a knowledge distillation framework for incomplete multi-view clustering and propose an incomplete multi-view clustering with complete view guidance (IMC-CVG). We first train a robust teacher model with contrastive learning loss on the complete part of IMD to learn consensus features containing multi-view information. Then, we train a student model on all the IMD, where we mask partial views of the complete data to simulate missing data, and utilize the teacher model to guide the student model to learn consensus features that contain as much multi-view information as possible. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms all the compared state-of-the-art methods.},

The erector unit is a human-controlled robot with six degrees of freedom movement used to grab and place the individual tunnel segments. The experience of the erector operator is hence decisive for an efficient ring building process, which can be optimized with the assistance of intelligent control systems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a learning approach that provided many control policies for robotic applications. Currently, no simulation environment is publicly available to train and test RL agents on erector units in tunnel ring building. This research aims to address this gap by designing an Experimental Digital Twin (EDT) for the erector unit in ring building. We created our EDT using the simulation tool MuJoCo and Proximal Policy Optimization as RL method. Our findings reveal that the RL agent learned to successfully build tunnel rings with a control policy that can be further optimized for fine adjustments in segment placing, especially the last ring segment. Our future work consists of investigating the RL agent robustness and studying transfer potential to real-world applications under safety constraints. Our EDT is a first step towards learning control policies that optimally execute segment lining, thus helping human operators build tunnel rings efficiently in a challenging work environment prone to accidents and decreasing interest from future talents.},

  abstract={Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging analysis has been a useful tool in screening patients for heart disease. Early, timely and accurate diagnosis of diseases of the heart series is the key to effective treatment. MRI provides important material for the diagnosis of cardiac diseases. The rise of deep learning has transformed computer-aided diagnostic systems, especially in the field of medical imaging. Existing work on cardiac structure segmentation models based on MRI imaging mainly relies on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which lack model diversity and limit the prediction performance. This paper introduces Visual Transformer with Feature Recombination and Feature Distillation(ViT-FRD), a novel learning pipeline that combines a visual transformer (ViT) and a CNN through knowledge refinement. The training procedure allows the student model, i.e., ViT, to learn from the teacher model, i.e., CNN, by optimizing distillation losses. Meanwhile, ViT-FRD provides two performance boosters to increase the efficacy and efficiency of training. The proposed method is validated on two cardiac MRI image datasets. The findings demonstrate that ViT-FRD achieves SOTA and outperforms the widely used baseline model.},

Both statistical analysis-based and machine learning (ML)-based approaches have been employed to tackle this task with varying degrees of success.

  abstract={Smart healthcare aims to revolutionize med-ical services by integrating artificial intelligence (AI). The limitations of classical machine learning include privacy concerns that prevent direct data sharing among medical institutions, untimely updates, and long training times. To address these issues, this study proposes a digital twin-assisted quantum federated learning algorithm (DTQFL). By leveraging the 5G mobile network, digital twins (DT) of patients can be created instantly using data from various Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices and simultane-ously reduce communication time in federated learning (FL) at the same time. DTQFL generates DT for patients with specific diseases, allowing for synchronous training and updating of the variational quantum neural network (VQNN) without disrupting the VQNN in the real world. This study utilized DTQFL to train its own personalized VQNN for each hospital, considering privacy security and training speed. Simultaneously, the personalized VQNN of each hospital was obtained through further local iterations of the final global parameters. The results indicate that DTQFL can train a good VQNN without collecting local data while achieving accuracy comparable to that of data-centralized algorithms. In addition, after personalized train-ing, the VQNN can achieve higher accuracy than that with-out personalized training.},

A virtual model for selecting the optimal machine line was developed to ensure cost-efficient printing. The machine line selection process was modeled as a decision process and then analyzed through simulations in a safe and cost-efficient digital environment, provided by the DT.

  abstract={As the digital replica of a physical system (PS), a digital twin (DT) is responsible for providing real-time information of its PS to applications. However, random network conditions result in uncertainty in future age of information (AoI) at the DT, which makes it complicated for a DT to decide when to response an application request in order to maintain the best information freshness at the application. In this work, we consider the effect of random wireless channel condition between the PS and the DT on the AoI changes at the DT, and formulate a Markov decision process that finds the optimum response time for the DT to send the PS information to an application after receiving a request from the application. The objective is to minimize the average AoI at the application. The MDP has delayed reward, and is solved by redistributing the reward with LSTM network and then finding the optimal policies using Dueling Double Deep Q-learning. Numerical results show that the solutions provide close-to-optimum average AoI performance.},

  abstract={In a photovoltaic power plant (PVPP), the DC-AC converter (inverter) is one of the components most prone to faults. Even though they are key equipment in such installations, their fault detection techniques are not as much explored as PV module-related issues, for instance. In that sense, this paper is motivated to find novel tools for detection focused on the inverter, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms trained using a hybrid dataset. The hybrid dataset is composed of real and synthetic data for fault-free and faulty conditions. A dataset is built based on fault-free data from the PVPP and faulty data generated by a digital twin (DT). The combination DT and ML is employed using a Clarke/space vector representation of the inverter electrical variables, thus resulting in a novel feature engineering method to extract the most relevant features that can properly represent the operating condition of the PVPP. The solution that was developed can classify multiple operation conditions of the inverter with high accuracy.},

  year={2023},
  volume={61},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={Numerical modeling of ground penetrating radars (GPRs), such as the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, has been extensively used to enhance the interpretation of GPR data and as a key component of full-waveform inversion (FWI). A major drawback of numerical solvers, especially within the context of FWI, is that they are still computationally expensive requiring often unattainable computational resources and access to high-performance computing (HPC). In this work, we present a near real-time deep-learning forward solver for GPR data that can generate entire B-scans, given certain model parameters as inputs. The machine-learning (ML) model is tuned for reinforced concrete slab scenarios, but the same rationale can be applied in a straightforward manner to other applications as well. The training was performed using entirely synthetic data, where a 3-D digital twin based on the 2000-MHz “palm” antenna from Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc. (GSSI) was included in FDTD simulations for the training set. The accuracy of the deep-learning solver is demonstrated with both synthetic and real data from reinforced concrete slabs. The predicted ML responses were in very good agreement with FDTD, showing a high degree of accuracy. The ML solver is then used as part of an FWI algorithm to characterize the concrete slab and estimate the depth and radius of the buried rebars. Coupled FWI with an ML-based forward solver results in significantly less execution times compared to conventional FWI using numerical solvers. The high accuracy of the proposed FWI, combined with the efficiency and speed of the ML-based forward solver, make the proposed scheme an ideal tool for characterizing concrete structures in nondestructive testing.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={60-63},
  abstract={When training convolutional neural networks, noise distribution in data can affect segmentation accuracy. Therefore, many neural networks will strengthen the segmentation ability of the model by artificially adding noise. However, because the noise distribution of the input data is not known, the model training process can only generate random noise, e.g., gaussian noise, but cannot simulate real-world noise. In the medical imaging domain, more attention is paid to the image contours, which can also be used for noising simulation. Meanwhile, considering the existence of rich unlabeled data sets in medical images, this paper proposes a semi-supervised framework for uncertainty estimation by using Monte Carlo Dropout and generates adaptive noise using the uncertainty map. Specifically, the framework consists of three parts, including a noise generation model, a teacher model, and a student model. The noise generation part processes the data input to the other two parts and uses the contour feature identified by the posteriori uncertainty map to simulate priori noise to guide the process of training segmentation model. Meanwhile, the student model updates its parameters based on the teacher model output and the ground truth annotations by minimizing a joint loss. Segmentation experiments on left atrium 3D data show that our method has competitive results with other SOTA semi-supervised methods.},

  abstract={Future smart cities are expected to provide intelligent services such as predictions, detections, and automation through digital twins. However, the creation of digital twins requires the processing of an enormous amount of data, thereby leading to an increase in mobile network traffic. This traffic is produced by applications in user devices and city services, which engage in local consumption at the city scale through sensor and camera devices using mobile networks. Such increased traffic can compromise the communication speed and stability. To alleviate this burden, traffic offloading becomes a crucial consideration in the beyond-5G era. This paper presents a scheme known as Area-Controlled Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking (AMoND). AMoND uses a hierarchical structure of a location layer and an ad-hoc layer to construct area-controlled mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) for mutual support of the digital twin and MANETs. AMoND effectively suppresses mobile network traffic by harnessing the digital twin to assist the MANETs during data collection for the digital twin construction. Importantly, the digital twin used in AMoND focuses on the management of node location information and does not need to reproduce the real space on a computer fully. AMoND is not dependent on a specific MANET protocol and can be used as an add-on. AMoND exhibits the ability to reduce traffic volumes by up to approximately 65%, while maintaining arrival rates that are comparable to existing MANET protocols under certain conditions.},

  abstract={With the emergence of digitalization technology, digital twin bridges the gap between physical and virtual worlds in industrial production with synchronization, reliability, and fidelity. The manufacturing process of complex products needs multiple working procedures, where novel industrial parts occur, causing scenes to be variable for robots to perceive and grasp. Due to the geometric difference among objects in various categories, it is significant to empower robotic systems with the capability of continuous learning for grasp detection in variable scenes. Therefore, a digital twin robotic system is proposed to realize bidirectional real-time data interaction and synchronization in the physical and virtual worlds. In this digital twin robotic system, a synthetic grasp detection dataset composed of industrial parts is built for an industrial grasping task. Besides, a novel deep learning method, adaptive spatial-awareness grasp network with a novel cc, is proposed to realize end-to-end 7-DoF grasp detection for industrial objects. In addition, a continuous learning strategy is proposed for 7-DoF grasp pose detection without catastrophic forgetting in variable scenes. Experiments in both virtual and physical worlds have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method for potential industrial implementation, and the average grasping success rate reaches 91% and 88% for novel objects in the virtual and physical worlds, respectively.},

  abstract={In recent years, online distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for adapting real-time deep neural networks on the fly using a slow, but accurate teacher model. However, a major challenge in online distillation is catastrophic forgetting when the domain shifts, which occurs when the student model is updated with data from the new domain and forgets previously learned knowledge. In this paper, we propose a solution to this issue by leveraging the power of continual learning methods to reduce the impact of domain shifts. Specifically, we integrate several state-of-the-art continual learning methods in the context of online distillation and demonstrate their effectiveness in reducing catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of our proposed solution in the case of cyclic domain shifts. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving the robustness and accuracy of online distillation, with potential applications in domains such as video surveillance or autonomous driving. Overall, our work represents an important step forward in the field of online distillation and continual learning, with the potential to significantly impact real-world applications.},

  pages={1971-1981},
  abstract={Although there are many methods based on deep learning that have superior performance on single image super-resolution (SISR), it is difficult to run in real time on devices with limited computing power. Some recent studies have found that simply relying on reducing parameters or reducing the theoretical FLOPs of the model does not speed up the inference time of the network in a practical sense. Actual speed on the device is probably a better measure than FLOPs. In this work, we propose a new single residual network (SRN). On the one hand, we try to introduce and optimize an attention mechanism module to improve the performance of the network with a relatively small speed loss. On the other hand, we find that residuals in residual blocks do not have a positive impact on networks with adjusted ESA. Therefore, the residual of the network residual block is removed, which not only improves the speed of the network, but also improves the performance of the network. Finally, we reduced the number of channels and the number of residual blocks of the classic model EDSR, and removed the last convolution before the long residual. We set this tuned EDSR as the teacher model and our newly proposed SRN as the student model. Under the joint effect of the original loss and the distillation loss, the performance of the network can be improved without losing the inference time. Combining the above strategies, our proposed model runs much faster than similarly performing models. As an example, we built a Fast and Efficient Network (SRN) and its small version SRN-S, which run 30%-37% faster than the state-of-the-art EISR model: a paper champion RLFN. Furthermore, the shallow version of SRN-S achieves the second-shortest inference time as well as the second-smallest number of activations in the NTIRE2023 challenge. Code will be available at https://github.com/wnxbwyc/SRN.},

  abstract={Along with the advent of COVID-19 epidemic, delivery services have become one of the most common services in our daily life. However, the current services merely assume that the contact for handing over delivery items is denied to avoid facing between carriers and receivers. This extreme concept might lead to the ruin of typical processes for delivery services, such as face-to-face authentication, item checking, and payment in person. So, it may cause insufficiency regarding both sides of the secure item delivery and customers’ personal security. Therefore, this paper comes up with a novel CONTACTFUL delivery service with the digital twin paradigm to resolve contactless problems. The proposed idea establishes two-tier digital twin architecture to arrange digital twins and physical twins of carriers and receivers. Then, inter-digital-twin interaction virtually supports on-site delivery service processes. The inter-twin interaction relies on highly accurate proximity detection for items, carriers, and receivers. So, the proposed scheme considers machine-learning technologies and filtering algorithms to achieve high precision based on mobile-based Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beaconing. This scheme is implemented as a proof-of-concept prototype, and various field data are exploited to build ML-filtering models including their ensemble one. On the steel door, the ensemble model shows an accuracy improvement of 65% compared to SVM, 14% to CNN, and 73% to MLP. On the wood door, the ensemble model shows an accuracy improvement of 21% compared to SVM, 9% to CNN, and 17% to MLP.},

  abstract={Recently, there has been increasing interest in the challenge of how to discriminatively vectorize graphs. To address this, we propose a method called Iterative Graph Self-Distillation (IGSD) which learns graph-level representation in an unsupervised manner through instance discrimination using a self-supervised contrastive learning approach. IGSD involves a teacher-student distillation process that uses graph diffusion augmentations and constructs the teacher model using an exponential moving average of the student model. The intuition behind IGSD is to predict the teacher network representation of the graph pairs under different augmented views. As a natural extension, we also apply IGSD to semi-supervised scenarios by jointly regularizing the network with both supervised and self-supervised contrastive loss. Finally, we show that finetuning the IGSD-trained models with self-training can further improve the graph representation power. Empirically, we achieve significant and consistent performance gain on various graph datasets in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, which well validates the superiority of IGSD.},

  abstract={Current knowledge distillation methods used in object detection often ignore the importance of global information in object detection and the quantity of foreground and background samples is unbalanced in the process of object detection training. Aiming at the above problems, a knowledge distillation method for object detection based on foreground enhancement and spatial frequency is proposed. This method uses the foreground enhancement module to introduce the attention mechanism to enhance the expression ability of the key region in the backbone feature, forcing the student model and the teacher model to focus on the same key region. The spatial frequency module guides the student model to inherit the global information contained in the teacher network by using the property of fast Fourier convolution. The losses of the neck network classifier and the regressor are calculated separately. Finally, all losses are fed into the full connection layer to obtain the final distillation loss. Experiments show that the proposed method can be applied to different object detection frameworks. Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and FCOS with ResNet-50 as the backbone network obtained mAP of 40.8%, 39.9%, and 42.9% on the COCO dataset, respectively, an increase of 2.4%, 2.5%, and 4.4% compared with the benchmark.},

  abstract={Digital twin has been emerging as a promising paradigm that connects physical entities and digital space, and continuously evolves to optimize the physical systems. In this paper, we focus on studying efficient communication and computation scheme when constructing the Marine Internet of Things (M-IoT)’s digital twin with secrecy provisioning. Specifically, the digital twin model is trained based on federated learning, in which all the unmanned surface vehicles deliver the trained models with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to the high altitude platform (HAP) for global model aggregation. Considering the potential eavesdropping on the radio signals of HAP, we utilize the chaotic sequences to spread the model information before the global model broadcasting. In this framework, we aim to minimize the total energy consumption for constructing the digital twin of M-IoT by jointly optimizing the global accuracy, the local accuracy, the HAP’s transmission power and NOMA transmission duration, subject to the secrecy provisioning and latency constraint. An effective low-complexity algorithm is proposed to tackle this joint optimization problem with the use of a layered feature. Finally, numerical results are given to validate the performance gain of the proposed scheme, in comparison with the fixed accuracy scheme, the non-spread spectrum scheme and the time division multiple access transmission scheme.},

  title={Adaptive Teaching for Cross-Domain Crowd Counting},

  abstract={The main challenge of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) crowd counting is the large domain gap between a synthetic domain with annotations (source) and a real-world domain of interest without annotations (target). Previous mainstream UDA crowd counting methods either employ feature alignment or a semi-supervised learning paradigm via pseudo-labels. We for the first time combine both of their advantages and propose an Adversarial Mean Teacher (AMT) framework. On the one hand, we optimize the student model with domain adversarial learning. On the other hand, we feed perturbed target images to the teacher model to generate pseudo-labels. Furthermore, to improve the quality of the pseudo-labels, we propose an Adaptive Teaching (AT) module, consisting of pseudo-label refinement and credible pseudo-label selection. Concretely, we first generate two candidate pseudo-labels from the prediction of the teacher model and obtain a refined pseudo-label by mixing them at the pixel-level. Moreover, we introduce an auxiliary task of foreground-background classification to assist credible region selection and only activate supervision signals on those regions. Extensive experiments on four real-world crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method namely Cross-Domain Adaptive Teacher (CDAT). The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Yankeegsj/CDAT.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation (KD) is a conventional method in the field of deep learning that enables the transfer of dark knowledge from a teacher model to a student model, consequently improving the performance of the student model. In randomized neural networks, due to the simple topology of network architecture and the insignificant relationship between model performance and model size, KD is not able to improve model performance. In this work, we propose a self-distillation pipeline for randomized neural networks: the predictions of the network itself are regarded as the additional target, which are mixed with the weighted original target as a distillation target containing dark knowledge to supervise the training of the model. All the predictions during multi-generation self-distillation process can be integrated by a multi-teacher method. By induction, we have additionally arrived at the methods for infinite self-distillation (ISD) of randomized neural networks. We then provide relevant theoretical analysis about the self-distillation method for randomized neural networks. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in practical applications on several benchmark datasets.},

  title={VulExplainer: A Transformer-Based Hierarchical Distillation for Explaining Vulnerability Types}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={49},
  number={10},
  pages={4550-4565},
  abstract={Deep learning-based vulnerability prediction approaches are proposed to help under-resourced security practitioners to detect vulnerable functions. However, security practitioners still do not know what type of vulnerabilities correspond to a given prediction (aka CWE-ID). Thus, a novel approach to explain the type of vulnerabilities for a given prediction is imperative. In this paper, we propose VulExplainer, an approach to explain the type of vulnerabilities. We represent VulExplainer as a vulnerability classification task. However, vulnerabilities have diverse characteristics (i.e., CWE-IDs) and the number of labeled samples in each CWE-ID is highly imbalanced (known as a highly imbalanced multi-class classification problem), which often lead to inaccurate predictions. Thus, we introduce a Transformer-based hierarchical distillation for software vulnerability classification in order to address the highly imbalanced types of software vulnerabilities. Specifically, we split a complex label distribution into sub-distributions based on CWE abstract types (i.e., categorizations that group similar CWE-IDs). Thus, similar CWE-IDs can be grouped and each group will have a more balanced label distribution. We learn TextCNN teachers on each of the simplified distributions respectively, however, they only perform well in their group. Thus, we build a transformer student model to generalize the performance of TextCNN teachers through our hierarchical knowledge distillation framework. Through an extensive evaluation using the real-world 8,636 vulnerabilities, our approach outperforms all of the baselines by 5%–29%. The results also demonstrate that our approach can be applied to Transformer-based architectures such as CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, and CodeGPT. Moreover, our method maintains compatibility with any Transformer-based model without requiring any architectural modifications but only adds a special distillation token to the input. These results highlight our significant contributions towards the fundamental and practical problem of explaining software vulnerability.},

  abstract={In this article, we investigate an effective energy management scheme in a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular Metaverse synchronization system. UAVs purchase energy resources from an energy service provider (ESP) and collect data for a virtual service provider (VSP) to perform synchronization between physical objects and digital twins (DTs). The key issue is to motivate both ESP and UAVs to participate in the energy trading market. To doing so, we design an incentive mechanism that maximizes the revenue of the ESP while guaranteeing desired economic properties, i.e. individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC). In particular, we first consider a single energy unit market, where a deep learning (DL)-based auction scheme is developed to construct neural networks from the analytical results of Myerson auction. The proposed DL-based auction is guaranteed to fulfill the optimal auction. We then consider a general scenario in which ESP has multiple energy units available to UAVs. A novel DL-based auction with feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) is proposed to jointly optimize the energy unit allocation and payment rules. We provide numerical results to demonstrate the performance improvement of the DL-based auction schemes compared to the classical auctions in terms of revenue, IC and IR. In particular, for the single energy unit market, the proposed DL-based auction scheme significantly improves the revenue compared with the classical auction and more interestingly, is able to avoid prevent UAVs from submitting their false values.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={The deployment of automated deep-learning classifiers in clinical practice has the potential to streamline the diagnosis process and improve the diagnosis accuracy, but the acceptance of those classifiers relies on both their accuracy and interpretability. In general, accurate deep-learning classifiers provide little model interpretability, while interpretable models do not have competitive classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a new deep-learning diagnosis framework, called InterNRL, that is designed to be highly accurate and interpretable. InterNRL consists of a student-teacher framework, where the student model is an interpretable prototype-based classifier (ProtoPNet) and the teacher is an accurate global image classifier (GlobalNet). The two classifiers are mutually optimised with a novel reciprocal learning paradigm in which the student ProtoPNet learns from optimal pseudo labels produced by the teacher GlobalNet, while GlobalNet learns from ProtoPNet’s classification performance and pseudo labels. This reciprocal learning paradigm enables InterNRL to be flexibly optimised under both fully- and semi-supervised learning scenarios, reaching state-of-the-art classification performance in both scenarios for the tasks of breast cancer and retinal disease diagnosis. Moreover, relying on weakly-labelled training images, InterNRL also achieves superior breast cancer localisation and brain tumour segmentation results than other competing methods.},

  year={2023},
  volume={23},
  number={21},
  pages={26765-26775},
  abstract={Myoelectric control is a typical modality of neural interfaces always driven by pattern recognition of surface electromyogram (sEMG). However, due to great cross-user variability, it suffers from severe performance degradation when it is trained on one set of user data and then tested with new user data. To improve its cross-user usability, a dual-step domain adaptation network (DSDAN) is proposed to fully exploit useful information in the training data (source domain) and efficiently deliver it to the testing data from a new user (target domain). The DSDAN is based on bidirectional knowledge distillation (KD) and uses a teacher–student model to implement the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which allows the classification model to adapt to a new user in the testing phase without any labeled data. A bidirectional KD technique was adopted to facilitate mutual learning between the teacher and student networks to address the problem of balancing adaptation speed and accuracy in the UDA. A novel dual-step domain adaptation (DSDA) strategy was utilized to mitigate knowledge obsolescence and error accumulation problems in KD. We evaluated the performance of the DSDAN framework on both high- and low-density sEMG datasets and achieved 98.96 ± 4.91% and 98.09 ± 1.86% recognition accuracies, respectively, which are better than those of mainstream UDA methods ( ${p}< {0.01}$ ). This study demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the DSDAN framework in a cross-user myoelectric control task, which could be applied in gestural interfaces and intelligent robotic control.},

  abstract={The vision of Industry 4.0 introduces new requirements to Operational Technology (OT) systems. Solutions for these requirements already exist in the realm of Information Technology (IT), however, due to the different characteristics of IT and OT, these solutions often cannot be directly used in the realm of OT. We therefore propose an Industrial Business Process Twin (IBPT), allowing to apply methods of one world to another not directly but, instead, to a representation, that is in bidirectional exchange with the other world. The proposed IBPT entity acts as an intermediary, decoupling the realms of IT and OT, thus allowing for an integration of IT and OT components of different manufacturers and platforms. Using this approach, we demonstrate the four essential Industry 4.0 design principles information transparency, technical assistance, interconnection and decentralized decisions based on the gamified Industry 4.0 scenario of playing the game of Nine Men’s Morris. This scenario serves well for agent based Artificial Intelligence (AI)-research and education. We develop an Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) information and communication model and then evaluate the IBPT component with respect to the different views of the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0).},

  abstract={This paper proposes a hybrid computational framework for fault detection during the coil winding manufacturing process by using a combination of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model with a Supervised Machine Learning (SML) algorithm. The conventional End of the Line (EoL) tests are insufficient in detecting faults during process resulting in increased manufacturing costs and lead times. The proposed methodology utilises a Knowledge Distillation (KD) approach to address the challenges associated with the technique and optimise the student model's performance by employing architecture search and data augmentation. Multiple SML algorithms were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in predicting faults during manufacturing. The random forest algorithm demonstrated superior performance due to its ability to handle complex data and identify the impact of interdependencies of process parameters on the final product quality. The method was validated by conducting physical experiments on a linear coil-winding machine, and the results indicated that the random forest algorithm has the potential to decrease simulation time from 2 minutes to less than a second. The proposed methodology has the potential to reduce manufacturing time, enhance stator quality, and ultimately improve their reliability and safety.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have novel features such as multi-stage penetration, highly-tailored intention, and evasive tactics. APTs defense requires fusing multi-dimensional Cyber threat intelligence data to identify attack intentions and conducts efficient knowledge discovery strategies by data-driven machine learning to recognize entity relationships. However, data-driven machine learning lacks generalization ability on fresh or unknown samples, reducing the accuracy and practicality of the defense model. Besides, the private deployment of these APT defense models on heterogeneous environments and various network devices requires significant investment in context awareness (such as known attack entities, continuous network states, and current security strategies). In this paper, we propose a few-shot multi-domain knowledge rearming (FMKR) scheme for context-aware defense against APTs. By completing multiple small tasks that are generated from different network domains with meta-learning, the FMKR firstly trains a model with good discrimination and generalization ability for fresh and unknown APT attacks. In each FMKR task, both threat intelligence and local entities are fused into the support/query sets in meta-learning to identify possible attack stages. Secondly, to rearm current security strategies, an finetuning-based deployment mechanism is proposed to transfer learned knowledge into the student model, while minimizing the defense cost. Compared to multiple model replacement strategies, the FMKR provides a faster response to attack behaviors while consuming less scheduling cost. Based on the feedback from multiple real users of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) over 2 months, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can improve the defense satisfaction rate.},

  abstract={Stereo-based 3D object detection, which aims at detecting 3D objects with stereo cameras, shows great potential in low-cost deployment compared to LiDAR-based methods and excellent performance compared to monocular-based algorithms. However, the impressive performance of stereo-based 3D object detection is at the huge cost of high-quality manual annotations, which are hardly attainable for any given scene. Semi-supervised learning, in which limited annotated data and numerous unannotated data are required to achieve a satisfactory model, is a promising method to address the problem of data deficiency. In this work, we propose to achieve semi-supervised learning for stereo-based 3D object detection through pseudo annotation generation from a temporal-aggregated teacher model, which temporally accumulates knowledge from a student model. To facilitate a more stable and accurate depth estimation, we introduce Temporal-Aggregation-Guided (TAG) disparity consistency, a cross-view disparity consistency constraint between the teacher model and the student model for robust and improved depth estimation. To mitigate noise in pseudo annotation generation, we propose a cross-view agreement strategy, in which pseudo annotations should attain high degree of agreements between 3D and 2D views, as well as between binocular views. We perform extensive experiments on the KITTI 3D dataset to demonstrate our proposed method's capability in leveraging a huge amount of unannotated stereo images to attain significantly improved detection results.},

  abstract={We propose a novel teacher-student model for semi-supervised multi-organ segmentation. In teacher-student model, data augmentation is usually adopted on unlabeled data to regularize the consistent training between teacher and student. We start from a key perspective that fixed relative locationsand variable sizes of different organs can provide distribution information where a multi-organ CT scan is drawn. Thus, we treat the prior anatomy as a strong tool to guide the data augmentation and reduce the mismatch between labeled and unlabeled images for semi-supervised learning. More specifically, we propose a data augmentation strategy based on partition-and-recovery N3 cubes cross-and within-labeled and unlabeled images. Our strategy encourages unlabeled images to learn organ semantics in relative locations from the labeled images (cross-branch) and enhances the learning ability for small organs (within-branch). For within-branch, we further propose to refine the quality of pseudo labels by blending the learned representations from small cubes to incorporate local attributes. Our method is termed as MagicNet, since it treats the CT volume as a magic-cube and N3-cube partition-and-recovery process matches with the rule of playing a magic-cube. Extensive experiments on two public CT multi-organ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MagicNet, and noticeably outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image segmentation approaches, with + 7% DSC improvement on MACT dataset with 10% labeled images.

  abstract={We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework for effectively teaching a sensorimotor student agent to drive from the supervision of a privileged teacher agent. Current distillation for sensorimotor agents methods tend to result in suboptimal learned driving behavior by the student, which we hypothesize is due to inherent differences between the input, modeling capacity, and optimization processes of the two agents. We develop a novel distillation scheme that can address these limitations and close the gap between the sensorimotor agent and its privileged teacher. Our key insight is to design a student which learns to align their input features with the teacher's privileged Bird's Eye View (BEV) space. The student then can benefit from direct supervision by the teacher over the internal representation learning. To scaffold the difficult sensorimotor learning task, the student model is optimized via a student-paced coaching mechanism with various auxiliary supervision. We further propose a high-capacity imitation learned privileged agent that surpasses prior privileged agents in CARLA and ensures the student learns safe driving behavior. Our proposed sensorimotor agent results in a robust image-based behavior cloning agent in CARLA, improving over current models by over 20.6% in driving score without requiring LiDAR, historical observations, ensemble of models, on-policy data aggregation or reinforcement learning.},

  abstract={Test-time adaptation (TTA) intends to adapt the pretrained model to test distributions with only unlabeled test data streams. Most of the previous TTA methods have achieved great success on simple test data streams such as independently sampled data from single or multiple distributions. However, these attempts may fail in dynamic scenarios of real-world applications like autonomous driving, where the environments gradually change and the test data is sampled correlatively over time. In this work, we explore such practical test data streams to deploy the model on the fly, namely practical test-time adaptation (PTTA). To do so, we elaborate a Robust Test-Time Adaptation (RoTTA) method against the complex data stream in PTTA. More specifically, we present a robust batch normalization scheme to estimate the normalization statistics. Meanwhile, a memory bank is utilized to sample category-balanced data with consideration of timeliness and uncertainty. Further, to stabilize the training procedure, we develop a time-aware reweighting strategy with a teacher-student model. Extensive experiments prove that RoTTA enables continual test-time adaptation on the correlatively sampled data streams. Our method is easy to implement, making it a good choice for rapid deployment.

  abstract={Mean ensemble (i.e. averaging predictions from multiple models) is a commonly-used technique in machine learning that improves the performance of each individual model. We formalize it as feature alignment for ensemble in open-set face recognition and generalize it into Bayesian Ensemble Averaging (BEA) through the lens of probabilistic modeling. This generalization brings up two practical benefits that existing methods could not provide: (1) the uncertainty of a face image can be evaluated and further decomposed into aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty, the latter of which can be used as a measure for out-of-distribution detection of faceness; (2) a BEA statistic provably reflects the aleatoric uncertainty of a face image, acting as a measure for face image quality to improve recognition performance. To inherit the uncertainty estimation capability from BEA without the loss of inference efficiency, we propose BEA-KD, a student model to distill knowledge from BEA. BEA-KD mimics the overall behavior of ensemble members and consistently outperforms SOTA knowledge distillation methods on various challenging benchmarks.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={22732-22741},
  abstract={Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have been prevailing paradigms for large-scale vision representation pretraining. By reconstructing masked image patches from a small portion of visible image regions, MAE forces the model to infer semantic correlation within an image. Recently, some approaches apply semantic-rich teacher models to extract image features as the reconstruction target, leading to better performance. However, unlike the low-level features such as pixel values, we argue the features extracted by powerful teacher models already encode rich semantic correlation across regions in an intact image. This raises one question: is reconstruction necessary in Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with a teacher model? In this paper, we propose an efficient MIM paradigm named MaskAlign. MaskAlign simply learns the consistency of visible patch features extracted by the student model and intact image features extracted by the teacher model. To further advance the performance and tackle the problem of input inconsistency between the student and teacher model, we propose a Dynamic Alignment (DA) module to apply learnable alignment. Our experimental results demonstrate that masked modeling does not lose effectiveness even without reconstruction on masked regions. Combined with Dynamic Alignment, MaskAlign can achieve state-of-the-art performance with much higher efficiency. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/OpenPerceptionX/maskalign.},

  pages={12157-12166},
  abstract={When facing changing environments in the real world, the lightweight model on client devices suffers from severe performance drops under distribution shifts. The main limitations of the existing device model lie in (1) unable to update due to the computation limit of the device, (2) the limited generalization ability of the lightweight model. Meanwhile, recent large models have shown strong generalization capability on the cloud while they can not be deployed on client devices due to poor computation constraints. To enable the device model to deal with changing environments, we propose a new learning paradigm of Cloud-Device Collaborative Continual Adaptation, which encourages collaboration between cloud and device and improves the generalization of the device model. Based on this paradigm, we further propose an Uncertainty-based Visual Prompt Adapted (U-VPA) teacher-student model to transfer the generalization capability of the large model on the cloud to the device model. Specifically, we first design the Uncertainty Guided Sampling (UGS) to screen out challenging data continuously and transmit the most out-of-distribution samples from the device to the cloud. Then we propose a Visual Prompt Learning Strategy with Uncertainty guided updating (VPLU) to specifically deal with the selected samples with more distribution shifts. We transmit the visual prompts to the device and concatenate them with the incoming data to pull the device testing distribution closer to the cloud training distribution. We conduct extensive experiments on two object detection datasets with continually changing environments. Our proposed U-VPA teacher-student framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art test time adaptation and device-cloud collaboration methods. The code and datasets will be released.},

  abstract={Test-time adaptation (TTA) is the problem of updating a pre-trained source model at inference time given test input(s) from a different target domain. Most existing TTA approaches assume the setting in which the target domain is stationary, i.e., all the test inputs come from a single target domain. However, in many practical settings, the test input distribution might exhibit a lifelong/continual shift over time. Moreover, existing TTA approaches also lack the ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates, which is crucial when distribution shifts occur between the source and target domain. To address these issues, we present PETAL (Probabilistic lifElong Test-time Adaptation with self-training prior), which solves lifelong TTA using a probabilistic approach, and naturally results in (1) a student-teacher framework, where the teacher model is an exponential moving average of the student model, and (2) regularizing the model updates at inference time using the source model as a regularizer. To prevent model drift in the lifelong/continual TTA setting, we also propose a data-driven parameter restoration technique which contributes to reducing the error accumulation and maintaining the knowledge of recent domains by restoring only the irrelevant parameters. In terms of predictive error rate as well as uncertainty based metrics such as Brier score and negative log-likelihood, our method achieves better results than the current state-of-the-art for online lifelong test-time adaptation across various benchmarks, such as CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNetC, and ImageNet3DCC datasets.

  abstract={This paper explores the tasks of leveraging auxiliary modalities which are only available at training to enhance multimodal representation learning through cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (KD). The widely adopted mutual information maximization-based objective leads to a short-cut solution of the weak teacher, i.e., achieving the maximum mutual information by simply making the teacher model as weak as the student model. To prevent such a weak solution, we introduce an additional objective term, i.e., the mutual information between the teacher and the auxiliary modality model. Besides, to narrow down the information gap between the student and teacher, we further propose to minimize the conditional entropy of the teacher given the student. Novel training schemes based on contrastive learning and adversarial learning are designed to optimize the mutual information and the conditional entropy, respectively. Experimental results on three popular multimodal benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed method outperforms a range of state-of-the-art approaches for video recognition, video retrieval and emotion classification.},

  pages={16006-16015},
  abstract={Previous Knowledge Distillation based efficient image retrieval methods employ a lightweight network as the stu-dent model for fast inference. However, the lightweight stu-dent model lacks adequate representation capacity for effective knowledge imitation during the most critical early training period, causing final performance degeneration. To tackle this issue, we propose a Capacity Dynamic Distillation framework, which constructs a student model with editable representation capacity. Specifically, the employed student model is initially a heavy model to fruitfully learn distilled knowledge in the early training epochs, and the stu-dent model is gradually compressed during the training. To dynamically adjust the model capacity, our dynamic frame-work inserts a learnable convolutional layer within each residual block in the student model as the channel importance indicator. The indicator is optimized simultaneously by the image retrieval loss and the compression loss, and a retrieval- guided gradient resetting mechanism is proposed to release the gradient conflict. Extensive experiments show that our method has superior inference speed and accu-racy, e.g., on the VeRi-776 dataset, given the ResNet101 as a teacher, our method saves 67.13% model parameters and 65.67% FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy.

  abstract={Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims at distilling the knowledge from the large teacher model to a lightweight student model. Mainstream KD methods can be divided into two categories, logit distillation, and feature distillation. The former is easy to implement, but inferior in performance, while the latter is not applicable to some practical circumstances due to concerns such as privacy and safety. Towards this dilemma, in this paper, we explore a stronger logit distillation method via making better utilization of logit outputs. Concretely, we propose a simple yet effective approach to logit distillation via multi-level prediction alignment. Through this framework, the prediction alignment is not only conducted at the instance level, but also at the batch and class level, through which the student model learns instance prediction, input correlation, and category correlation simultaneously. In addition, a prediction augmentation mechanism based on model calibration further boosts the performance. Extensive experiment results validate that our method enjoys consistently higher performance than previous logit distillation methods, and even reaches competitive performance with mainstream feature distillation methods.

  abstract={Many data sets for supervised learning have been created throughout the machine learning era, and without a doubt, many others are in the evolution process. Graph neural network (GNN), the youngest artificial neural network technique, is also characterized by a need to have and see specific patterns that a model with a particular architecture might learn. The following lines describe the dataset consisting of graphs with nodes of information created based on simple Finite Element structural models (GF dataset) designed to explore the possibilities of a specific hybrid modelling technique suggested as a bridge connecting a Finite Element (FE) Method and a Graph Neural Network into an effective tool for the purpose to creating a Digital Twin of a mechanical system.GF Dataset had been briefly evaluated to set the initial benchmark. However, the designed experiment also showed the feasibility of solving multi-regressive tasks with standard machine learning techniques. As a result, the first urgent need to use graph neural networks for mimicking simple physical-based FE models was diminished. Regardless of the results, the GF dataset is still decisively determined as a valuable initiative to explore possibilities of GNN involvement not only in system control through digital twinning.},

  abstract={Stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) have been widely used as predictive models to model complex nonlinear systems due to their advantages in terms of easy-to-implement, fast learning speed, and universal approximation property. In many fields, however, the data generated by nonlinear systems are often characterized by dynamic time series and nonstationary, which result in the learner model with poor generalization performance. This article presents an online self-learning stochastic configuration network to improve the continuous learning ability of SCNs to model nonstationary data streams. The method can autonomously adjust the parameters and structure of the network according to the real-time arriving data streams. Specifically, we use a recursive learning mechanism to update the network parameters online based on the data acquired in real time. In addition, the structure of the SCNs is dynamically adjusted by sensitivity analysis and stochastic configuration algorithm to improve the adaptive and continuous learning capability of the network. A series of comparisons are carried out over two benchmark datasets and one practical industrial case from the wastewater treatment process to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has good potential for nonstationary data stream analysis.},

  abstract={Deep learning has become an attractive choice for indoor positioning systems (IPS) because of its ability to be more accurate in dealing with phenomena such as multipath and shadowing. However, mobile and edge devices in an IPS environment usually have limited resources, making deep learning deployment challenging. Our research aim is to implement knowledge distillation for a deep neural network (DNN)-based IPS that is lightweight in an edge environment. The first step in our research is to collect a dataset regarding IPS, which contains distance data to three beacons as well as the position of the mobile phone in the room and determines the location based on the two outputs, namely Position X and Position Y. Then we design knowledge distillation for DNN to realize the compression model. We prove our compressed model by comparing the student model with the teacher model and the student model without the teacher model. We use several test metrics, including accuracy, loss, number of model parameters (Params), and compression ratio (CR). The test results show that the accuracy of the student with the teacher model outperforms the student without the teacher model, namely 0.8 compared to 0.776 for Position X and 0.96 compared to 0.88 for Position Y. Our research concludes that our knowledge distillation model for IPS can perform compression with $\mathrm{CR}=10.2 \times$ while having better performance than the model without knowledge distillation.},

  abstract={Digital twin has become a widely discussed emerging topic in last few years, which is expected to bring a new revolution to the whole life cycle of complex equipment, including R&D design, optimization control and predictive maintenance. Using online real-time sensor data to realize model dynamic evolution, so as to map the state change of physical equipment faithfully, is the most significant feature of digital twin and is also one of the most important key technologies of digital twin. Lifelong learning is a feasible way to realize digital twin dynamic evolution. By using offline historical data and online real-time data, the digital twin model built in data-driven modeling manner can evolve continuously, therefore, the accuracy of predictive simulation can be guaranteed and improved. Simultaneously, to make a balance between the computation cost and dynamic evolution performance, we introduce the event-triggered scheme during online lifelong learning process. To sum up, a lifelong learning method based on event-triggered online Frozen-EWC Transformer Encoder for equipment digital twin dynamic evolution has been proposed in this paper and the real flight dataset of quadrotor aircraft is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation, a widely adopted model compression technique, distils knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model, with the goal of reducing the computational resources required for the student model. However, most existing distillation approaches focus on the types of knowledge and how to distil them, which neglect the student model's neuronal responses to the knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that the kullback-leibler loss inhibits the neuronal responses in the opposite gradient direction, which injures the student model's potential during distilling. To address this problem, we introduce a principled dual-stage distillation scheme to rejuvenate all inhibited neurons at the neuronal level. In the first stage, we detect all the neurons in the student model during the standard distillation period and divide them into two parts according to their responses. In the second stage, we propose three strategies to resuscitate the neurons differently, which allows us to exploit the full potential of the student model. Through the experiments in various aspects of knowledge distillation, it is verified that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches. Our work provides a neuronal perspective for studying the response of the student model to the knowledge from the teacher model.},

  abstract={The rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) penetration has led to more flexible and reliable vehicle-to-grid-enabled cyber-physical systems (V2G-CPSs). However, the increasing system complexity also makes them more vulnerable to cyber-physical threats. Coordinated cyber attacks (CCAs) have emerged as a major concern, requiring effective detection and mitigation strategies within V2G-CPSs. Digital twin (DT) technologies have shown promise in mitigating system complexity and providing diverse functionalities for complex tasks such as system monitoring, analysis, and optimal control. This paper presents a resilient and secure framework for CCA detection and mitigation in V2G-CPSs, leveraging a smart DT-enabled approach. The framework introduces a smarter DT orchestrator that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) based actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (LSTM-DRL) in the DT virtual replica. The LSTM algorithm estimates the system states, which are then used by the DRL network to detect CCAs and take appropriate actions to minimize their impact. To validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed smart DT framework, case studies are conducted on an IEEE 30 bus system-based V2G-CPS, considering different CCA types such as malicious V2G node or control command attacks. The results demonstrate that the framework is capable of accurately estimating system states, detecting various CCAs, and mitigating the impact of attacks within 5 seconds.},

  abstract={Recently, there has been increasing interest in the Source-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection task, which involves training an object detector on the unlabeled target data using a pre-trained source model without accessing the source data. Most related methods are developed from the mean-teacher framework, which aims to train the student model closer to the teacher model via a pseudo labeling manner, where the teacher model is the exponential-moving-average of the student models at different time-steps. Following this line of works, we propose a Run-and-Chase Mutual-Learning method to strengthen the interactions between the student model and the teacher model in both feature and prediction levels. In our method, the student model is optimized to run away from the teacher model at the feature level, while chasing the teacher model at the prediction level. In this way, the student model is forced to be distinguishable at different time-steps, so that the teacher model can acquire more diverse task-related information and produce higher-accuracy pseudo labels. As the training goes, the student and teacher models are updated iteratively and promoted mutually, which can prevent the model collapse problem. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract={Semi-supervised learning(SSL) is a data-efficient way in leveraging large-scale data without annotations and alleviating the dependence on labeled data. Mean-Teacher (MT) scheme with teacher-student model architecture has shown its effectiveness in semi-supervised medical image segmentation, where the student network learns from the teacher by minimizing pixel-wise consistency loss. However, existing MT-based SSLs still give rise to two main concerns: (1) limited learning ability of student network that neglects the union of local feature and global cues extraction which may impact the representation learning of variable objects. (2) limited knowledge-transferring ability of teacher network with only pixel-level consistency regularization that may result in inadequate and unstable guidance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning scheme, namely MedFCT, with two appealing designs: (1) A dual student architecture with parallel CNN and Transformer branches is designed for local-global feature extraction, where the full-frequency interaction between CNN and Transformer can be explored by a frequency domain cross-fusion (FDCF) module to learn complementarity of the two-paradigm features. (2) A comprehensive multi-level consistency regularization considering pixel-wise, feature-wise and class-wise information is presented to realize more effective guidance and knowledge transfer from teacher network. Experiments show that MedFCT outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on two public medical image segmentation benchmarks.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation enhances the performance of the student model by transferring knowledge from the teacher model. Moreover, the attention mechanism has been introduced recently to enable each layer of the student to learn knowledge from all teacher layers, which brings about considerable optimization. However, noted that features from different layers, such as shallow and deep layers, might have a big semantic gap, and compulsively aligning one student layer to all teacher layers would mislead the learning process. To tackle this problem, an effective framework called Semantic Stage-Wise learning for Knowledge Distillation (SSWKD) is presented in this paper. We divide all layers into shallow and deep stages, and only allow feature alignment within the same stage to alleviate semantic mismatch. In addition, with the observation that the performance of deep networks relies more on some key features rather than evenly on all of them, a crucial feature enhancement method based on KL divergence is then proposed for SSWKD, forcing the student to pay more attention to critical features of the teacher. Extensive experiments and visualizations show that our SSWKD outperforms other distillation methods on CIFAR-100 and COCO2017 datasets for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.},

  abstract={Network traffic prediction can serve as a proactive approach for network resource planning, allocation, and management. Besides, it can also be applied for load generation in digital twin networks (DTNs). This paper focuses on background traffic prediction of typical local area networks (LANs), which is vital for synchronous traffic generation in DTN. Conventional traffic prediction models are firstly reviewed. The challenges of DTN traffic prediction are analyzed. On that basis, a spatiotemporal-enhanced recurrent neural network (RNN) based approach is elaborated to accurately predict the background traffic matrices of target LANs. Experiments compare this proposed model with four baseline models, including LSTM, CNN-LSTM, ConvLSTM, and PredRNN. The results turn out that the spatiotemporal-enhanced RNN model outperforms the baselines on accuracy. In particular, it can decrease the MSE of PredRNN more than 18%, with acceptable efficiency degradation.},

In light of this, there is a growing need to model and monitor farming environments to precisely address local and global concerns. We propose in this paper a farm digital twin framework that was used to monitor dry-land crops: maize, soybean, groundnut and rajma (kidney beans) to forecast and validate yields using a process-model approach while studying the overall impact on various other fronts. Deep learning models were used for early diagnosis of disease and pest conditions with imaging that drove timely operations to minimise impact on crop growth.

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) and new developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enhanced technologies based on smart cities, such as smart transportation, smart healthcare, and smart environmental management (IoT). Artificial intelligence (AI) was used to build virtual Digital Twins (DT), which are exact duplicates of real objects. DT uses in the manufacturing and industrial sectors have been successful, but smart city applications are still in their infancy. The primary reasons for this delay are a lack of confidence and privacy concerns around the transmission of sensitive data. DT may be used in combination with Federated Learning (FL) to ensure dependability and privacy preservation. In order to facilitate governance in smart city applications and their adoption in circumstances where time is of the essence and lives are on the line, the primary goal of this study is to merge these two cutting-edge technologies. The use of technology, businesses now create better products, identify and swiftly fix physical issues, and realize value and advantages more quickly than in the past.

  abstract={Health Digital Twins (HDTs) are virtual replicas of a patient’s physical/actual data. The major setbacks for applying Machine Learning (ML) in HDTs are the lack of availability of patients’ data due to privacy concerns and Artificial Intelligence (AI) bias. Given these shortcomings, synthetic data has been leveraged to solve privacy issues and increase diversity in datasets. In this paper, we evaluate four synthetic data generation models namely, Gaussian Copula, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN), CopulaGAN, and Tabular Variational Autoencoder (TVAE) which are used to generate synthetic data for actual sleep data retrieved from a wearable device. Gaussian Copula performed best in capturing the correlation between the variables with the real data with a quality score of approximately 96%. Additionally, we evaluate the efficacy of the synthetic generation models by training five well-known ML models on the generated synthetic data. Our experimental results show that the ML models trained on the synthetic data achieve an MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of less than 10% in the prediction of sleep quality score. The results from this work indicate that synthetic data could be used for ML tasks while preserving the privacy of data subjects.},

  abstract={Innovative solutions are required to sustain the balance between energy generation and demand to achieve the desired efficiency in the power system and microgrid. With the recent advances in information and communication technologies that provide energy solution services based on big data analytics, machine learning (ML), and IoT technologies, the concept of digital twins (DT) has been introduced as a constructible active model to improve the security and resiliency of the microgrid. The DT is a reliable and economic microgrid technology considering its advantages of virtual real-time simulation, physical-based control, and constant monitoring. Moreover, DTs can predict future performance, energy consumers' behaviour, and a complex system's maintenance.

  abstract={Technology advancements in wireless communications and high-performance Extended Reality (XR) have empowered the developments of the Metaverse. The demand for Metaverse applications and hence, real-time digital twinning of real-world scenes is increasing. Nevertheless, the replication of 2D physical world images into 3D virtual world scenes is computationally intensive and requires computation offloading. The disparity in transmitted scene dimension (2D as opposed to 3D) leads to asymmetric data sizes in uplink (UL) and downlink (DL). To ensure the reliability and low latency of the system, we consider an asynchronous joint UL-DL scenario where the smaller data size of the physical world scenes captured in the UL will be uploaded to the Metaverse Console (MC) to be construed and rendered, and the larger-size 3D virtual world scenes need to be transmitted back in DL. The decisions pertaining to computation offloading and channel assignment are optimized in the UL stage, and the MC will optimize power allocation for users assigned with a channel in the UL transmission stage. To ensure the reliability and low latency of the system, we design a novel Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) structure, namely Asynchronous Actors Hybrid Critic (AAHC). The simulation experiments demonstrate that compared to the proposed baselines, AAHC obtains better solutions with a preferable training time.},

  abstract={Recognizing objects in low-resolution images is a challenging task due to the lack of informative details. Recent studies have shown that knowledge distillation approaches can effectively transfer knowledge from a high-resolution teacher model to a low-resolution student model by aligning cross-resolution representations. However, these approaches still face limitations in adapting to the situation where the recognized objects exhibit significant representation discrepancies between training and testing images. In this study, we propose a cross-resolution relational contrastive distillation approach to facilitate low-resolution object recognition. Our approach enables the student model to mimic the behavior of a well-trained teacher model which delivers high accuracy in identifying high-resolution objects. To extract sufficient knowledge, the student learning is supervised with contrastive relational distillation loss, which preserves the similarities in various relational structures in contrastive representation space. In this manner, the capability of recovering missing details of familiar low-resolution objects can be effectively enhanced, leading to a better knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on low-resolution object classification and low-resolution face recognition clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our approach.},

  abstract={Automatic building instance extraction from high-resolution (HR) remote sensing imagery (RSI) is crucial for urban planning and mapping. The dominant approaches are based on the full-supervised learning paradigm that requires a large number of labeled samples to train their models, which is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. To alleviate this problem, this study proposes a semisupervised building instance extraction method that integrates teacher–student learning and pseudo-labeling to improve the building instance extraction from HR RSI. Specifically, the proposed method consists of three modules, the hybrid data augmentation (HDA) module, the pseudo-label generation (PLG) module, and the contour refinement (CR) module. The HDA module is designed to enrich the diversity of labeled samples to optimize the teacher model. The PLG module generates pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to train a student model with pseudo-labels. Finally, the CR module is designed to refine the contours of buildings. Experimental results on three challenging public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance and exhibits great robustness at different proportions of labeled data and different building scenarios. This study provides a new approach for extracting building instances from HR RSI in scenarios with insufficient labeled samples and a methodological reference for various applications of semisupervised on RSIs.},

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as key components in providing flexible assistance in aerial spaces.

In this paper, we construct a UAV-assisted mobile network to provide efficient communication for all mobile users in high-density and high-traffic environments, at the same time, a digital twin-empowered dynamic resource allocation strategy based on online training with low communication overhead is proposed. Our proposal employs digital twin-empowered multi-task learning to meet various resource allocation requirements for different node types.

  abstract={With the continuous evolution of emerging technologies such as mobile network, machine learning (ML), 5G, etc., digital twins (DT) bursts out great potential by its capacity of data analysis, data tracking, data prediction, etc, building a bridge between the physical and information world. Meanwhile, mobile network is moving towards data-driven paradigm, the issue of data privacy and data security seem to be a bottleneck. As a result, federated learning (FL) and mobile network are deeply converging. However, the mobile network is time-varying and the parameters of FL-empowered mobile network is huge and continue to increase with exponential growth of wireless terminals, result in the failure of traditional modeling. In the mobile networks, DT is conducive to prototyping, testing, and optimization, enabling mobile networks to be modelled more efficiently in a virtual environment and thus providing guidance for practical application. To this end, a communication-assisted sensing scenario is considered in this paper with FL in DT-empowered mobile networks. More specifically, two communication-assisted sensing architectures are proposed to improve communication efficiency of mobile network, namely, centralized architecture of federated transfer learning (FTL) and decentralized architecture of FTL. For centralized architecture of FTL, feature extraction of sensing information is conducted by FL between partial nodes and central server while the remaining nodes are used to train the fully connected layers at the central server. Considering data safety during the communication between sensing nodes, a decentralized architecture is designed based on FTL and Blockchain, where the feature extraction module is obtained by the fusion of sharing model (by Blockchain) and local model. The performance of proposed schemes is evaluated and demonstrated by the simulations.},

Today, with the advances in intelligence, processing, storage, communication, and networking capabilities of IoT devices, we are one step closer to realizing the vision of Industry 4.0. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are now significantly more intelligent and automated with the aid of advances in Machine Learning (ML). Intelligent IoT (IIoT), Digital Twins (DT) and the advances in mobile networks are now paving the path towards decentralized self-managed CPS in the industry. DT permits mobile networks to provide adaptive and dynamic configurations for cooperative CPS. Moreover, trustworthy cooperation may be realized with blockchain. In this article, we present a blockchain-assisted hierarchical federated learning (FL)-enabled platform (HFL) for Industry 4.0. The solution integrates DT into CPS to accurately capture the characteristics of industrial IoT devices and assist in the HFL process. A two-stage FL algorithm is used that groups Internet-enabled factory machinery and their DTs into groups in accordance with their organizational structure. A global model is created for the groups from the averaged local models and the DT model in the first stage. During the second stage, federated aggregation is used to create a global model from the first-stage models. Blockchain is used to cross-verify and validate newly added blocks with the support of validator nodes.

  abstract={The advancement of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technology has resulted in the fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, enabling industries to enhance productivity. However, despite the benefits, there remain significant challenges, such as resource heterogeneity, communication efficiency, and data privacy, that limit the applications of IIoT in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare. In order to protect data privacy, Federated Learning (FL) has been suggested as a solution, involving the sharing of model parameters rather than data itself. Current FL applications, however, still struggle with cost efficiency, especially when IIoT devices with heterogenous resources are involved. To address this, this paper proposes Digital Twin (DT) enabled Asynchronous SplitFed Learning (DT-ASFL) for classification tasks in the e-healthcare system over mobile networks. We first develop SplitFed Learning to introduce communication efficiency in the e-healthcare system, sending only extracted features during the learning process instead of the entire learning model. This enables resource-constrained devices to participate in the learning process by allowing the participants to train a partial learning model. DT is then employed to provide real-time statuses of IIoT devices deployed in the system, enabling asynchronous model updates in SplitFed Learning. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of DT-ASFL compared to the existing methods.},

  abstract={Collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) is a new paradigm that allows cooperative peer offloading among distributed MEC servers to balance their computing workloads. However, the highly dynamic workloads and wireless network conditions pose great challenges to achieving efficient task offloading in collaborative MEC. To address this challenge, digital twin (DT) has emerged as one promising solution by building a high-fidelity virtual mirror of the physical MEC to simulate its behaviors and help make optimal operational decisions. In this paper, we propose a DT-driven intelligent task offloading framework for collaborative MEC, where DT is employed to map the collaborative MEC system into a virtual space and optimize the task offloading decisions. We model the task offloading process as a Markov decision process (MDP) with the objective of maximizing the MEC system’s total income from providing computing services, and then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based intelligent task offloading scheme (INTO) to jointly optimize the peer offloading and resource allocation decisions. An efficient action refinement method is proposed to ensure that the action selected by the DRL agent is feasible. Experimental results show that our proposed approach can effectively adapt the task offloading decisions according to the dynamic environment, and significantly improve the MEC system’s income through extensive comparison with three state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract={Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) is a promising paradigm that exposes Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) to road scenarios. In VEC, task offloading can enable vehicles to offload the computing tasks to nearby Roadside Units (RSUs) that deploy computing capabilities. However, the highly dynamic network topology, strict low-delay constraints, and massive data of tasks of VEC pose significant challenges for implementing efficient offloading. Digital Twin-based VEC is emerging as a promising solution that enables real-time monitoring of the state of the VEC network through mapping and interaction between the physical and virtual worlds, thus assisting in making sound offload decisions in the physical world. Thus, this paper proposes an intelligent partial offloading scheme, namely, Digital Twin-Assisted Intelligent Partial Offloading (IGNITE). First, to find the optimal offloading space in advance, we combine the improved clustering algorithm with the Digital Twin (DT) technique, in which unreasonable decisions can be avoided by reducing the size of the decision space. Second, to reduce the overall cost of the system, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is employed to train the offloading strategy, allowing for automatic optimization of computational delay and vehicle service price. To improve the efficiency of cooperation between digital and physical spaces, a feedback mechanism is established. It can adjust the parameters of the clustering algorithm based on the final offloading results in this clustering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on DT-assisted vehicle offloading that proposes a feedback mechanism, forming a complete closed loop as prediction-offloading-feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IGNITE has significant advantages in terms of total system computational cost, total computational delay, and offloading success rate compared with its counterparts.},

  abstract={Due to the distributed collaboration and privacy protection features, federated learning is a promising technology to perform the model training in virtual twins of Digital Twin for Mobile Networks (DTMN). In order to enhance the reliability of the model, it is always expected that the users involved in federated learning have trustworthy behaviors. Yet, available trust evaluation schemes for federated learning have the problems of considering simplex evaluation factor and using coarse-grained trust calculation method. In this paper, we propose a trust evaluation scheme for federated learning in DTMN, which takes direct trust evidence and recommended trust information into account. A user behavior model is designed based on multiple attributes to depict users’ behavior in a fine-grained manner. Furthermore, the trust calculation methods for local trust value and recommended trust value of a user are proposed using the data of user behavior model as trust evidence. Several experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The results show that the proposed method is able to evaluate the trust levels of users with different behavior patterns accurately. Moreover, it performs better in resisting attacks from users that alternately execute good and bad behaviors compared with state-of-the-art scheme.

  abstract={Ensuring reliable update and evolution of a virtual twin in human digital twin (HDT) systems depends on any connectivity scheme implemented between such a virtual twin and its physical counterpart. The adopted connectivity scheme must consider HDT-specific requirements including privacy, security, accuracy and the overall connectivity cost. This paper presents a new, secure, privacy-preserving and efficient human-to-virtual twin connectivity scheme for HDT by integrating three key techniques: differential privacy, federated multi-task learning and blockchain. Specifically, we adopt federated multi-task learning, a personalized learning method capable of providing higher accuracy, to capture the impact of heterogeneous environments. Next, we propose a new validation process based on the quality of trained models during the federated multi-task learning process to guarantee accurate and authorized model evolution in the virtual environment. The proposed framework accelerates the learning process without sacrificing accuracy, privacy and communication costs which, we believe, are non-negotiable requirements of HDT networks. Finally, we compare the proposed connectivity scheme with related solutions and show that the proposed scheme can enhance security, privacy and accuracy while reducing the overall connectivity cost.},

  abstract={This paper puts forth a new, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted, uplink, user-centric cell-free (UCCF) system managed with the assistance of a digital twin (DT). Specifically, we propose a novel learning framework that maximizes the sum-rate by jointly optimizing the access point and user association (AUA), power control, and RIS beamforming. This problem is challenging and has never been addressed due to its prohibitively large and complex solution space. Our framework decouples the AUA from the power control and RIS beamforming (PCRB) based on the different natures of their variables, hence reducing the solution space. A new position-adaptive binary particle swarm optimization (PABPSO) method is designed for the AUA. Two twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) models with new and refined state pre-processing layers are developed for the PCRB. Another important aspect is that a DT is leveraged to train the learning framework with its replay of channel estimates stored. The AUA, power control, and RIS beamforming are only tested in the physical environment at the end of selected epochs. Simulations show that using RISs contributes to considerable increases in the sum-rate of UCCF systems, and the DT dramatically reduces overhead with marginal performance loss. The proposed framework is superior to its alternatives in terms of sum-rate and convergence stability.},

  title={A Bayesian Framework for Digital Twin-Based Control, Monitoring, and Data Collection in Wireless Systems}, 
  year={2023},

  pages={3146-3160},
  abstract={Commonly adopted in the manufacturing and aerospace sectors, digital twin (DT) platforms are increasingly seen as a promising paradigm to control, monitor, and analyze software-based, “open”, communication systems that are expected to dominate 6G deployments. Notably, DT platforms provide a sandbox in which to test artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for communication systems, potentially reducing the need to collect data and test algorithms in the field, i.e., on the physical twin (PT). A key challenge in the deployment of DT systems is to ensure that virtual control optimization, monitoring, and analysis at the DT are safe and reliable, avoiding incorrect decisions caused by “model exploitation”. To address this challenge, this paper presents a general Bayesian framework with the aim of quantifying and accounting for model uncertainty at the DT that is caused by limitations in the amount and quality of data available at the DT from the PT. In the proposed framework, the DT builds a Bayesian model of the communication system, which is leveraged to enable core DT functionalities such as control via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), monitoring of the PT for anomaly detection, prediction, data-collection optimization, and counterfactual analysis. To exemplify the application of the proposed framework, we specifically investigate a case-study system encompassing multiple sensing devices that report to a common receiver. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed Bayesian framework as compared to standard frequentist model-based solutions.},

  pages={3690-3701},
  abstract={The rapid development of Internet of Things has led more realization of digital twins (DT), such as healthcare, smart homes, virtual reality, etc., gesture recognition is a fundamental component of DT. Its implementation can provide users with personalized services or improved human-computer interaction, such as smart home control, in-car interaction, etc., most of existing gesture recognition methods are based on vision or wearable device. However, the vision-based methods face the problem of privacy breach, whereas the wearable-based methods may bring inconvenience to users. With the wide deployment of Wi-Fi networks, lots of consumer devices are widely accessible in people’s homes. Motivated by the fact that Wi-Fi signal propagation can be affected by human motion, the opportunity to use Wi-Fi signals for gesture recognition can be further explored. However, the challenge is that the received Wi-Fi signal shows great differences when the same person performs the same gesture in different environments or different person performs the same gesture in the same environment. Therefore, the signal alignment across different domain needs to be solved. In this paper, we propose a gesture recognition system named Phase-Attention-based-Conv-CSI (PAC-CSI), which consists of two modules: data processing and gesture recognition. In the data processing module, we eliminate random phase noise in channel state information (CSI) and perform phase calibration. In the gesture recognition module, we feed the processed phase sequence into a lightweight deep neural network for gesture recognition. PAC-CSI can obtain the gesture category in about 200ms, which can meets the real-time requirements of DT. The gesture recognition accuracy of our proposed system in a single domain is 99.46%, and its performance across new locations, orientations, users, and environments is 98.77%, 98.90%, 97.54%, and 96.47%, respectively.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a key enabler for the intelligent-oriented evolution of mobile networks. With the rise of privacy concerns for enabling intelligent applications in DT-empowered mobile networks (DTMNs), federated learning has garnered wide attention due to its potential on breaking down data silos. However, the data privacy of federated learning is greatly threatened by emerging gradient leakage attacks, and the need for frequent knowledge exchange limits its training efficiency over resource-constrained DTMNs. To circumvent such dilemmas, this work first proposes a privacy-enhanced federated learning framework based on cloud-edge-client collaborations. Particularly, model splitting between clients and edge servers makes gradient leakage attacks computationally prohibitive, and cloud-side partial model aggregation provides hierarchical data utility. To improve the training efficiency of the proposed learning framework, we further establish its communication and computation cost models, and develop a DT-assisted multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based resource scheduler for joint client association and channel assignment. Finally, as a case study of intelligent applications in DTMNs, a human-robot collaborative nursing task is designed to evaluate the practical performance of our proposed scheduler. Experimental results show its superiority in saving training costs and preserving learning accuracy.},

  title={RADiT: Resource Allocation in Digital Twin-Driven UAV-Aided Internet of Vehicle Networks}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={41},
  number={11},
  pages={3369-3385},
  abstract={Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a promising technology for improving resource allocation decisions in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks. In this paper, we consider an IoV network where mobile edge computing (MEC) servers are deployed at the roadside units (RSUs). The IoV network provides ubiquitous connections even in areas uncovered by RSUs with the assistance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which can act as a relay between RSUs and task vehicles. A virtual representation of the IoV network is established in the aerial network as DT which captures the dynamics of the entities of the physical network in real-time in order to perform efficient resource allocation for delay-intolerant tasks. We investigate an intelligent delay-sensitive task offloading scheme for the dynamic vehicular environment which provides computation resources via local execution, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and vehicle-to-roadside-unit (V2I) offloading modes based on the energy consumption of the system. Moreover, we also propose a multi-network deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation algorithm (RADiT) in the DT-assisted network for maximizing the utility of the IoV network while optimizing the task offloading strategy. Further, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with and without the presence of V2V computation mode. RADiT is further evaluated by comparing it with another benchmark DRL algorithm called soft actor-critic (SAC) and a non-DRL approach called greedy. Finally, simulations are performed to demonstrate that the utility of the proposed RADiT algorithm is higher under every condition compared to its respective conditions in SAC and greedy approach. Consequently, the proposed framework jointly improves energy efficiency and reduces the overall delay of the network. The proposed algorithm with UAV relay further increases the efficiency of the network by increasing the task completion rate.},
