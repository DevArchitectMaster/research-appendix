  abstract={Network attack identification effectively secures Internet of Things (IoT) application scenarios. However, dynamic scene changes, attack feature reliance, high data dimensions, and challenges with spatio-temporal feature fusion frequently pose limitations to attack traffic identification in IoT contexts. Definitive intelligent IoT attack identification enables intelligent algorithms to extract attack features for application scenarios with fixed topological environments but cannot construct the intricate changes of IoT application scenarios. Through the dynamic acquisition, feature awareness, and deep learning, intelligent digital twin-based attack detection can address these issues and enhance attack identification for IoT threats. Thus, this paper proposed an intelligent digital twin method based on spatio-temporal feature fusion for IoT attack behavior identification. Firstly, feature subsets are selected based on information gain to reduce the dimensionality of IoT data with high traffic; Secondly, a parallel spatio-temporal feature extraction model is designed unlike the existing tandem model, which uses a simplified Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model to learn the spatial features of the attack, a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model to learn the temporal features of the attack, an attention mechanism to fuse the temporal and spatial features, and the (Deep Neural Networks) DNN to learn the combined features; Finally, the virtual instance space and topology of the attack scenario are simulated using digital twin (DT) to build a digital version of the complex system for IoT applications and tested in a simulation environment. Based on experimental results using the UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017 datasets, this paper shows that the proposed method can extract spatio-temporal features from network attack traffic and has a 5% improvement in test accuracy.},

  pages={3677-3689},
  abstract={The computer-aided system and chest X-ray images play an important role in the diagnosis of pneumonia, which are the main way of pneumonia diagnosis. The traditional deep learning models have achieved some success in medical images, which captures the potential features of the image by continuously sliding the fixed convolution kernel. The disadvantage of this method is that it cannot effectively capture the long-distance dependencies in the image, and it does not have the ability of dynamic adaptive modeling. Next, the high-quality labeled data of chest X-ray images are very scarce. In order to achieve high-quality artificial intelligence diagnosis, a large number of high-quality annotated chest X-ray images are required. In this work, based on technologies such as Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and Digital Twins, we built an intelligent IoMT platform for automatic diagnosis of pneumonia. For the digital twin of the lung, we propose an enhanced vision transformer model (EVTM) for analyzing chest X-ray images to determine whether the patient is infected with pneumonia. The EVTM model utilizes the vision transformer for training and inference on chest X-ray images. Then the EVTM model uses the variational autoencoder model for data augmentation, so that the amount of chest X-ray images meets the training requirements of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on the standard chest X-ray image dataset to verify the effectiveness of the EVTM model.},

  title={Digital Twin-Driven Collaborative Scheduling for Heterogeneous Task and Edge-End Resource via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={41},

  pages={3056-3069},
  abstract={With the interdisciplinary advances of mobile communication and edge computing, massive heterogeneous tasks are accessing wireless networks and competing for the edge-end computing and communication resources. Digital twin (DT), which establishes the digital models of physical objects for simulation, analysis and optimization, provides a promising method for network scheduling and management. This paper proposes a DT-driven edge-end collaborative scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous tasks and heterogeneous computing/communication resources. Specifically, multiple end devices (EDs) cooperate with each other to accomplish a complex job, where each ED can offload individual task to multiple edge servers (ESs) for parallel computing. By fully considering deadline requirements of heterogeneous tasks, maximum computing capabilities of ESs and EDs, computing resource estimation deviations of DT, maximum transmit powers of EDs and tolerable peak interference powers to coexisting EDs, we formulate a job completion time minimization problem to jointly optimize the edge-end task division, transmit power control, computing resource type matching and allocation. To solve this non-convex problem, we first reformulate it by multi-agent Markov decision process, where a compound reward leveraging latency reward and deadline reward according to the task criticality is designed. Then, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based scheduling algorithm, where Actor-Critic framework with estimation and target networks is designed for policy and value iterations. Meanwhile, a step-by-step  $\epsilon $ -greedy algorithm is proposed to balance exploration and exploitation, avoiding local optimal trap. Through offline centralized training by DT and online distributed execution by EDs, we realize edge-end collaborative computing for heterogeneous tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, comparing with typical benchmark algorithms, the proposed algorithm converges with the highest reward and achieves the smallest job completion time, where the deadlines of heterogeneous tasks can be well satisfied respectively.},

  pages={3095-3110},
  abstract={To meet the future demands for ubiquitous communication coverage and temporary / unexpected computing resources, aerial computing networks have been envisioned as a new paradigm. Nevertheless, dynamic changes on the network make it particularly challenging to achieve global optimal resource allocation. As an emerging technology, digital twin (DT) can represent real objects in physical network by creating virtual models. With the help of DT, we can easily obtain comprehensive real-world high-fidelity state information for model training, so as to achieve intelligent efficient decision-making. Accordingly, DT-based aerial computing networks have emerged as a potential solution. Note that available researches mostly assumed simple ground user distribution like uniform distribution, and adopted binary / partial offloading in task processing, neglecting the task separability and data inter-dependency among subtasks. Toward this end, we introduce DT into aerial computing networks, and study the problem of intelligent UAV deployment and resource allocation. Specifically, we firstly propose a DT-assisted UAV deployment strategy and model the data inter-dependency among subtasks. After that, two DT-assisted hybrid (binary and partial) task offloading schemes are presented, i.e., heuristic greedy and DQN-based schemes. Extensive analysis and numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed DT-assisted UAV deployment and hybrid task offloading strategies.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT)-assisted mobile edge network can achieve energy-efficient task offloading by optimizing the decision-making in real time. Although many DT-assisted task offloading solutions in mobile edge networks have been designed, stochastic asynchronizations between the DTs and physical entities are still ignored. In this paper, we investigate a task offloading problem in a DT-assisted URLLC-enabled mobile edge network which considered the uncertain deviation between DT estimated values and physical actual values. Specifically, we formulate a latency and energy consumption minimization problem by optimizing task offloading, resource allocation, and power management. To solve this problem, we propose a DT-assisted robust task offloading scheme (DTRTO) based on learning composed of decision and deviation networks. The deviation network predicts the worst-case deviations based on the pre-decision, and the decision network optimize the decision considered the worst-case deviation. The simulation results show that, compared to the baseline algorithms, the DTRTO scheme can realize low latency and energy consumption in task offloading while maintaining high robustness.},

  abstract={The purpose of malicious traffic detection and identification in the Internet of Things is to detect the intrusion of malicious traffic within the Internet of Things network into Internet of Things devices. Detection and identification play a key role in ensuring the security of the Internet of Things. At this time, great success has been achieved with deep learning in the field of malicious traffic detection and identification. However, due to resource limitations such as computation weaknesses and low edge network node storage capacity in the Internet of Things, a high-complexity model based on deep learning cannot be deployed and applied. In this paper, we propose a lightweight malicious traffic detection and recognition model named Lightweight Knowledge Distillation-Space Time Neural Network (LKD-STNN) based on knowledge distillation deep learning for the Internet of Things. We use knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model by depth-wise separable convolution and BiLSTM to realize a lightweight student model and obtain multidimensional characteristic information. According to the characteristics of knowledge distillation, we propose an adaptive temperature function that can adaptively and dynamically change the temperature during the process of knowledge transfer so that different softening characteristics can be obtained during the training process. Then, the weight is updated by combining loss functions to improve the performance of the student model. The experimental results show that with the publicly available malicious traffic datasets for the Internet of Things, the ToN-IoT and IoT-23, our model not only reduces the complexity of the model and the number of model parameters to less than 1% of the teacher model but also reaches an accuracy of more than 98%, indicating that our model can be applied to the multiclassification identification of malicious traffic in the Internet of Things.},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={Accurately detecting objects in 3D point clouds is critical for achieving precise scene understanding in autonomous driving systems. Cooperative perception, through information exchange among neighboring vehicles, can significantly improve object detection performance even under occlusion. This paper proposes a novel cooperative perception framework based on multi-teacher knowledge distillation for 3D object detection, namely MKD-Cooper. First, we design a Collaborative Attention Fusion (CAF) module that dynamically captures inter-vehicle interactions through channel and spatial attention. By incorporating the CAF module into the CAF network, we effectively aggregate shared deep learning-based features from neighboring vehicles, resulting in a fused feature map that contains rich contextual information. Second, we propose an adaptive multi-teacher knowledge distillation method that adaptively assigns weights to different teacher models based on their current performance, effectively transferring valuable knowledge from multiple excellent teacher models to the student model. Experimental results on the OPV2V and V2XSim 2.0 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in detection accuracy while exhibiting excellent comprehensive performance between detection accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, field experiments in real urban environments further validate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  pages={3590-3602},
  abstract={The rise of distributed cloud computing technologies has been pivotal for the large-scale adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based applications for high fidelity and scalable service delivery. Systematic resource management is central in maintaining optimal Quality of Service (QoS) in cloud platforms and is divided into three fundamental types: resource provisioning, AI model deployment and workload placement. To exploit the synergy among these decision types, it becomes imperative to concurrently design (co-design) the provisioning, deployment and placement decisions for optimal QoS. As users and cloud service providers shift to non-stationary AI-based workloads, frequent decision making imposes severe time constraints on the resource management models. Existing AI-based solutions often optimize decision types independently and tend to ignore the dependencies across various system performance aspects such as energy consumption and CPU utilization, making them perform poorly in large-scale cloud systems. To address this, we propose a novel method, called SciNet, that leverages a co-simulated digital-twin of the infrastructure to capture inter-metric dependencies and accurately estimate QoS scores. To avoid expensive simulation overheads at test time, SciNet trains a neural network based imitation learner that aims to mimic an oracle, which takes optimal decisions based on co-simulated QoS estimates. Offline model training and online decision making based on the imitation learner, enables SciNet to take optimal decisions while being time-efficient. Experiments with real-life AI-based benchmark applications on a public cloud testbed show that SciNet gives up to 48% lower execution cost, 79% higher inference accuracy, 71% lower energy consumption and 56% lower response times compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.},

  pages={3401-3413},
  abstract={Mobile edge computing (MEC) enables various services to be cached in close proximity to the user equipments (UEs), thereby reducing the service delay of many emerging applications. However, the limitation of storage, computation, and radio resources, the dynamics of the decentralized MEC environment, and the complex spatial relationships of service request types and wireless network states between edge nodes make it difficult to realize efficient edge computing services. To address these challenges, this paper integrates the digital twin (DT) technology with a multi-cell MEC network to study an intelligent cooperative task offloading and service caching scheme, aiming at maximizing a quality of services (QoE)-based system utility. Specifically, we first construct a digital twin edge network (DITEN) to reflect the physical MEC system in real-time and provide data for training. With the help of DT technology, it is easy to access data resources in the DITEN to improve the simulation ability and reduce the communication cost. Then, we propose a graph attention-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (GatMARL) algorithm to learn the optimal task offloading and service caching strategies in the DITEN. The GatMARL employs a graph attention-based value decomposition network to capture the potential spatial relationships between edge nodes to learn better attentive cooperation policy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GatMARL algorithm exhibits an effective performance improvement compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT), Digital Twin (DT), and Federated Learning (FL) are redefining the future vision of globalization. While IoT is about sensing data from physical devices, DTs reflect their digital representation and enable optimized decision-making by tightly integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although swiftly growing, DTs are raising new challenges in privacy concerns, which are nowadays addressed by FL. However, the limited IoT resources, the communication overhead, and the lack of trust among clients are major obstacles that hinder the effectiveness of learning systems. In this paper, we design a new IoT-based architecture empowered by DT to improve the efficiencies of limited-resources devices. On top of this architecture, we leverage FL to construct the DT models. We further propose CISCO-FL, a Clustered FL with Intelligent Selection and Computation Offloading. Particularly, we study the computing resources of the clients and the quality of their models, and we embed in the proposed approach an intelligent offloading model, where the clients with high computational resources can assist and optimize the model of those struggling with limited resources. As such, both communication cost and computation resources are reduced and optimized. Finally, thorough experimental results are presented to support our findings and validate our model.},

  abstract={Due to the lack of sufficient labeled data, semi-supervised learning is an effective scheme to boost the performance of retinal disease classification. However, traditional semi-supervised methods are restricted by the strong assumption that the labeled and unlabeled images share the same distribution. In practice, labeled and unlabeled retinal images may have different style domains (e.g. different cameras) or semantic domains (e.g. different diseases). In this paper, an out-of-distribution (OOD) semi-supervised learning method is proposed for retinal disease classification based on knowledge distillation with a teacher-student architecture. To extract the information of the OOD unlabeled images, our method leverages the consistency constrains of both spatial feature representation and the probability learned from teacher model and student model. The performance and generalization of the proposed method are evaluated on the public databases including Messidor, REFUGE and iChallenge-AMD. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing semi-supervised methods.},

  abstract={Brain tumor segmentation based on multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a pivotal role in assisting brain cancer diagnosis, treatment, and postoperative evaluations. Despite the achieved inspiring performance by existing automatic segmentation methods, multi-modal MRI data are still unavailable in real-world clinical applications due to quite a few uncontrollable factors(e.g. different imaging protocols, data corruption, and patient condition limitations), which lead to a large performance drop during practical applications. In this work, we propose a Deeply supervIsed knowledGE tranSfer neTwork (DIGEST), which achieves accurate brain tumor segmentation under different modality-missing scenarios. Specifically, a knowledge transfer learning frame is constructed, enabling a student model to learn modality-shared semantic information from a teacher model pretrained with the complete multi-modal MRI data. To simulate all the possible modality-missing conditions under the given multi-modal data, we generate incomplete multi-modal MRI samples based on Bernoulli sampling. Finally, a deeply supervised knowledge transfer loss is designed to ensure the consistency of the teacher-student structure at different decoding stages, which helps the extraction of inherent and effective modality representations. Experiments on the BraTS 2020 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves promising results for the incomplete multi-modal MR image segmentation task.},

  pages={177-197},
  abstract={Digital twins for wide-areas (DT-WA) can model and predict the physical world with high fidelity by incorporating an artificial intelligence (AI) model. However, the AI model requires an energy-consuming updating process to keep pace with the dynamic environment, where studies are still in infancy. To reduce the updating energy, this paper proposes a distributed edge cooperation and data collection scheme. The AI model is partitioned into multiple sub-models deployed on different edge servers (ESs) co-located with access points across wide-area, to update distributively using local sensor data. To reduce the updating energy, ESs can choose to become either updating helpers or recipients of their neighboring ESs, based on sensor quantities and basic updating convergencies. Helpers would share their updated sub-model parameters with neighboring recipients, so as to reduce the latter updating workload. To minimize system energy under updating convergency and latency constraints, we further propose an algorithm to let ESs distributively optimize their cooperation identities, collect sensor data, and allocate wireless and computing resources. It comprises several constraint-release approaches, where two child optimization problems are solved, and designs a large-scale multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation shows that the proposed scheme can efficiently reduce updating energy compared with the baselines.},

  year={2023},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Digital twin (DT), referring to a promising technique to digitally and accurately represent actual physical entities, has attracted explosive interests from both academia and industry. One typical advantage of DT is that it can be used to not only virtually replicate a system’s detailed operations but also analyze the current condition, predict the future behavior, and refine the control optimization. Although DT has been widely implemented in various fields, such as smart manufacturing and transportation, its conventional paradigm is limited to embody non-living entities, e.g., robots and vehicles. When adopted in human-centric systems, a novel concept, called human digital twin (HDT) has thus been proposed. Particularly, HDT allows in silico representation of individual human body with the ability to dynamically reflect molecular status, physiological status, emotional and psychological status, as well as lifestyle evolutions. These prompt the expected application of HDT in personalized healthcare (PH), which can facilitate the remote monitoring, diagnosis, prescription, surgery and rehabilitation, and hence significantly alleviate the heavy burden on the traditional healthcare system. However, despite the large potential, HDT faces substantial research challenges in different aspects, and becomes an increasingly popular topic recently. In this survey, with a specific focus on the networking architecture and key technologies for HDT in PH applications, we first discuss the differences between HDT and the conventional DTs, followed by the universal framework and essential functions of HDT. We then analyze its design requirements and challenges in PH applications. After that, we provide an overview of the networking architecture of HDT, including data acquisition layer, data communication layer, computation layer, data management layer and data analysis and decision making layer. Besides reviewing the key technologies for implementing such networking architecture in detail, we conclude this survey by presenting future research directions of HDT.},

  title={Viewpoint Planning of Robotic Measurement System for Free-Form Surfaces Based on Visibility Cone Space Explorer}, 
  year={2023},

  pages={1-15},
  abstract={Free-form surfaces have been widely used in industrial design and manufacturing. For the requirements of measurement efficiency and precision, robots and optical scanners are applied to measure free-form surface parts increasingly. Due to the complex geometry shapes and occlusions of these parts, how to plan accessible viewpoints of a scanner to achieve the expected coverage rate is a challenging task. This paper presents a novel viewpoint planning method based on the visibility cone space explorer (VP-VCSE) for robotic measurement systems with 7 degrees of freedom (7-DOF). A digital twin for the robotic measurement system is implemented to provide core services for robotic measurement tasks, including sensor simulation and collision detection. To generate initial candidate viewpoints, a novel mesh segmentation algorithm based on the hybrid mixture model is proposed, which is convenient to handle the triangular mesh of the target object. Visibility computation for a target object in given viewpoints is the key to dealing with the occlusion problem. For this purpose, a general visibility model of a structured-light scanner is presented to compute visible areas accurately. In order to reduce occlusions, a visibility cone space explorer is designed to search optimal candidate viewpoints considering inverse kinematics and physical collisions simultaneously. The viewpoint planning problem is formulated as a set covering optimization problem and a next-best-view operator is introduced to improve the efficiency of the genetic algorithm for searching the resultant viewpoint set, guaranteeing the expected coverage rate and data overlap rate. The simulation and experiment results for four different test models show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods in terms of the uncovered rate and the minimum number of viewpoints. Note to Practitioners—This paper addressed a viewpoint planning problem for the robotic measurement system with a binocular structured light 3D scanner mounted on the end effector of the robot, where a robot and a turntable cooperate to complete the measurement tasks. The goal is to find a minimal number of viewpoints that provides full coverage of the target surfaces. Although many studies have addressed this problem, there is little discussion about strategies to improve coverage rate when the target object has complex occlusions. This paper suggested a valuable practice to construct a visibility cone space to adjust viewpoint to reduce occlusions and improve the overall coverage rate. Simulation and experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. This paper showed how to deal with various constraints that a feasible viewpoint needs to satisfy in the viewpoint generation, viewpoint adjustment, and viewpoint selection phase. Moreover, this paper provided a solution for developing the visualization, simulation, and interaction of a digital twin for the 7-DOF robotic measurement system. All core services for robotic measurement tasks are implemented based on a set of open source libraries, which provides a convenient learning and research software platform for practitioners. In future research, we will study how to improve the intelligence and cooperation of the robotic measurement system through deep learning or reinforcement learning techniques.},

  abstract={The industrial Internet of Things (IoT) system is integrated with the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms to empower industrial automation and self-evolving capabilities. AI-driven resource allocation across cyber-physical domains for mobile industrial IoT must consider its fundamental requirements and key characteristics such as high reliability, low latency, and environmental dynamics. The challenge is twofold. Industrial systems are fault-sensitive, which makes them intolerable of trial-and-error-based learning and optimization approaches. In addition, learning models cannot adapt to changing industrial IoT environment with dynamic communication noise and machinery disturbances. In this paper, we propose joint optimization for the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and multi-tier hybrid cloud-edge computing empowered industrial IoT that results in improved utilization of communication and computing resources. Second, we establish the fine-grained digital twin for industrial IoT (DT-IIoT) to simulate the changing industrial environment to support trial-and-error-based safe learning. Third, we leverage meta reinforcement learning (meta RL) to improve the generalization and fast adaptation of the learning models for DT-IIoT. Finally, the feasibility and efficiency of these schemes are evaluated through extensive experiments.},

  abstract={Digital twin (DT) is becoming a promising solution for vehicular networks to improve the interoperability of distributed autonomous driving systems. Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been introduced to provide low-latency services for DT-enabled vehicular networks at the edge of the network. However, it is hard to obtain the dynamic network topology for moving vehicles by the ground-based MEC system, which may deteriorate the service quality for DT synchronization. In this paper, we propose a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted synchronization framework for DT-enabled vehicular networks. With the proposed framework, an intelligent resource allocation algorithm is developed to improve UAV resource utilization and maximize the synchronization completion ratio. By leveraging an advantage actor-critic (A2C) algorithm, the synchronization decisions are obtained with low time complexity. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the synchronization latency and improve the synchronization completion ratio effectively.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={In this paper, we design a 3D map management scheme for edge-assisted mobile augmented reality (MAR) to support the pose estimation of individual MAR device, which uploads camera frames to an edge server. Our objective is to minimize the pose estimation uncertainty of the MAR device by periodically selecting a proper set of camera frames for uploading to update the 3D map. To address the challenges of the dynamic uplink data rate and the time-varying pose of the MAR device, we propose a digital twin (DT)-based approach to 3D map management. First, a DT is created for the MAR device, which emulates 3D map management based on predicting subsequent camera frames. Second, a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithm is developed, utilizing the data collected from both the actual and the emulated data to manage the 3D map. With extensive emulated data provided by the DT, the MBRL algorithm can quickly provide an adaptive map management policy in a highly dynamic environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DT-based 3D map management outperforms benchmark schemes by achieving lower pose estimation uncertainty and higher data efficiency in dynamic environments.},

  abstract={The Digital twin based Healthcare System is a demanding issue that can introduce improvements in the life of the elderly and disabled people living in remote places. More recently, modern Digital twin based Healthcare Systems have gained more attention and invitations from people due to the popularity of smart city establishment along with improvements in various healthcare services adapted in the smart phones. It is achievable because of the anytime, anywhere service access mechanism and machine-learning-based smart predictions over the cloud computing platform. The existing Healthcare System offers service to remote patients through continuous monitoring and tracking of physiological health records without live interaction and portability. Thus, the Digital twin based Healthcare System (DTHS) is proposed with smart virtual care facilities to enhance the earlier states of disease prediction and a patient-centric diagnosis mechanism from remote locations. Particularly, diseases such as Parkinson disease, identified as a severe neuro degenerative disorder worldwide, require such prediction and diagnosis at earlier stages. In this work, the experiments are focusing two voice based data sets namely DS1, and DS2 obtained from Kaggle, and UCI Machine learning repository. The proposed DTHS is developed over the cloud platform for Parkinson disease prediction using the Optimized Fuzzy based k-Nearest Neighbour (OF-k-NN) classifier model. It provides cumulative improvements against the existing Neural Network and Kernel-based SVM classifiers with respect to Prediction Time for DS1 as 0.00127 seconds, and DS2 as 0.00105 seconds, Prediction Accuracy for DS1 as 97.95%, and DS2 received 91.48%, F1-Score 0.98 for DS1, and 0.91 for DS2, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of DS1 got 0.93675, and DS2 received 0.79816.},

  abstract={New industrial paradigms, such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industry 5.0, are emerging in industrial contexts with the aim of fostering quality in operational processes. With the expected launch of 6G in the coming years, IIoT networks in Industry 5.0 ecosystems can leverage 6G technology and its support for training machine learning models using Digital Twins (DTs), embedded in DT Networks (DTNs), to transparently and continuously optimize their communications. Unfortunately, the use of these technologies, in turn, intensifies the attack surface and poses a serious threat to the new goals of Industry 5.0, such as improving the user experience, sustainability and resilience. This article therefore proposes a layered protection framework for 6G-enabled IIoT environments, where not only DTs and DTNs are fully protected, but also the whole 6G ecosystem, complying with the expected goals of Industry 5.0. To achieve this, the framework identifies for each protection layer a set of security and privacy services to subsequently relate them to existing computing infrastructures (cloud, edge, edge-cloud) and provide the best approach for future IIoT deployments.},

  pages={86-93},
  abstract={Future wireless networks beyond the fifth generation (5G) have been envisioned to increase many folds, in terms of key performance metrics such as latency, data rate, reliability, mobility, and user's quality of experience. However, one of the biggest difference between the sixth generation (6G) and its predecessor is the ability to support high speed connectivity of mobile services for global coverage, especially focusing on under-connected areas (e.g., forests, oceans, deserts, and mountains). Integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs) provide the best solution to unravel the unconnected issues of isolated areas not only on the ground but also in the air and on the sea. Despite this premise, the research in ISTNs is still in its infancy with many open problems, associated with long delay communications, large coverage for massive number of devices, and highly demanding real-time services. To alleviate these problems, this article introduces optimal multi-beam design empowered by machine learning techniques for 6G ISTNs, with respect to the real-time constraints of mission-critical services. First, we give an overview of the multibeam design for 6G ISTNs with user clustering approaches, energy-efficiency radio resource allocation, and distributed computing. Then, the frameworks for intelligent multibeam based on machine learning, real-time optimisation, and game theory, are proposed. As case studies, we investigate the performance of machine learning-aided real-time optimisation for 6G ISTNs in disaster relief and real-time optimal multibeam in satellite-terrestrial IoT networks. Potential research directions incorporating digital twin and quantum-inspired optimisation are presented to further support optimal multibeam design in 6G ISTNs.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) has brought new promises of efficiency in our daily lives by integrating AI with the IoT. However, owing to limited resources (e.g., computational power), it is difficult to implement modern technology (e.g., AI) and improve its performance (i.e., the IoT). Moreover, cyberthreats and privacy challenges can hinder the success of the IoT. This situation is aggravated by network scarcity (i.e., limited network connectivity). This article presents a digital twin-based data aggregation scheme in which data are collected using federated learning by operating a drone and stored securely in the blockchain. Before data sharing, differential privacy is realized to enhance privacy. A multirole training scheme is proposed, along with a duplex model verification architecture using a Hampel filter and performance check. To validate the specifications, an authentication scheme was implemented by combining a cuckoo filter and timeframe check. A case study to construct an experimental environment using real hardware is discussed. Different experiments were conducted in this environment and the feasibility of the proposed scheme was validated from the outcomes.},

  abstract={Human activity recognition is crucial for tactile internet, virtual reality, and digital-twin applications. Previous works have analyzed machine learning for this purpose but often need to pay more attention to typical challenges when deploying these machine learning models in production. First, data must be transmitted to the network node on which the machine-learning model is running. However, scaling human activity recognition by the number of devices and users puts additional constraints on the available transmission channel. While transmitting less data saves bandwidth, removing redundant information from the data can also benefit machine learning. This paper addresses the problem of transmitting wearable sensor data for human activity recognition. To this end, we analyze the extent to which wearable sensor data can be compressed via sparse coding without sacrificing loss in recognition performance. We empirically illustrate, on various datasets, that only a fraction of sensor information is relevant for human activity recognition.},

  abstract={Deep learning techniques are widely used for land cover classification in remote sensing, primarily because they can effectively extract complex features from imagery data, which is essential for accurate land cover classification. However, the heterogeneity of data can pose a challenge to the generalizability of deep models. To address this issue, we propose a novel transfer learning framework for land cover classification using teacher-student structure. The proposed framework utilizes the knowledge acquired by the teacher model from large datasets to facilitate fine-tuning of the student model on small datasets, which prevents problems such as overfitting resulting from training large models on small datasets and inferior performance arising from the limited learning capacity of small models. To achieve this goal, we design a loss function base on central moment discrepancy and high-temperature softmax. In addition, we conducted experiments on three distinct pairs of datasets and found that our proposed framework outperforms both training the student model from scratch on the target domain and simply fine-tuning the teacher and student models from the source domain to the target domain. Specifically, we observed an average increase in mIoU of 9.9%, 2.1%, and 4.3%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed framework for remote sensing land cover classification.},

Radar detection systems are preferred as they operate in all weather situations and during any time. Identification of UAVs threats is aided by knowledge of the number of detected UAVs and their directions. In this paper, a digital twin of a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar is used to detect a number of CAD replicas of various UAVs, and enable their simultaneous classification. Rather than resorting to complex measurement campaigns, a full-wave electromagnetic CAD tool was used to generate the digital twins, and the radar datasets which are then fed into machine learning classifiers. The proposed approach will enable antenna and radar system researchers to investigate an unprecedented plurality of possible scenarios when it comes to the use of radars for UAV detection and classification.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-15},
  abstract={This article explores the optimal offloading strategy in the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), which is challenged by three issues. First, the resources of edge servers are shared by multiple vehicles, leading to random changes over time. Second, as a vehicle would drive across consecutive edge servers, the offloading strategy needs to consider the overall edge resources along the trip. Third, at each vehicle, the computing tasks arrive continuously when driving. This dictates the offloading strategy to consider not only the current status but also the futuristic computing tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a digital twin (DT) network framework. A DT network maintains DTs in the cyber-space to synchronize the real-world activities of vehicles. Therefore, task offloading decisions can be benefited by combining both the global information aggregated from neighbor twins and historical information uploaded by vehicles. With comprehensive information, the optimal offloading strategy can be determined. We characterize the offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop an A3C-based decision-making algorithm, which can learn optimal offloading actions that minimize the long-term system costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the performance of our proposal in terms of fast convergence and low system costs when compared with other approaches.},

  pages={99413-99425},
  abstract={Precise and robust image segmentation is one of the most important steps in supervised deep learning-applied studies. Especially in the medical field, image segmentation requires an enormous time and professionals with clinical knowledge. Although there are constant attempts for automatic and semi-automatic image segmentation algorithm development, acquiring not only clinically accurate but also precise pixel-level annotations for medical images remains insufficient. This article presents a semi-supervised learning method with a novel fact-forcing process, referred to as FFSS, to reduce the labeling cost while improving the prediction accuracy for medical image segmentation. FFSS includes two components: a pre-trained teacher and a student that would be trained, iteratively. In each iteration, the teacher first generates a pseudo-label for each image in an unlabeled set, the student is then trained on the pseudo-labeled set and sends feedback to update the teacher. A fact-forcing process is designed to improve the quality of the student model using a labeled set. We have comprehensively evaluated our method on both three-dimensional binary segmentation and two-dimensional multi-class segmentation. The evaluation results demonstrate significant accuracy improvements of FFSS compared with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. Due to the fact-forcing process, the proposed method consistently outperforms the other ones under various labeled data ratios for all benchmark datasets, including left atrium MRI, pancreas CT, ACDC MRI, and OCT. By refining the quality of student feedback with complementary supervised training, the proposed FFSS shows robustness under labeled data scarcity for diverse types of medical images.},

  abstract={Deep learning (DL) models for 3D object detection from point clouds have shown remarkable progress in various autonomous perception scenarios. However, the issue of catastrophic forgetting seriously hinders the deployment of these models in real-world applications where new classes are encountered over time. In order to address this issue, we present the Contrastive Co-Teaching Network (COCO-TEACH) framework for class-incremental 3D object detection. Our proposed framework consists of two teacher networks: a primary teacher network that detects old class objects in new data and provides them with pseudo-labels and an auxiliary teacher network that leverages the unlabelled objects in new data. The two teacher models transfer their learned knowledge to the target student model through a class-aware consistency loss. To enhance this transfer, a supervised contrastive loss is further incorporated into the loss function. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method against baseline methods through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets. The results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on incremental 3D object detection.},

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel generative meta curriculum learning method that trains the task-specific model (student) end-to-end with only one additional teacher model. The teacher learns to generate curriculum to feed into the student model for data augmentation and guides the student to improve performance in a meta-learning style. In contrast to the generator and discriminator in GAN, which compete with each other, the teacher and student collaborate to improve the student's performance on the target tasks. Extensive experiments on the histopathology datasets show that leveraging our framework results in significant and consistent improvements in classification performance.},

  abstract={In computer vision, considerable success has been achieved in image classification. Yet, real-world applications can be negatively affected by noise corruption, so a method for dealing with noise is crucial. Knowledge distillation that utilizes the knowledge of a teacher model trained on clean images to train a student model on noisy images is a promising technique because it can be applied without special modification of the classifier. However, clean images are typically not available for most practical uses. To address this issue, we proposed a novel knowledge distillation method without clean images. By leveraging a property of the feature extractor in the classifier that naturally removes unrelated features for classification, we perform a simple training of the teacher model on noisy images, under the assumption that such a teacher can provide pseudo-clean features. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve classification performance comparable to conventional methods, even without clean images.},

  abstract={With the development of commercial off-the-shelf hardware, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are promising to provide flexible edge computing services. In this paper, we investigate a digital twin (DT)-empowered satellite-terrestrial cooperative edge computing network, where computation tasks from terrestrial users can be partially offloaded to the associated base station (BS) edge server, the associated LEO satellite edge server, and an adjacent LEO satellite edge server. We formulate a multi-tier computation offloading optimization problem to minimize the weighted sum of total system delay and satellite energy consumption, where a LEO-layer problem and a DT-layer problem are involved. The LEO-layer problem optimizes the three-tier computation resource allocation and task splitting ratio. From the multi-satellite network perspective, the DT-layer problem optimizes how many resources will be shared between adjacent satellites. We then propose a multi-agent double actors twin delayed deterministic policy gradient (MA-DATD3) algorithm to optimize the LEO-layer problem, and adopt a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm. The proposed MA-DATD3 algorithm is extended to solve the DT-layer problem in a centralized way, and the resource sharing between adjacent satellites is optimized to maximize the time-averaged reward. Simulation results show that our algorithm achieves a better performance than the MADDPG algorithm, and effectively improves the computation offloading performance while balancing the energy consumption and the total delay.},

  abstract={In recent years, we have seen the success of deep video enhancement models. However, the performance improvement of new methods has gradually entered a bottleneck period. Optimizing model structures or increasing training data brings less and less improvement. We argue that existing models with advanced structures have not fully demonstrated their performance and demand further exploration. In this study, we statistically analyze the relationship between motion estimation accuracy and video interpolation quality of existing video frame interpolation methods, and find that only supervising the final output leads to inaccurate motion and further affects the interpolation performance. Based on this important observation, we propose a general motion distillation framework that can be widely applied to flow-based and kernel-based video frame interpolation methods. Specifically, we begin by training a teacher model, which uses the ground-truth target frame and adjacent frames to estimate motion. These motion estimates then guide the training of a student model for video frame interpolation. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing performance across diverse advanced video interpolation model structures. For example, after applying our motion distillation framework, the CtxSyn model achieves a PSNR gain of 3.047dB.},

  abstract={An interactive scientific simulation and visualization pipeline in mixed reality was developed to explore how scientific simulation could proceed in coming workplace. The main technical concern is fast scientific simulator and visualizer in mixed reality with hand gesture. Framework for scientific simulation and visualization was implemented on the server side based on deep learning based fast simulation model and open source visualization toolkit, VTK, respectively. Airfoil aerodynamics was selected as a target scientific simulation task since it is a representative and critical problem in scientific fluid simulation determining the whole aero-product’s performance and shows highly nonlinear physics even by small shape deviation and so high computational cost. Therefore, the fast simulator was firstly developed by carefully developing convolutional neural network-based model, using U-net, which learned corresponding high accuracy simulation dataset. All scenes which are supposed to be seen on the mobile device side were authored in a widely used content development tool called Unity3D with a mixed reality toolkit, MRTK for Microsoft Hololens 2. User interface and user experience were created based on a scenario of a drone rotor which demonstrates running and analyzing the simulation results using designed interaction gestures. Finally, several discussions were derived through the implemented digital twin pipeline. It was concluded, with an adequately implemented mixed reality tools, that scientific researchers or industrial engineers will be helped not only in individual analysis works due to the delicacy of hands and fingers and real time interaction in mixed reality, but also, as a future study, in cooperative analysis works.},

  abstract={With the continuous development of information technologies, the digital twin has become one of the hot spots in recent years. In a digital twin system, the mathematical model of the control plant is mostly obtained from the derivation and computation of the mechanism model in the current remote virtual simulation. But in physical systems, the parameters primarily depend on the state of the system. A mathematical model for a physical system with time-varying characteristics is therefore inappropriate. Simultaneously, based on online identification and prediction, experiments were developed to carry out interdisciplinary comprehensive experimental education and conform with the growth of the engineering disciplines. In this paper, an online DT-based DC motor system is present. A five-dimension model of the DT system is designed and implemented with the physical DC motor system, DT 3D model, mathematical model, real-time data, and the online DT platform. The model parameters can be calculated and the future state can be predicted using the online identification and prediction method. Experiments show the stability of the DT architecture. The DT-predicted output can be consistent with the physical device output. Additionally, under certain circumstances, DT systems can take the place of the physical data in order to maintain the system's functionality.},

  abstract={Knowledge distillation is a hot research topic in the field of deep learning model compression. Knowledge distillation aims to transfer knowledge from a larger and optimised teacher network to a smaller learnable network and is important for improving the accuracy of student models. Existing KD methods typically consider privileged information about the similarity/consistency between the class distribution or intermediate feature representations of the teacher and student models. However directly driving the student model to simulate the features of the teacher model largely ignores the knowledge/features that are not found in the student model learning the teacher model. In this paper we propose a new inter-channel correlation framework for knowledge extraction (IE-ICKD) that divides the student model into two parts, inheritance and exploration, where the inheritance part has transferred existing learning knowledge from the teacher model to the student model by simulating the feature space of the teacher model, while the exploration part is assigned to learn the feature space not learned by the simulated teacher model. Extensive experiments have shown that our proposed model enables better performance of the student model on the CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10 datasets, and it outperforms many existing methods. We achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 74.12% by choosing ResNet110 as the teacher and ResNet32 as the student, which is very close to the 74.31% of the teacher model, achieving distillation and demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract={Digital Twin (DT) in Healthcare 4.0 (H4.0) presents a digital model of the patient with all its biological properties and characteristics. One of the application areas is patient respiration monitoring for enhanced patient care and decision support to healthcare professionals. Obtrusive methods of patient monitoring create hindrances in the patient’s daily routine. This research presents a novel Respiration DT (ResDT) model based on Wi-Fi Carrier State Information (CSI), improved signal processing, and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for monitoring and classification (binary and multi-class) of patient respiration. A Wi-Fi sensor ESP32 with Wi-Fi CSI was utilized for the collection of respiration data. This provides an added advantage of unobtrusive monitoring of patient vital signs. The Patient’s Breaths Per Minute (BPM) is estimated from raw sensor data through the integration of multiple signal processing methodologies for denoising (smoothing and filtering) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, SVM, EMD, EMD-PCA). Multiple filters and dimensionality reduction methodologies are compared for accurate BPM estimation. The elliptical filter provides a relatively better estimation of the BPM with 87.5% accurate estimation as compared to other bandpass filters such as Butterworth (BF), Chebyshev type 1 Filter (CH1), Chebyshev type 2 Filter (CH2), and wavelet Decomposition (62.5%, 75%, 68.75%, and 75% respectively). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to provide better dimensionality reduction with 87.5% accurate BPM values compared to EMD, SVD, and EMD-PCA (57%, 44%, and 44% respectively). Additionally, the fine tree algorithm, from the implemented 21 ML supervised classification algorithms with K-fold cross-validation, was observed to be the optimal choice for multi-class and binary-class classification problems in the presented ResDT model with 96.9% and 95.8% accuracy respectively.},

  abstract={Chronic respiratory conditions are a major public health concern worldwide and pose a significant burden on individuals and healthcare systems. Early detection of pulmonary diseases play a major role in treatment. However, existing diagnostic techniques can be expensive, time-consuming, and require specialized expertise and any misdiagnosis can lead to delayed treatment. Lung auscultation is a widely used diagnostic technique that involves listening to respiratory sounds through a stethoscope which provide valuable information about the respiratory system and help in the identification of pulmonary diseases. However, interpretation of these sounds requires extensive training and experience. In this paper, we present the ”Pulmonet” system, which has been developed to identify pulmonary diseases by analyzing lung auscultation sounds. The methodology employed involves knowledge distillation, where valuable insights from a large and computationally intensive model (referred to as the teacher model) are transferred to a computationally efficient model (referred to as the student model). Our approach involves converting the respiratory sounds into Mel spectrogram images, which can be processed by our system. The model’s task is to make predictions about the presence of pulmonary diseases in a patient and identify the specific disease if any (such as Pneumonia, Upper Respiratory Tract Infection, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Bronchitis, Bronchiolitis) or classify them as healthy if no disease is detected. Following that, the insights acquired by the initial model are conveyed to the student model, which possesses lower computational complexity, making it feasible for deployment on mobile devices. Finding the suitable loss function for student model is crucial and challenging in our work. The loss function should be designed to balance both knowledge transfer and preservation of student model. In our work we have achieved the accuracy of 82% in teacher model and 78% in student model.},

  abstract={As a real-time representation of physical entities in the digital world, digital twin (DT) has been widely used in many industrial fields, which has brought remarkable efficiency improvement and cost reduction. With the evolution of 6G network, the requirements for ultra-low delay and intelligence are gradually improved, and digital twin edge network (DTEN) came into being. DTEN mainly collects real-time information of physical objects through edge nodes such as BSs and APs, and builds dynamic models on demand based on these information, which has the ability of description, diagnosis, prediction and decision-making. Aiming at the traffic management and resource allocation in DTEN, a QoE-driven wireless communication resource allocation method based on DTEN is proposed, and the overall architecture design of DTEN system is completed. By integrating DT and RL technologies, the DTEN system models can be self-improved and dynamically adjusted, and the datadriven resource allocation model can be updated efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm guarantees a high level of QoE for users. Compared with Q-Learning algorithm alone, the proposed algorithm can support more users’ access under the same congestion performance and reduce the iteration times of the algorithm by about 70%.},

  year={2023},
  volume={61},
  number={},
  pages={1-11},
  abstract={Remote sensing object labels require high specialization, resulting in a limited number of labeled samples. Without large labeled samples to support training, general remote sensing object recognition models have limited accuracy. Addressing this issue, this article proposes a weakly correlated distillation learning framework for remote sensing object recognition with a small number of samples. Benefitting from large-scale natural image datasets, many recognition models achieve superior feature extraction capabilities. Thus, we use them as backbones to build teacher models, and then fine-tune the teacher models with a small-scale remote sensing dataset. However, due to the limited number of remote sensing samples, the teacher models may produce noisy features that reduce the performance of the student model. Therefore, we propose a weakly correlated distillation method that selects the weakly correlated features from teacher models to distill the student. Since the weakly correlated features contain different noise distributions that can be mutually suppressed, thereby improving the performance of the student. Extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets of DOTA, HRRSD, and NWPU VHR-10 demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with the state of the arts (SOTA).

  abstract={Manufacturing and industrial engineering education has encountered several challenges in addressing the educational demands of rapidly advancing technologies such as Industry 4.0, virtual reality (VR), digital twin (DT), etc. On the one hand, conventional laboratory facilities are unable to cope with this demand due to their nature of isolated operations. On the other, there is also a need to expose the students to concepts like Industry 4.0 and DT, where a virtual replica of the physical system is created and connected in real time. Therefore, this study aimed to establish DT connectivity between the physical and digital models of a conveyor available in a manufacturing system in a learning factory (LF). The integration of existing hardware with a simulated platform, utilizing an IoT-enabled environment and operating the hardware through VR setups, enabled seamless interaction between the physical and virtual realms, enhancing control, visualization, and optimization of hardware systems. Moreover, in addition to facilitating the DT, a VR platform has been integrated with the digital model of the conveyor system, enabling control of the physical system through a VR setup. The positioning accuracy of the conveyor carried pallet was tested for several locations, and results revealed that the digital model indicates the pallet position to the accuracy level of the nearest 2.5 mm. Furthermore, it could be concluded that the setup developed in this research could be used as an LF for engineering undergraduates to learn new concepts such as Industry 4.0, DT, and VR-enabled digital-physical integration.},

  abstract={The ECG and PPG signals contribute for the state machine learning logic and enables prompt diagnostic interpretation both in spatial and frequency domain. Analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and simultaneously PPG analysis is the prime research motive in clinical data processing. The valuation flow of diagnostic values for these bio signals mostly depends on quantity, accuracy, precision, speed, and real time signal evaluation useful for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Peak parameters of ECG signals like Heart rate (HR), Heart rate variability (HRV), Heart rate turbulence (HRT), T – wave alternans (TWA), Pulse rate (PR), Pulse rate variability (PRV), Pulse rate turbulence (PRT), Pulse transit time (PTT) are extracted using peak detection algorithm. They provide useful information about the cardiac vascular parameters. In this paper we have introduced a method for analysis of ECG signals in the mode of Peak detection. This method provides an excellent online diagnose pattern for cardiovascular diseases like myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest. By the fact that ECG signals shows a peak detected. The evaluated parameters both in Time and Frequency domain provide an accurate evaluation of the disorders. The machine learning algorithm for efficient power consumption is analyzed. Comparison of different kernels of Support Vector Machine (SVM) with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is also handled. The cloud-based analysis can be handled efficiently with the linear classifier such as SVM kernels and KNN classifiers. Comparing the performance metrics between the SVM kernels the Laplace RBF has more accuracy and precision than the other kernels. The KNN classifier is more precise and accurate compared with other classifiers. The energy, power, and time consumption of the kernels also compared the Laplace RBF takes consumes moderate energy and time and has higher efficient than other kernels.},

This paper elaborates on a methodology for creating DTs device independently deployed on arbitrary computing nodes with variable configurations tailored to its specific requirements.

  abstract={This article introduces the application of the improved K-means clustering algorithm in vocational Chinese education. Vocational Chinese language education is an important link in cultivating professional abilities and comprehensive qualities, and effective teaching methods and personalized teaching strategies play an important role in improving students' Chinese language proficiency. The application of integrated machine learning algorithms can help teachers better understand the learning characteristics and needs of students, thus conducting targeted teaching.Firstly, this article introduces the significance and goals of vocational Chinese language education. The Chinese language education in vocational colleges should not only cultivate students' language expression and communication skills, but also focus on cultivating students' professional literacy and comprehensive thinking abilities. Therefore, personalized teaching and precise learning evaluation are important directions for vocational Chinese education.Secondly, this article explores the application of the improved K-means clustering algorithm in vocational Chinese education. The traditional K-means clustering algorithm only considers the distance and similarity between samples, but in vocational Chinese education, it also needs to consider factors such as students' learning characteristics and background. Therefore, this article proposes an improved K-means algorithm that incorporates students' learning characteristics and needs as additional information into the clustering process, thereby achieving more accurate student grouping and personalized teaching.Then, this article introduces the practical application of the improved K-means algorithm in vocational Chinese education. By collecting and analyzing students' learning data and personal information, a student model is established, and an improved K-means algorithm is used to divide students into different groups. Teachers can develop corresponding teaching plans and personalized teaching strategies based on the learning characteristics and needs of different groups, to improve teaching effectiveness and student satisfaction.Finally, this article summarizes the application value of the improved K-means clustering algorithm in vocational Chinese education. By applying the improved K-means algorithm, teachers can better understand students' learning characteristics and needs, provide personalized teaching and learning support, and help improve students' language proficiency and comprehensive quality.},

  pages={1106-1111},
  abstract={Time series forecasting has been an active research area, particularly in the context of Digital Twin (DT) systems. Despite the excellent results yielded by pre-trained models in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), only a few studies have researched pre-training strategies for time series forecasting networks within DT systems. Recent studies demonstrate that transfer learning across multiple time series datasets does not always provide promising results, making self-supervised pre-training directly on the downstream dataset a temporarily considered optimal solution. To the best of our knowledge, the only general pre-training task in the time series field is the Masked Autoencoder. However, this approach may lead to redundant representations for downstream forecasting within DT systems. Therefore, we propose three pre-training tasks specially designed for time series forecasting within DT frameworks: Inverse Forecasting (IF), Coarser Forecasting (CF), and Anomaly Forecasting (AF). These tasks are respectively designed to capture bidirectional dependency, reduce noise, and augment data, all crucial aspects in enhancing the predictive capabilities of DT systems. By integrating the three tasks, we obtain a composite pre-training task which generally improves the forecasting results of time series models within DT systems across multiple datasets. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy and efficiency of DT systems, paving the way for more robust and reliable digital representations of physical systems.},

  abstract={Steel surface defect (SSD) recognition plays a critical role in guaranteeing the quality and economic benefits of industrial metal products. At present, deep-learning-based recognition methods have achieved excellent performance within related fields. However, these methods usually depend on the availability of extensive training data and label information. For SSD recognition, the SSD data are often insufficient and labels are scarce, making it hard to train a supervised deep model. In this article, we proposed a novel few-shot SSD recognition method based on self-supervised contrastive learning (self-SCL), which can effectively learn data representation with unlabeled data in the pretraining stage and learn categories from a few labeled samples in the fine-tuning stage. In this method, we proposed an information-guided teacher–student (TS) pretrained model with min–max instances similarity (MMIS) regularization. In the pretraining stage, we utilized the multicrop mechanism to build a teacher encoder (TE) with multiview information and leveraged the TE to guide the student encoder (SE) with information. Meanwhile, the SE also provided the TE with “questions” during the update process, which the SE also shared updated information with the TE for further refinement. Specifically, we introduced MMIS to address the problem of ambiguity between intraclass and interclass distances in SSD data. During the fine-tuning phase, we fine-tuned the pretrained model obtained by teacher–student with min–max instance similarity (TSMMIS) with a few labeled data and tested the SSD recognition accuracy in four SSD datasets. As the experimental results indicate, our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on the four SSD datasets.},

  abstract={The widespread deployment of the smart meters makes it possible to record massive fine-grained energy consumption data. However, the end energy users (e.g., prosumers) may tamper with their smart meters to mitigate the energy usage record fraudulently so as to reduce their payment, called energy theft. This behavior can result in poor energy management decision-making and economic losses for the power utilities. Therefore, it is pivotally important to take energy theft detection into consideration for ameliorating energy management. To this end, in this paper, an edge-assisted federated contrastive knowledge distillation (EFCKD) approach is proposed for energy management in terms of energy theft detection aspect towards a prosumer-based urban area, where gathering data in the power utility side is not required and the purpose is to achieve the average energy theft detection loss. Concretely, each client located on an edge server contains a local teacher model (LTM) and a local student model (LSM), where the LSM is a copy of the shared global student model (SGSM). The knowledge of each teacher network is distilled to teach the corresponding student network, while LSMs are collaboratively learned to update SGSM. In addition, model-contrastive learning is introduced to ameliorate performance. Experiments show that the proposed EFCKD outperforms the benchmarks since it can achieve the lowest average loss (0.0104).},

  abstract={Recent advances in sensing technologies, wireless communications and computing paradigms drive the evolution of vehicles toward intelligent and electronic consumer products. This paper investigates digital twins in vehicular edge computing (DT-VEC) via cooperative sensing and uploading of vehicles, aiming at achieving the quality-cost tradeoff in DT-VEC. First, a DT-VEC architecture is presented, and the digital twin system is modeled to reflect the real-time status of physical vehicular environments. Second, we derive the cooperative sensing model and the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) uploading model by considering the timeliness and consistency of the sensed information, and the redundancy, sensing cost and transmission cost of the system. On this basis, a bi-objective problem is formulated to maximize the system quality and minimize the system cost. Third, we propose a multi-agent multi-objective (MAMO) deep reinforcement learning model, including the design of distributed actors for storing replay experiences and a learner with a dueling critic network for agent action evaluation. Finally, we give comprehensive performance evaluation, which demonstrates that MAMO outperforms existing competitive solutions around 2∼5 times on maximizing system quality, while still saving system cost around 18%∼44%.},

  abstract={Autonomous system refers to a computer system that can operate independently, control itself and make decisions by itself. It does not rely on the support of external systems or software, and can complete various tasks and operations autonomously. Autonomous systems are often highly intelligent and adaptive in that they can acquire environmental information through sensors, analyze and process that information to make appropriate responses, and perform tasks without human intervention. Autonomous systems have a wide range of applications in artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, automated control and other fields, which can improve production efficiency, reduce costs, improve safety and reliability. However, most of the existing methods of autonomous systems are based on traditional machine learning or reinforcement learning. This paper proposes an algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to improve the learning efficiency of autonomous systems - LHU algorithm. The simulation dialogue experience is obtained from the interaction between autonomous systems and trainable user models. A posterior-session experience is the synthesis of successful session data by the posterior-module by acting on those failed session fragments and user goals. The dialogue experiences obtained from the user model and the posterior module provide more dialogue examples and positive feedback on dialogue strategy learning respectively. Finally, the reliability of the model is verified by experiments.},

  abstract={Container logistics in automated container terminals (ACTs) involves multiple interconnected operational processes. The integrated scheduling of these processes is crucial for the efficiency of the system. Current reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to interact effectively with the real world. Digital twin (DT) presents a promising solution to this challenge by providing real-time synchronized simulation. We propose a RL method enhanced by DT to address the integrated scheduling problem in ACTs. The RL model is trained in a DT-based simulation environment, which is more accurate and real-time than traditional simulations. This approach allows for easy transfer of the RL model to a real-world environment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we present an experiment in this paper. Our proposed method shows promising results and has the potential to increase container logistics efficiency in ACTs.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={In recent years, the increasing emphasis on sustainability and carbon footprint reduction has required the exploration of innovative optimization techniques for data center operators. In this paper, we introduce a Concurrent Carbon Footprint Reduction (C2FR) Reinforcement Learning framework, designed to optimize data center energy consumption, load shifting, and battery operation decisions in real time. The C2FR framework utilizes short-term forecasts and incorporates Reinforcement Learning Energy ($A_{E}$), Battery ($A_{BAT}$) and Load-Shifting ($A_{LS}$) agents to optimize and effectively manage the intricate dependencies and information exchange between these individual optimization strategies, thus overcoming the limitations of existing isolated approaches. When compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, the C2FR framework demonstrates its effectiveness across various data center scenarios. The AE agent achieves a 7.9% reduction in pollutant emissions and a 7.8% reduction in energy cost on average. Moreover, the C2FR framework enables further emission reductions through the application of the battery and load-shifting optimization, leading to a total reduction of 10.17% in pollutant emissions on average over different data center configurations. This highlights the potential of the C2FR framework in addressing data center sustainability challenges and improving real-time carbon footprint optimization.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={In recent years, the idea of teleoperating robots to perform manipulation tasks has gained popularity. Being able to take remote control of a robotic system performing an assembly task provides exciting possibilities for industry, not only operating the robot in hazardous environments, but also facilitating the accessibility of human workers, requesting help from a remote expert, or even teaching skills. With the rise of teleoperated manipulators, it is expected that tools that facilitate the interaction of humans with the remote environment will be more prevalent in industry, leading to a greater availability of them. This is the case with Virtual Fixtures (VFs), which are collections of abstract sensory information overlaid on top of reflected sensory feedback from a remote environment. Other ever more prevalent tools are Digital Twins (DTs), virtual representations of systems that facilitate bidirectional communication between the real and the virtual worlds. Being more likely than ever that factories have both an implemented Digital Twin of a system and VFs for a particular manipulation system, we propose a method to leverage both tools. In this paper, methods to integrate already existing VFs in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipeline and to use RL to construct an optimal VF to aid the human user in a telemanipulation task are proposed, tackling the cumbersome problems of reward function and VF design. The results show that this approach is able to correctly estimate the right parameters of predefined VFs and open the possibility to future work in this topic.},

  pages={852-859},
  abstract={Without a doubt, Food is a vital part of any Human's life, not only because of the nutrients provided but also the excellent taste. Subsequently, countless great people have invested their life in exchange for this enjoyment upon Human taste buds. However, even a three-Michelin-starred chef cannot remember the detailed steps to all the dishes, and ordinary citizens do not have the time or energy to create their recipes. This paper proposes an aid system that uses neural networks to achieve accurate recipe projections to facilitate life. A deep learning system based on Decoder and Encoder is implemented using CNN and Transformer. The CNN reduces the memory cost by transforming the image to a vector, achieving faster processing. The Transformer is used to determine ingredients' presence and combine the information of existing dishes to construct an instruction. Such a network can facilitate food production and research. It is making the creation of unique dishes convenient by revolutionizing the method of recording. After the model is created, the backbone network of CNN layers are manipulated to test for the best result. Backbone network tests include ResNet50, ResNet152 without attention, ResNet152 with attention, Vgg16, and AlexNet. Out of all tested, ResNet152 is resulted with the highest iou (Intersection over Union), and without-attention is chosen as it possesses less complexity than its counterpart. Then, knowledge distillation is applied to decrease the complexity and size of the model. This process used the complex model as a trainer to the student model by basing the student training on the result of the teacher model, achieving a similar level of accuracy with a significantly lower complexity and size. This decrease in complexity increases the portable capability of the model, potentially applying into applications and websites on devices in the future without consuming much memory.},

  abstract={One of the strongest needs of an Electric Utility is the in-depth knowledge of its assets and networks. With its Network Digital Twin® program Enel Grids put in place the basis for expanding and accelerating this knowledge to its deepest. A fundamental part of this journey is collecting, organizing, and processing the survey data coming from the field. Applying innovative and cutting-edge technologies allows to squeeze all the possible values from the collected data, put in place a real "data democratization" across all the organization and collect important benefits such as improved asset location and management, infrastructure health monitoring, predictive and fast maintenance processes, optimized network operation and emergency management. Hence Network Digital Twin® foundation layer leads to enhanced grid resilience and boosts data-driven decisions, playing an important role in terms of sustainability and achievement of Network carbon neutrality. Network Digital Twin® Foundation Layer is based on technologies that ranges from cloud and big data to cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence computer vision models based on machine learning, used to perform massive and automated extraction of electric networks features from the collected survey data. The survey data consist of 3D point cloud data from LIDAR sensors and images (RGB and thermal) collected within reglementary periodic inspection process using helicopter, drones, mobile mapping systems and terrestrial laser scanner. Survey data represents a frequently updated snapshot of the “real world” (the visible networks assets, both from the aerial network and from the Primary and Secondary substations) and it is integrated by additional satellite data. In this paper we want to share the main technologies that run "under the hood" and play a central role in the realization of the project, the challenges and problems involved with their implementation and their use, the lessons learned, the impacts of their use on consolidated business processes and how Enel Grids approached the systematic collection and management of the huge amounts of data that grows every day together with the integration of the Network Digital Twin® within its corporate IT solutions platform.},

  abstract={This paper discusses the employment of machine learning techniques to evaluate the voltage congestion on low-voltage distribution systems. Nowadays distribution network operators utilise computationally intensive digital twin models to evaluate the hosting capacity limitations. In fact, not all networks are incorporated into such digital environments. However, with the deployment of smart meters, new possibilities emerge that do not necessitate the modelling of these digital twins. In this work, end users' consumption data is utilised to predict emerging voltage congestion due to the rapid increase of electric vehicles and renewable energy sources. Additionally, not only does this allow to monitor the voltages, but it is also able to identify the grid standard violations. To this end, historical voltage profiles, power consumption and injection data derived from smart meters are exploited. All results are being validated through a power flow study applied on a low-voltage distribution network.},

  abstract={The assessment of Power Electronics Converters (PECs) reliability is a crucial research area for the development of robust PECs. The key parameter for reliability assessment is the real-time junction temperature (Tj) profile for semiconductor power switches of PECs. While complex high-fidelity simulation models with electro-thermal models can accurately predict Tj during the offline design phase, their computational requirements make them impractical for real-time applications. This paper proposes a methodology to develop a real-time hardware deployable model for estimating the junction temperature of an Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) power device.

  abstract={In this paper, a real-time leak source localization method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) of elastic wavefield images and spatio-temporal correlation analysis (STCA) is developed for the pressure vessel leakage. This method uses a single sensor array coupled to the wall to collect the elastic wave data excited by the leak source. Besides, the distance  $R$  and the direction  $\theta $  between the leak source and the sensor array are calculated based on CNN and STCA respectively, to finally obtain the location ( $R$ ,  $\theta$ ) of the leak source. In this paper, the digital twin model of the experimental platform is established, the training set is obtained by the finite element simulation, and the CNN model applied to the elastic wavefield images is studied and constructed. The experimental results show that the maximum locating error is 1.46 cm and the average locating error is about 0.56 cm within the range of a 1 m2 experimental plate based on the method proposed in this paper.},

  pages={28399-28410},
  abstract={In this article, we study the feasibility of a novel idea by coupling radio frequency (RF) sensing technology with correlated knowledge distillation (CKD) theory toward designing lightweight, near real-time, and precise human pose monitoring systems through an in-house experimental testbed development at Deakin University. The datasets collected from the developed testbed are fed to the CKD framework, which transfers and fuses pose knowledge from a robust “Teacher” model to a parameterized “Student” model and can be a promising technique for obtaining accurate yet lightweight pose estimates. As a result, it becomes possible to identify the current pose of a human body (e.g., an elderly individual in a care home) solely using RF signals (e.g., WiFi signals in a home) without relying on visual signals or video information, meaning that this approach effectively addresses privacy concerns by allowing pose identification without compromising personal privacy. To ensure its efficacy, we implement CKD for distilling logits in our integrated software-defined radio (SDR)-based experimental setup and investigate the RF-visual signal correlation. Our CKD-RF sensing technique is characterized by two modes—a camera-fed teacher class network (e.g., images and videos) with an SDR-fed student class network (e.g., RF signals). Specifically, our CKD model trains a dual multibranch teacher–student network by distilling and fusing knowledge bases. The resulting CKD models are then subsequently used to identify the multimodal correlation and teach the student branch in reverse. Instead of simply aggregating their learnings, CKD training comprises multiple parallel transformations with the two domains, i.e., visual images and RF signals. Once trained, our CKD model efficiently preserves privacy and utilizes the multimodal correlated logits from the two different neural networks (NNs) to estimate poses solely using RF signals.},

  abstract={The widespread adoption of consumer electronics devices coupled with the emergence of 6G technology has led to the establishment of an extensive network of interconnected devices, forming the underlying infrastructure of the Internet of Things (IoT). Nevertheless, this interconnectivity introduces a myriad of security concerns, given that these devices become susceptible to malicious activities and unauthorized breaches. Moreover, conventional intrusion detection systems encounter difficulties in managing imbalanced data scenarios, wherein the count of normal instances vastly exceeds that of intrusion instances. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for 6G-enabled consumer electronics device intrusion detection, leveraging the power of federated meta-learning and digital twins within a Meta-Verse environment. By leveraging the distributed intelligence of meta-learning across a network of devices, our framework enables efficient and accurate detection of intrusions while mitigating the impact of imbalanced data. Furthermore, by utilizing digital twins within a Meta-Verse environment, we create a scalable and controlled setting for experimentation, enabling the development and evaluation of intrusion detection algorithms in a realistic yet controlled manner. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in detecting intrusions on 6G-enabled consumer electronics devices. The federated meta-learning approach achieves superior performance compared to traditional intrusion detection methods, especially in imbalanced data scenarios.},

The successful implementation ofWeb 3.0 relies on dynamic perception and intelligent decision-making, which is difficult to conceive owing to the heterogeneity and dynamics of networks. Digital twins, as an emerging technology, can map the real-time network status and make optimal decisions to enable intelligent low-latency communications. This article introduces a digital twin architecture to achieve networking virtualization and digitalization for Web 3.0.

  abstract={Polarization encoded Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is attracting great attention as it generates unlimitedly and unconditionally secure keys for different use cases. Despite its theoretical excellence based on quantum physics, commercial optical devices supporting QKD systems lack precision, which highly limits the final Key Exchange Rate (KER) of the system. Beside optical component imperfections, eavesdropping and unpredicted environmental events occurred in the quantum channel increase quantum Bit Error Rate (qBER), which leads to further KER reduction. In this paper, we propose DARIUS, a digital twin for polarization encoded QKD systems that bridges the gap between perfect theoretical QKD systems and real implementations to: i) address optical components' non-ideal behavior; ii) discern eavesdropping from high qBER; and iii) dynamically compensate for environmental events. Taking advantage of DARIUS, even moderate eavesdropping rates can be distinguished from qBER. Moreover, significant improvement in proactive environmental event compensation is achieved, as DARIUS can derive proper optical component tuning.},

  year={2023},
  volume={41},
  number={10},
  pages={3191-3211},
  abstract={The high-speed mobile networks offer great potentials to many future intelligent applications, such as autonomous vehicles in smart transportation systems. Such networks provide the possibility to interconnect mobile devices to achieve fast knowledge sharing for efficient collaborative learning and operations, especially with the help of distributed machine learning, e.g., Federated Learning (FL), and modern digital technologies, e.g., Digital Twin (DT) systems. Typically, FL requires a fixed group of participants that have Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data for accurate and stable model training, which is highly unlikely in real-world mobile network scenarios. In this paper, in order to facilitate the lightweight model training and real-time processing in high-speed mobile networks, we design and introduce an end-edge-cloud structured three-layer Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, incorporated with an edge-cloud structured DT system. A dual-Reinforcement Learning (dual-RL) scheme is devised to support optimizations of client node selection and global aggregation frequency during FL via a cooperative decision-making strategy, which is assisted by a two-layer DT system deployed in the edge-cloud for real-time monitoring of mobile devices and environment changes. A model pruning and federated bidirectional distillation (Bi-distillation) mechanism is then developed locally for the lightweight model training, while a model splitting scheme with a lightweight data augmentation mechanism is developed globally to separately optimize the aggregation weights based on a splitted neural network structure (i.e., the encoder and classifier) in a more targeted manner, which can work together to effectively reduce the overall communication cost and improve the non-IID problem. Experiment and evaluation results compared with three baseline methods using two different real-world datasets demonstrate the usefulness and outstanding performance of our proposed FRL model in communication-efficient model training and non-IID issue alleviation for high-speed mobile network scenarios.},

  abstract={The important part of the learning process is practice and evaluation. Evaluation is intended to determine students' abilities so that the learning process can be improved according to student needs. Unfortunately, exercises and evaluations that are appropriate to the student's personality are difficult to do traditionally by teachers. In order to make the evaluation process easier and more personal, a system that is able to assist the process of training and evaluating students is needed. The adaptive training system allows the system to provide questions that can increase students' motivation and abilities. In addition, the form of the questions can be in accordance with the circumstances of the students. A methodology based on qualitative research using the Grounded Theory method was applied in this study. The proposed framework consists of several layers, including the User layer, Input Output layer, Model and AI/Machine Learning layers. Input Output can consist of a variety hardware. The model layer can consist of student model and domain model. The AI/Machine Learning layer can consist of item classification modules, student condition monitoring, questions recommendations, student performance evaluations, learning path recommendations, gamification engine, prevention action, questions generator. It is intended that the framework created would satisfy the proper evaluation requirements of each student in order to encourage learning and enhance student abilities. This framework is intended for use in secondary schools.},

  abstract={This letter investigates the resource allocation for digital-twin-empowered wireless body area networks (DT-WBANs). We consider a scenario in which multiple heterogeneous invasive and/or noninvasive biosensors are deployed to constantly monitor the patient's physiological signals and wirelessly communicating with a central hub to reliably transmit the sensory data in real time to a paramedic. Specifically, in order to maximize the energy efficiency of the biosensors guaranteeing the reliability of the emergency-critical physiological data transmission and modeling the nondeterminacy of the stochastic environment, we transform the problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) by jointly considering the transmission mode, relay selection, transmission power, and time slot allocation. Afterwards, a random graph-inspired deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is proposed to solve the problem and reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results verified the feasibility of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract={With the development of cutting-edge technologies and the efforts of business giants, Metaverse is becoming increasingly reachable. In addition to the fields of healthcare, education and cultural tourism, Metaverse will also have a profound impact on the power grid. The digital twin (DT) is regarded as the foundation of Metaverse, but its high cost hinders the broad application of DTs in power grids. In this paper, we propose a path to build the DTs in the direct current (DC) microgrid, which is a representative block in the future power grid with the penetration of renewable energy sources, forming Grid-Metaverse that can significantly reduce the cost and improve the interactivity. A model-based DT, which is originated from the physical model, and a data-driven DT, using the graph neural network with the data from the model-based one, are built together to illustrate this path and to show their roles in the Grid-Metaverse. Moreover, in the prototype tests, the threats of denial-of-service (DoS) and false data injection (FDI) attacks are validated through the developed DTs.},

  abstract={Developing realistic and interactive virtual environments is a major hurdle in the progress of Metaverse. At present, majority of Metaverse applications necessitate the manual construction of 3D models which is both time-consuming and costly. Additionally, it is challenging to design environments that can promptly react to users’ actions. To address this challenge, this PhD Forum paper proposes a novel approach to generate virtual worlds using digital twin (DT) technology and AI through a Text-to-Metaverse pipeline. This pipeline converts natural language input into a scene JSON, which is used to generate a 3D virtual world using two engines: Generative Script Engine (GSE) and Generative Metaverse Engine (GME). GME generates a design script from the JSON file, and then uses it to generate 3D objects in an environment. It aims to use multimodal AI and DT technology to produce realistic and highly detailed virtual environments. The proposed pipeline has potential applications including education, training, architecture, healthcare and entertainment, and could change the way designers and developers create virtual worlds. While this paper covers an initial work as per the PhD Forum’s guidelines, it contributes to the research on generative models for multimodal data and provides a new direction for creating immersive virtual experiences.},

  pages={365-369},
  abstract={Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely used to optimize the performance of multi-UAV networks. However, the training of DRL relies on the frequent interactions between the UAVs and the environment, which consumes lots of energy due to the flying and communication of UAVs in practical experiments. Inspired by the growing digital twin (DT) technology, which can simulate the performance of algorithms in the digital space constructed by coping features of the physical space, the DT is introduced to reduce the costs of practical training, e.g., energy and hardware purchases. Different from previous DT-assisted works with an assumption of perfect reflecting real physics by virtual digital, we consider an imperfect DT model with deviations for assisting the training of multi-UAV networks. Remarkably, to trade off the training cost, DT construction cost, and the impact of deviations of DT on training, the natural and virtually generated UAV mixing deployment method is proposed. Two cascade neural networks (NN) are used to optimize the joint number of virtually generated UAVs, the DT construction cost, and the performance of multi-UAV networks. These two NNs are trained by unsupervised and reinforcement learning, both low-cost label-free training methods. Simulation results show the training cost can significantly decrease while guaranteeing the training performance. This implies that an efficient decision can be made with imperfect DTs in multi-UAV networks.},

  pages={698-703},
  abstract={The digital twin and metaverse are actively utilized as media that contain immersive content in various fields such as entertainment, education, and manufacturing. When using immersive content utilizing these technologies, various interface methods are employed. Direct contact or wearable devices that can recognize user actions for interaction have physical limitations caused by the difficulty of accurately recognizing user movements and the use of surrounding equipment. Similarly, camera-based interfaces that recognize user actions have physical limitations due to wired connections to the main body and compatibility issues with other operating systems due to noncompliance to any global or national standards.In this paper, we propose a metaverse avatar teleport system based on user pose estimation using AIoT edge devices on the oneM2M IoT platform. The proposed system transmits the final human pose skeleton estimated by PoseNet to the Teleport Information Extractor after receiving the input image from the webcam. The teleport information extractor extracts four keypoints that serve as the basis for posture estimation for teleportation from the transmitted human pose skeleton and estimates one of the three postures for teleportation using those keypoints. The estimated teleport information is then sent from the IoT client M/W to the IoT server M/W.The metaverse interworking module, which is designed for integration with the metaverse, receives the Teleport Information through communication using HTTP and MQTT. And IoT server M/W transmits the teleport command corresponding to the received Teleport Information to the metaverse server, thereby repositioning the user avatar’s position and direction vector in the metaverse. This system is compatible with all devices that comply with the oneM2M standard and does not have spatial constraints when using content due to the use of network-based connections instead of wired connections.},

  abstract={In recent years, extensive research has been conducted to develop traffic surveillance and monitoring applications using advanced technologies in a Smart-City context. One of the fundamental challenges in an urban city scenario is developing an efficient yet affordable parking lot management system. Such systems play a crucial role in providing the necessary data to local municipalities to make informed decisions to better manage the traffic flow while saving valuable resources and time. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end system architecture for a real-time video-based parking management system that can be easily scaled and enforced in a Smart-City context. Using state-of-the-art object detection and tracking methods combined with novel Static Object Detection techniques, we demonstrate a localized strategy for identifying potential parking spaces. A separate parking occupancy classification pipeline is discussed which provides fast and accurate availability status of these parking spaces. Furthermore, a 3D digital-twin application to monitor and visualize the parking spaces is demonstrated. Our experiments in a real-world scenario demonstrate the significant potential of our proposed architecture to easily scale to a given city with minimal manual efforts and lower implementation costs.},

However, traditional rule-based solutions heavily rely on human efforts and expertise, while data-driven intelligent algorithms still lack interpretability and generalization. In this paper, we propose the AIGN (AI-Generated Network), a novel intention-driven paradigm for network design, which allows operators to quickly generate a variety of customized network solutions and achieve expert-free problem optimization. Driven by the diffusion model-based learning approach, AIGN has great potential to learn the reward-maximizing trajectories, automatically satisfy multiple constraints, adapt to different objectives and scenarios, or even intelligently create novel designs and mechanisms unseen in existing network environments. Finally, we conduct a use case to demonstrate that AIGN can effectively guide the design of transmit power allocation in digital twin-based access networks.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-11},
  abstract={Digital twin technology deployed in the industrial Internet of Things (IoT) will be unavailable because of data heterogeneity and data islands. As a machine learning approach for distributed architectures, federated learning generates a global model for edge devices by only transferring model parameters, and it ensures that the private data of each device is not leaked. This is naturally suitable for solving this problem. Because devices' data cannot be exchanged with other devices, one major challenge is learning an effective model among devices with heterogeneous data. Motivated by this issue, we propose hierarchical federated learning using a hypernetwork (HN) algorithm to alleviate the influence of non-IID data among the devices, including label distribution skew, quantity skew, and feature distribution skew. The lower layer of our method uses hypernetworks to generate the parameters of the local model for the devices, while its upper layer updates hypernetworks by aggregating their model parameters. It decouples the number of parameters transmitted by the upper and lower layers, and it achieves good accuracy while improving communication efficiency and reducing computation costs.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a teacher-student network for industrial anomaly detection tasks using knowledge distillation techniques, where the feature representation capabilities of the teacher network model are utilized to guide the student model in efficiently identifying anomalous images. In detail, the VGG model is introduced as the backbone network for anomaly detection. Meanwhile, a residual attention mechanism is proposed to improve the feature output capability of the student network. The student network is able to learn good feature extraction abilities due to the robust feature representation of the teacher network. At the same time, the residual attention mechanism enhances the student network's ability to characterize the output of normal data features, amplifying the feature differences between the student and teacher networks for abnormal data. In summary, this paper addresses the problem of difficult detection of small targets in anomaly detection. Experimental validation has been performed on the industrial anomaly detection dataset MVTec-AD, which ultimately achieved 96.70% and 97.94% results for detecting and localizing, respectively. Compared with the other anomaly detection methods, the method proposed in this paper achieves a significant performance improvement.},

We then analyze users' watching duration and preferences in each multicast group to obtain the swiping probability distribution and recommended videos, respectively. The obtained information is utilized to predict radio and computing resource demand of each multicast group.

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Emerging latency-sensitive applications (e.g. factory automation control, industrial metaverse, digital twin-enabled smart manufacturing) require that the networks ensure data delivery with a guaranteed low and bounded latency. Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) mechanisms have been developed to enable deterministic features in standard Ethernet. 5G and 6G networks are looking forward to integrate TSN and benefit from its ability to ensure determinism. Accommodating the complexity of TSN networks in 6G is not straightforward. In particular, conventional rule-based heuristic algorithms are not optimized for such environments. Therefore, the TSN network management framework should be equipped with the right tools allowing to compute at runtime new TSN configuration for each event (e.g. change in topology, new application, new device, etc.). To address this problem, recent standardization initiatives (IETF and ITU-T) have investigated the opportunities to use Network Digital Twin (NDT) paradigm for these use cases of 6G networks.This paper proposes a framework that puts together the key enablers to support NDT deployment for TSN-based public or private 6G network and to cope with the relevant challenges. In particular, we define a modular and self-learner NDT framework. To construct the DT model, the framework can rely on open source simulators/emulators with predefined models, or in other cases, it may learn the DT model from real infrastructure using Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) techniques trained over collected data. The paper also showcases how NDT, Software-Defined Network (SDN) and deterministic networks (TSN and DetNet) are key enablers for 6G network architecture.},

  abstract={In this research, we discuss the impact of combining model-based deep learning and game theory in dynamic games to develop a sample-efficient self-learning methodology for smart production systems. We propose a novel approach, namely Model-Based Game Theory (MBGT), by incorporating model-based deep learning into a successful self-learning strategy of State-based Potential Games. Most of the advanced self-learning approaches are established based on machine learning and artificial intelligence, including reinforcement learning and game-theoretical method. However, because of the iterative behaviour during the learning processes, the learning processes are almost impossible to be conducted directly in a real-world manufacturing environment. One potential approach is to conduct the learning processes using the digital representation of the systems, e.g. the digital twin or simulation. Nonetheless, such representations in industrial settings are not always available and developing a digital representation of a complex system is immensely challenging. Hence, this problem can be solved through model-based learning, in which deep learning models are trained to predict the dynamics of the systems with a small margin of error. Then, the trained models are deployed as virtual environments for the learning processes of the GT-based control policies, instead of learning in the real world. In this study, we implement MBGT to a bulk good system and thoroughly analyse the performances between training in the real system and virtual environment, which eventually turn out to be positive effects.},

  abstract={Current industrial communication systems (ICS) are undergoing a transformation, leveraging a multitude of technologies to meet the specific needs of the manufacturing and automation industries. The convergence of these networks into edge, fog, and cloud architectures has enhanced their scalability and facilitated the deployment of advanced data-driven approaches, such as machine learning for optimizing production processes. However, ensuring proper provisioning of network and computation resources, along with delivering quality of service, is increasingly challenging in these complex communication systems. Zero-Touch Management (ZTM) frameworks promise to reduce complexity and minimize dependence on manual configuration by human experts. Successful deployment of such frameworks requires an accurate Network Digital Twin (NDT) of relevant network elements, as autonomous decision-making heavily relies on the quantity and quality of historical and real-time node and link state information provided by the NDT. However, the use of NDTs for ICS and ZTM in particular is still an emerging research topic. This paper therefore proposes a theoretical use-case for an NDT-based ZTM framework to improve resource utilization in cloud-centered networks. It presents a state-of-the-art analysis of recent NDT advances enabling the deployment of related ZTM approaches and discusses associated challenges and future research directions.},

  abstract={Recent statistics and studies show that the loss generated by insider threats is much higher than that generated by external attacks. More and more organizations are investing in or purchasing insider threat detection systems to prevent insider risks. However, the accurate and timely detection of insider threats faces significant challenges. In this study, we proposed an intelligent insider threat detection framework based on Digital Twins and self-attentions based deep learning models. First, this paper introduces insider threats and the challenges in detecting them. Then this paper presents recent related works on solving insider threat detection problems and their limitations. Next, we propose our solutions to address these challenges: building an innovative intelligent insider threat detection framework based on Digital Twin (DT) and self-attention based deep learning models, performing insight analysis of users’ behavior and entities, adopting contextual word embedding techniques using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model and sentence embedding technique using Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) model to perform data augmentation to overcome significant data imbalance, and adopting temporal semantic representation of users’ behaviors to build user behavior time sequences. Subsequently, this study built self-attention-based deep learning models to quickly detect insider threats. This study proposes a simplified transformer model named DistilledTrans and applies the original transformer model, DistilledTrans, BERT + final layer, Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa) + final layer, and a hybrid method combining pre-trained (BERT, RoBERTa) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network model to detect insider threats. Finally, this paper presents experimental results on a dense dataset CERT r4.2 and augmented sporadic dataset CERT r6.2, evaluates their performance, and performs a comparison analysis with state-of-the-art models. Promising experimental results show that 1) contextual word embedding insert and substitution predicted by the BERT model, and context embedding sentences predicted by the GPT-2 model are effective data augmentation approaches to address high data imbalance; 2) DistilledTrans trained with sporadic dataset CERT r6.2 augmented by the contextual embedding sentence method predicted by GPT-2, outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of all evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Additionally, its structure is much simpler, and thus training time and computing cost are much less than those of recent models; 3) when trained with the dense dataset CERT r4.2, pre-trained models BERT plus a final layer or RoBERTa plus a final layer can achieve significantly higher performance than the current models with a very little sacrifice of precision. However, complex hybrid methods may not be required.},

  abstract={Developing affordable and efficient methods to utilize hydrogen from renewable sources is a crucial hurdle that must be overcome to achieve a low-carbon economy and industrial decarbonization. One promising solution is the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which is a commercially attractive fuel cell that can support the implementation of decarbonization techniques for the transport sector. However, the unstable operation and undesired degradation will significantly shorten PEMFC's lifetime, which is a serious barrier to its commercialisation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a digital twin-enabled online remaining useful life prediction method for PEMFC, based on the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network and the quantile Huber loss (QH-loss). Our approach involves using a digital model that can be learned from a short period of online monitoring data and then used to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) for upcoming data. By utilizing the proposed digital twin method, we can simulate the performance of the PEMFC in real-time, providing accurate and timely predictions of its RUL. We conducted experiments on PEM fuel cell test rigs, varying the length of the data period used to train our digital twin model. The results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that our approach can accurately predict the remaining useful life of PEMFCs, even when trained with a short period of online monitoring data.},

  abstract={Industrial control systems are excessively used in advanced manufacturing environments. The lack of information and data regarding the internal workings of certain systems makes virtual modelling for their Digital Twin challenging. As a result, these systems are often classified as “black box“ systems. There is minimal research found on DT models for industrial control black box systems. Therefore, a novel algorithm to model the Digital Twin of the industrial control black box system in the cyber domain has been presented in this paper. Machine Learning techniques were used to develop a high-fidelity Digital Twin model of a black box system. Real-time sensor data were recorded and used to validate the proposed novel algorithm. This paper presents the proposed algorithm's effectiveness in developing a robust Digital Twin model of industrial control back box system.},

  abstract={Digital twin serves as a crucial facilitator in the advancement and implementation of emerging technologies within 5G and beyond networks. However, the intricate structure and diverse functionalities of the existing 5G core network, especially the control plane, present challenges in constructing core network digital twins. In this paper, we propose two novel data-driven architectures for modeling the 5G control plane and implement corresponding deep learning models, namely 5GC-Seq2Seq and 5GC-former, based on the Vanilla Seq2Seq model and Transformer decoder respectively. We also present a solution enabling the interconversion of signaling messages and length-limited vectors to construct a dataset. The experiments are based on 5G core network signaling messages collected by the Spirent C50 network tester, encompassing various procedures such as registration, handover, and PDU sessions. The results show that 5GC-Seq2Seq achieves a 99.997% F1-score (a metric measuring the accuracy of positive samples) in single UE scenarios with a simple structure, but exhibits significantly reduced performance in handling concurrency. In contrast, 5GC-former surpasses 99.999% F1-score while maintaining robust performance under concurrent UE scenarios by constructing a more complex and highly parallel model. These findings validate that our method accurately replicates the principal functionalities of the 5G core network control plane.},

  abstract={Lung cancer, one of the most life-threatening malignancies, has witnessed a significant increase in its incidence and mortality rates over the past few decades. Accurate determination of the histological type of lung cancer is crucial for developing appropriate treatment strategies. However, traditional medical imaging analysis, such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography (CT), faces challenges due to sensor noise, patient variations, and pathological states, which may lead to misinterpretation and errors. In this regard, deep learning approaches can assist in rapidly distinguishing different types of lung cancer by learning complex patterns and features from medical imaging data, aiding clinicians in precise diagnosis. This research aims to address the limitations of existing lung cancer classification models, including suboptimal accuracy, slow inference speed, high computational and storage requirements, and vulnerability to overfitting. To achieve this, we propose an improved lung cancer classification and detection method based on deep learning. Our approach leverages transfer learning by utilizing pre-trained models, data augmentation techniques, and model compression methods, including global unstructured pruning and model distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that the teacher model achieves 100% accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score on the dataset, with a loss of 0.00007575038. The distilled student model, after pruning 55.15% of its parameters, achieves a 52.5% reduction in size. It also attains 100% accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, with an average loss of 0.004158932.},

  abstract={The vehicular metaverse is expected to provide a widely connected virtual Internet of Vehicles (IoV), where extended reality (XR) is one of the critical infrastructures. However, the combination of XR and automated vehicle (AV) networks brings several significant challenges, e.g., low-latency XR panoramic video transmission, high bandwidth, and the high mobility of vehicles. This article introduces digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered panoramic video streaming for XR-assisted connected AVs to reduce transmission latency and intelligently respond to user requirements. Specifically, we propose a DT-enabled distributed XR service management framework to provide low-latency and smooth XR services across different domains in the vehicular metaverse. In addition, we present a case study on XR streaming-based virtualized resource allocation and propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method to minimize transmission latency. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the positive role of AI in connected AV networks can be enhanced by DTs. Finally, open issues and potential research directions for the XR-assisted vehicular metaverse are discussed.},

  pages={114790-114810},
  abstract={In this paper, we address the challenge of limited resources in Internet of Things (IoT) devices by proposing a solution based on digital twin in distributed edge computing networks. Edge computing is a promising approach that moves computing resources closer to the network’s edge to reduce response times in IoT applications. However, simply offloading tasks from IoT devices to edge computing does not accelerate user control. To enhance task performance and improve user management experience, we introduce optimized task scheduling and virtual object management based on a digital twin concept. Our system incorporates virtualization, synchronization, visualization, and simulation functionalities to provide digital twin capabilities. Additionally, we develop a user-friendly web application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for intuitive management of edge computing services. To support our approach, we implement an edge computing supervisor that generates virtualized objects such as edge gateways, IoT devices, and services. These virtual objects serve as resources for creating tasks. Using our proposed digital twin platform, users can dynamically create new tasks based on demand, easily deploy and execute tasks in specific locations, and dynamically allocate edge network resources according to task requirements. An optimized task scheduling mathematical model is presented to compare task scheduling done with and without optimization. Further, the edge computing and digital twin based optimized task scheduling method is integrated with Federated Learning for collaborative learning and privacy preserved computation of sensors sensitive data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by generating tasks for data collection related to indoor environment for prediction of Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) for thermal comfort index of smart homes occupants using HTTP and IoTivity-based devices in distributed edge computing networks. These tasks are properly delivered and executed on the expected edge gateways, showcasing the successful integration of our digital twin platform with edge computing networks. Further, the optimized task scheduling has improved the overall performance of the proposed system, keeping in view latency and processing time.},

  abstract={With the emergence of complex neural network models, the running cost of the models shows an increasing trend, while the larger the model, the exponential increase in training cost. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to compress the model of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by combining data selection and knowledge distillation, so that the performance of the original model can be maintained with low computational cost. (1) For data selection, we propose an algorithm to rank the importance of training data based on influence scores, and select some training data with greater improvement in model performance as the new training data set based on the ranking results. (2) A knowledge distillation method with low data volume is proposed to input some important training data into the teacher model to generate knowledge to guide the training of the student model, so as to reduce the model running cost while maintaining the model performance of the teacher model, and such a method can also availably avoid the overfitting phenomenon when the data volume is too small. By compressing both the data and the model, the training and running costs of the model can be effectively reduced.},
