First is how to choose and quantify the proper features to build user model. Second is how to divide the users into optimal teams to play the best effectiveness of collaborative learning. Based on the collaborative learning theory, its practical research, and the conditions of network learning system, the paper selects learning interest and knowledge level as user's features, using the methods of educational psychology measurement to quantify these two features so as to establish user model. Considering the elements and some practical teaching cases of collaborative learning, the paper derives the requirements of collaborative learning's basic unit: the collaboration group, and defines three features of collaborative group as: the cohesion within group, the hierarchy within group and the uniformity among groups. Then, the paper builds the group model and put forward the objective function of collaborative learning grouping scheme. Finally, from the perspective of clustering and combinatorial optimization, the paper investigates how to divide the users into collaborative learning's groups. As a result, it comes up the method as follows. Above all, according to the users' learning interest, it uses K-means to cluster the users into different clusters. Then in each cluster, genetic algorithm is adopted for collaborative learning's group division according to the users' knowledge level. Thus, the paper achieves the automatic group division to find the approximate optimal collaboration learning groups. Lastly, through the simulation experiments, the validity of the method is proved.","1948-9447","978-1-4799-3708-0","10.1109/CCDC.2014.6852443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6852443","user model;collaborative learning;group model;automatic grouping","Collaborative work;Genetic algorithms;Linear programming;Vectors;Psychology;Collaboration;Learning systems","","5","","12","IEEE","14 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The modeling of K.E.M.C.s is performed through a combination of different student modeling techniques: overlay, stereotypes, fuzzy logic and OCC cognitive theory. The gain of this approach is that the particular student model represents a sufficiently large part of the complex dimensions of a real student of programming.

The design relies on a social collaborative learning pattern, open group-sourcing, based on peer production and feedback. To match peers' interactions with learners' skills, we align the visitor/resident learner model with the weighted peer production model.

This system utilizes multiple advanced computational approaches including the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrologic model for watershed simulations, interactive genetic algorithms and reinforcement-based machine learning algorithms for search and optimization, and deep learning artificial neural networks for user modeling, within an encompassing human-computer interaction framework. A substantial user study of the WRESTORE system was conducted recently involving multiple real stakeholders varying from consultants, government officials, watershed alliance members, etc., with the objective of gaining insight about WRESTORE'S usability and utility. In particular focus was the user modeling component that develops a computational model of a user's preferences and criteria, based on real-time user-provided ratings for a subset of possible designs (similar to the idea of user profiling commonly done for human-computer interaction systems).

One of the main functions of an ITS system is to present its students with course materials that are most appropriate to their current knowledge of domain concepts, example being one of the course materials. ITS systems typically compare and analyze student model (SM) components for student's current knowledge of concepts (main topics, e.g. Scanf in C programming) that are required to understand the next example (e.g. Codes for scanf) suitable for learning a task (e.g. Write C code to read 2 integers from the keyboard). Existing systems such as NavEx and PADS perform an exhaustive matching of student knowledge level with all examples in the database. This research proposes a task-based technique for managing and classifying examples for more effective retrieval of relevant examples for learning a task. We propose a system called EASK for translating task and example solutions into concepts for similarity matching, which is more readily available, easily extendible and adaptable to other domains. Examples and tasks are represented as vectors of weights computed with term frequency measure TFIDF that signify the importance of a concept for an example. Examples most similar to a task are found by using a classification method called k-NN, which finds the closeness between different objects such as examples and tasks using cosine similarity measure and selecting the k objects (examples) with highest similarity scores. As a by-product, k-NN also predicts the class label (difficulty level) of the task. Our proposed model achieves this prediction with 89% accuracy.","","978-1-4799-6239-6","10.1109/CIT.2014.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984744","adaptation;data mining;classification;example-based Learning;student model","Vectors;Computational modeling;Materials;Indexes;Analytical models;Adaptation models","","1","","8","IEEE","15 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, Bijective soft set algorithm is used in classifying students learning style based on Felder Silverman learning style model. The discernible matrix parameter reduction was used to generate attributes reducts, whereby rules were generated from these reducts. Experiments were carried out using simulated data with various attributes that represent student's characteristics according to the four dimensions of Felder Silverman model. The experiments revealed that Bijective soft set gives high classification accuracy with suitable number of rules.

In this paper, we focus on adaptive digital resource modelling to assist users in the consolidated management of digital resources in an interactive and adaptive system. In this paper we propose an approach of digital resources modelling which will make the use of digital resources more adaptive. We introduce an adaptive resource model which includes LOM (Learning Object Metadata) metadata, manipulation rules and operators. This model allows an automatic adaptation to user's profiles and user's contexts. An experimental implementation called PRISE (Personal Interactive research Smart Environment) is carried out in our laboratory. PRISE is an interactive and adaptive system to assist researchers in using and managing their digital resources efficiently.

In the model, the first stage of the pre-test-practice post-test evaluation protocol is used to initialize the student model needed for adaptation. In order to keep assessment congruent with learning, the same type of activity is used in all three stages of evaluation, and the software tutor itself is used to administer all three stages of the protocol. In order to minimize time while maximizing learning, post-test is set to adapt to practice, and students are also provided feedback after pre-test activities on which they provide incorrect response. Finally, the software tutor is set up to administer the pre-test-practice-post-test protocol as one seamless integrated session with no discernible breaks between the stages. This model of deployment helps the developer evaluate the effectiveness of the software tutor, helps the student minimize time while maximizing learning and enables the instructor to obtain concept-level summary of what worked and what needs to be reviewed again in the classroom. The deployment model has been implemented in software tutors for programming, called problets (problets.org). We produce quantitative data from three problets used in spring 2013 to illustrate the benefits of the deployment model that accrue to developers, students and instructors.","","978-1-4799-6489-5","10.1109/T4E.2014.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009526","Software tutors;Evaluation;Adaptation;Deployment","Software;Adaptation models;Protocols;Springs;Programming;Debugging;Computational modeling","","6","","15","IEEE","15 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, everyone can study at anywhere and anytime so that they can improve and update their knowledge in lifelong time. Adaptive learning is a research branch of e-learning, which give adaptation and personalization to users in learning context. Different people receive different learning materials / teaching methods in accordance with their individual information / characteristics such as knowledge, goal, experience, interest, background, etc. Such individual information is structured in a format so-called user model. User model is the heart of adaptive learning system. User model is managed by user modeling system. There are many theories and practical methods to build up user model and adaptive learning system and each method has particular aspects but it is very difficult to determine which method or system is good because there is no evaluation standard and each method has particular strong point and drawbacks. Therefore, the goal of this research is to propose criterions to evaluate adaptive learning system and user modeling system.

We hypothesize that all domain concepts visited in resources from the digital libraries can be considered as knowledge poorly or badly acquired by learners and merit thus more attention and consideration both by the tutor for the didactic monitoring of learners on these concepts and from author of course, to restructure and more enrich the educational content which articulate these concepts identified beforehand in this analysis.","","978-1-4799-7508-2","10.1109/ISKO-Maghreb.2014.7033449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033449","e-Learning;Digital library;domain ontology;conceptual indexing;learner model","Libraries;Ontologies;Electronic learning;Semantics;Indexing;Vectors;Context","","1","","39","IEEE","9 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, access to information requires the use of web tools for information retrieval (IR). Many methods from traditional IR were extended to structured documents. On the other hand, approaches have been proposed to regard specifically semantics in structured documents by using external semantic resources while collecting original documents on which it is necessary to provide semantic similarity measures in order to perform comparisons between concepts. Most previous approaches did not take into account the relations between concepts and are not tailored to the specific needs of learners. In this paper a semantic IR system of structured educational documents is proposed and adapted to the needs and preferences of the learner. This approach is based on a representation of the nodes of the document's tree and of the query through the semantic vectors of those concepts.

It is known that grammar error detection and feedback are challenging problems in written language, however, they become much more difficult tasks in oral conversation because it is difficult for a system to judge whether an error is due to grammar or automatic speech recognition (ASR). False alarms occur when a learner correctly utters a remark, but the system gives feedback implying an error. Minimizing the false alarm rate is especially critical in education applications because it is imperative that the tutor give correct instruction to learners. Thus, to reduce the false alarm rate in grammar error detection and feedback, we apply a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) when the system provides feedback about a learner's mistake. The POMDP models uncertainty between grammar errors and ASR errors. An additional advantage of our method is that “belief states” in POMDP can be used for learner models which indicate each individual learner's grammar comprehension level.","","978-1-4799-7129-9","10.1109/SLT.2014.7078588","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7078588","Dialog based computer assisted language learning;grammar error correction;learner model;POMDP;dialog system","Grammar;Error correction;Computational modeling;Natural languages;Speech;Uncertainty;Computers","","1","","16","IEEE","2 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach is fully implemented and evaluated in an educational application module, called fuzzy knowledge state definer (FuzKSD). In particular, FuzKSD performs user modeling by dynamically identifying and updating a student's knowledge level of all the concepts of the domain knowledge. The operation of FuzKSD is based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) that are used to represent the dependences among the domain concepts. FuzKSD uses fuzzy sets to represent a student's knowledge level as a subset of the domain knowledge. Thus, it combines fuzzy theory with the overlay model. Moreover, it employs a novel inference mechanism that dynamically updates user stereotypes using fuzzy sets. It should be noted that the overlay model and stereotypes constitute two widely used methods for user modeling. However, they have not been combined with fuzzy sets thus far in the literature. The gain from this novel combination is significant as a student level of knowledge is represented in a more realistic way by automatically modeling the learning or forgetting process of a student with respect to the FCMs and thus the system can provide individualized adaptive advice. The application of this approach is not limited to adaptive instruction. It can also be used in other systems with changeable user states, such as e-shops, where consumers' preferences change over time and affect one another. Therefore, the particular module constitutes a novel generic fuzzy tool, which offers dynamic adaptation to users' needs and preferences of adaptive systems.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2310242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6763091","Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs);fuzzy sets;student model;personalization;programming","Adaptation models;Fuzzy logic;Adaptive systems;Fuzzy sets;Materials;Electronic learning;Computer languages","","55","","52","IEEE","11 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) Student Model is a time-tested method that maintains information about students' knowledge levels for the different skills in the topic domain. In our previous work, we had proposed the Personalized, Clustered, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (PC-BKT) model that individualizes the learning of skills for each student and additionally improves the prediction for the cold start problem. A clustering of both students and skills based on a student and skill capability matrix was used to learn the prior skills to deal with the cold start problem, which is the prediction for either new skills or new students. Both the BKT and the PC-BKT models assume that a skill once learnt is never forgotten. But forgetting is pervasive. If a previously learnt skill is not used for a while, there is a higher chance of forgetting it. One of the factors that influence the forgetting is the time duration before the current attempt at using a skill and the previous attempt. We incorporate forgetting as a time decay function in the BKT and PC-BKT models and show significant increase in the accuracy of the student prediction.","","978-1-4799-7171-8","10.1109/CCIP.2015.7100688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7100688","Bayesian Knowledge Tracing;BKT;PC-BKT;Student Models;User Models;Intelligent Tutoring Systems;ITS","Adaptation models;Predictive models;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Bayes methods;Algebra","","12","","19","IEEE","4 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, recent studies have shown that this is not the case for several biometric modalities. Adaptive biometric systems deal with this issue by adapting the user model over time. Some algorithms for adaptive biometrics have been investigated and compared in the literature. In machine learning, several studies show that the combination of individual techniques in ensembles may lead to more accurate and stable decision models.

The design of effective strategies able to face this problem is however particularly challenging, due to several factors, such as the heterogeneity and the non-stationary distribution of the data stream, as well as the presence of an imbalanced class distribution. To complicate the problem, there is the scarcity of public datasets for confidentiality issues, which does not allow researchers to verify the new strategies in many data contexts. Differently from the canonical state-of-the-art strategies, instead of defining a unique model based on the past transactions of the users, we follow a Divide and Conquer strategy, by defining multiple models (user behavioral patterns), which we exploit to evaluate a new transaction, in order to detect potential attempts of fraud. We can act on some parameters of this process, in order to adapt the models sensitivity to the operating environment. Considering that our models do not need to be trained with both the past legitimate and fraudulent transactions of a user, since they use only the legitimate ones, we can operate in a proactive manner, by detecting fraudulent transactions that have never occurred in the past. Such a way to proceed also overcomes the data imbalance problem that afflicts the machine learning approaches. The evaluation of the proposed approach is performed by comparing it with one of the most performant approaches at the state of the art as Random Forests, using a real-world credit card dataset.","","978-9-8975-8164-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7526961","Fraud Detection;Pattern Recognition;User Model","Biological system modeling;Data models;Credit cards;Face;Context;Economics;Sensitivity","","","","15","","1 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It also demonstrates the advantages of visualizing both learners' performance and their contribution to a learning community.

This is due to the flexibility of LMS to deliver the learning materials in various ways and approaches. However, the heterogeneous of students' behavior, the diversity of learning materials and the complexity of hyperlink for navigation are the main factors of limitation in LMS and can caused cognitive overload among students. Many literatures show that, providing an e-learning system that considers student preferences and needs can improve student performances and understanding. Therefore, this research proposed a new framework to enhance LMS to support adaptive features. The proposed enhancement of LMS is implemented in Moodle platform which includes major adaptation features based on visual and verbal dimension of Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM) and the student's knowledge level. The enhanced framework is organized into three models; domain model, student model and adaptive model that need to interact together to perform adaptively in presenting the learning materials. Three multi-agent components have been added to the Moodle platform to implement the adaptation. The current Moodle repository has also been modified by creating additional fields that are necessary for adaptation.","","978-1-5090-1125-4","10.1109/ICT-ISPC.2016.7519230","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7519230","adaptive;leraning management system;Moodle;learning style;knowledge level;agent","Navigation;Adaptation models;Education","","2","","16","IEEE","25 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have considered the dataset from the Global Internet User Survey for 10789 respondents to perform a security-oriented statistical analysis of correlated user behavior. We constructed logistic regression models to analyze the statistical predictability of susceptible and not-so-susceptible identity theft victims based on their behavior and knowledge of security and privacy practices.

To help people live better in the highly developed information society, the so-called cyber-individual (Cyber-I), which is far beyond a user model or a software agent to assist a user, has been proposed to provide the most comprehensive digital entities for its corresponding Real-I in terms of the individual's experience, behavior, and thinking as well as his or her birth, growth, and death. In this study, we concentrate on the personal data analytics to facilitate the cyber individual modeling. Organic Stream is introduced to systematically organize and refine the personal stream data, which can help improve the data processing and management in the CI-Spine tier and CI-Pivot tier of Cyber-I. The DSUN (Dynamically Socialized User Networking) model is employed to better utilize the collective intelligence from a group of users, which can help improve the CI-Mind tier to make Cyber-I to become more robust. Based on these, we discuss the functional modules for the facilitation of cyber individual modeling.

Each educational activity is specified through the deployed content, the skills required to tackle it, and those acquired, and is further annotated by the effort estimated for the task. The latter may change from one student to another, given the already achieved competence. A suitable weighting of the robustness (certainty) of student's skills, stored in SK, and their combination are used to verify the inclusion of a learning activity in the student's ZPD. With respect to our previous work, the algorithm for the calculation of the ZPD of the individual student has been optimized, by enhancing the certainty weighting policy, and a graphical display of the ZPD has been added. Thanks to the latter, the student can get a clear vision of the learning paths that he/she can presently tackle.

As for the domain model, it is designed according to the recommendations of the differentiated pedagogy, which advocates creating multiple versions of the same learning object. Finally in order to ensure the adaptation inside the system, a Bayesian network, to match the designed learning object with the specifics of the learner profile was developed. It is also necessary to emphasize, that the major feature of the system is, its ability to correct the generated learning path in case of a failure in the evaluation phase. The learning path relevance is questioned, based on a recommendation system which enables updating the initial profile, or recommending the most relevant versions of the learning object, in case where the similarity calculation in behavior, reveals that the observed behavior in the system does not fit the initial profile description.","2327-1884","978-1-5090-0751-6","10.1109/CIST.2016.7805098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7805098","","Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Learning systems;Bayes methods;Electronic mail;Electronic learning;Erbium","","6","","13","IEEE","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It extracts features through machine learning techniques, which are then used to comprehend the user's gameplay, by utilising the educational theoretical frameworks of the Concept of Flow and Zone of Proximal Development. The end result is to provide at a next stage a new track that fits to the user needs, which aids both the training of the driver and their engagement in the game. In order to validate that the system is designing personalised tracks, we associated the average performance from 41 users that played the game, with the difficulty factor of the generated track.

"Creating Bridges: The Role of Exploratory Design Research in an Intelligent Tutoring System Project","D. Gooch; L. Benton; R. Khaled; D. Lukeš; A. Vasalou",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"Interacting with Computers","18 Jan 2018","2016","28","3","372","386","Designers of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) have long been interested in delivering personalized teaching to individual students, typically by ensuring that the student receives content appropriate to their skills and knowledge. Nonetheless, a more holistic view on what constitutes good teaching practice has challenged whether this approach to user modelling is sufficient. Teaching is not only defined by what is taught, but also by how it is taught. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploratory design research can support this view by generating a more inclusive set of user attributes for purposes of user modelling. Through a case study, we show that design research for user modelling can function as a boundary object serving three important roles that underpin more specifically the design of user modelling and more broadly ITS design. First, design research can establish common ground by encapsulating domain knowledge in an accessible form. This can support diverse project stakeholders to make decisions on what is to be modelled. Secondly, design research can reveal a wide range of teaching and learning perspectives that in turn introduce transparency to the decision-making process of user modelling and provoke a sense of criticality and accountability amongst project stakeholders. Thirdly, design research can build new bridges between the design of the technology and the user model that underpins it. To this end, user attributes deemed important, yet too complex or cumbersome to develop, can become design principles in the context of the overall ITS design. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS We highlight how the creation of user models rarely incorporates assistance from the HCI community. We present a series of design activities intended to assist in the creation of a User Model. We examine how this design-oriented methodology creates a boundary object. We discuss the three benefits this boundary object brings to constructing user models, namely establishing common ground, creating transparency when considering possible alternatives and creating a springboard for new activities.","1873-7951","","10.1093/iwc/iwv009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8178063","human computer interaction (HCI);HCI design and evaluation methods;user models;user centered design;interactive learning environments;boundary objects","","","3","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

PADA is a web-based tool designed to facilitate the creation of descriptive visualizations required for a better understanding by students about their learner model. Through information visualization techniques, PADA shows students the knowledge in their learner models in order to help them to increase their awareness and to support reflection and self-regulation about their difficulties in reading. PADA provides different learning analytics on reading performance of students, so that they can self-identify their strengths and weaknesses and self-regulate their learning. This paper describes examples that cover a variety of visualizations (bar-charts, line-charts, and pie-charts) to show user model fragments as personal details, reading profiles, learning styles, and cognitive traits of the students. We tested PADA with 26 students (aged 21-53 years) of different academic programs and levels, dyslexic and non-dyslexic. The results show that PADA can assist students in creating awareness, and help them to understand their difficulties associated with the reading tasks, as well as facilitate reflection and self-regulation in the learning process.

It mainly offers adaptive navigation and presentation based on a wide range of characteristics, preferences and understanding of learners. The adaptation is enabled by a user model which records users' characteristics, domain models which represent all concepts taught in a course and relationships among them, and goal and adaptation models that infer domain and user models to produce adaptation. The main adaptation offered in AEH deals with where a learner can go next. However, it does not inform learners how far they are from the goals. This paper addresses the problem of finding the shortest path to reach a learning goal. We propose a modified Dijkstra algorithm applied to a graph-based domain model. It takes account of learners' knowledge, the weight of topics in a course and the influence scores of each topic to learn the other topics to predict the possibility of success in learning a topic. Based on the success possibility scores, learning paths are recommended to students. Since students' knowledge is progressive, the success possibility scores are dynamics and they will result in a dynamic learning path adaptive to students' progress.","2165-9567","978-1-5090-5467-1","10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7942875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7942875","domain model;user model;adaptive learning path;graph;weights;influence scores;learners' knowledge;Dijkstra","Adaptation models;Tools;Navigation;Computational modeling;Data models;Adaptive systems;Engineering education","","5","","22","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problems are defined by the teacher, also specifying instructional aspects, such as the learner's skills involved in producing a solution. For each individual learner a personal Student Model is maintained, recording learner's knowledge and skills, as shown by the solved problems. The access to the problem is guarded by the system, ensuring that the problems can all be “seen” by any student, whereas a learner can work on a problem only if its prerequisites are covered, or anyway “not too far” from her current competences. The available automata are modular structures of various origin (a robotic arm connected to an Arduino platform, and some Lego MindStorm builds, in various configurations). Such hardware is reasonably sophisticated in terms of functions, enjoys a wide provision of sensors and actuators, so allowing for presenting the learners with a good deal of problems, and is sufficiently affordable in terms of cost. Making the learner choose and sequence the problems to undertake, with the only limitation of the problem affordability measured by the student model, allows learners to follow a highly personalizable learning path in a pedagogically controlled setting, which we submit is conducive to better engagement and learning results.","","978-1-5090-4862-5","10.1109/CarpathianCC.2017.7970464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7970464","Virtual Laboratory;e-learning;Adaptivity;Robot Control;Teleoperation","Remote laboratories;Electronic learning;Hardware;Software;Computer architecture;Manipulators","","8","","26","IEEE","7 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A universal model, for this purpose, that supports dynamic analysis and mining of user-generated content (or contexts) is designed in this paper. Two major factors, sensing and analysis of crowd preference and their decision-making behavior, are especially targeted. This model formulates the given scenario that comprehensively illustrates the possible actors and correlated actions among them with a set of rules to enhance the machine learning results. This model outlines a detail process on pre-/post-process of the data, and indicates the core techniques for user modeling. The raw data collected from on-service website, i.e., Airbnb, are utilized for the preliminary examination of our proposal. We especially look at internal factors (e.g., nationality, gender, and age) and external factors (e.g., device, social media, and time) that reflect implicitly the difference on crowd's preference and behavior.

"Predicting Student Performance in an ITS Using Task-Driven Features","R. Chaturvedi; C. I.

The ability to predict student performance enables an ITS to make informed decisions towards meeting the individual needs of students. It is also useful for ITS designers to validate if students are actually able to succeed in learning the subject. Predicting student performance is a function of two complex and dynamic factors: (f1) student learning behavior and (f2) their current knowledge in the subject. Learning behavior is captured from student interaction with the ITS (e.g. time spent on an assigned task) and is stored in the form of web logs. Student knowledge in the subject is represented by the marks they score in assigned tasks and is stored in a specific component of the ITS called student model. In order to build an accurate prediction model, this raw data from student model and web logs must be engineered carefully and transformed into meaningful features. Existing systems such as LON-CAPA predict students performance using their learning behavior alone, without considering their (current) knowledge on the subject. Lack of proper feature engineering is evident from the low values of accuracy of their prediction models. This research proposes a highly accurate model that predicts student success in assigned tasks with a 96% accuracy by using features that are better informed not only about students in terms of the two factors f1 and f2 mentioned above, but also on the assigned task itself (e.g. task's difficulty level). In order to accomplish this, an Example Recommendation System (ERS) is designed with a fine-grained student model (to represent student data) and a fine-grained domain model (to represent domain resources such as tasks).","","978-1-5386-0958-3","10.1109/CIT.2017.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8031470","ITS;Student model;Domain model;performance;task-driven;feature engineering;predictive mining","Feature extraction;Predictive models;Erbium;Data mining;Data models;Decision trees;Computational modeling","","6","","20","IEEE","14 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the student works step-by-step through their problem solving process the system engages in a process called model tracing. Anytime the student model deviates from the domain model the system identifies, or flags, that an error has occurred. This helps in the shorter feedback cycle for the student and help them in overcoming these shortcomings through the recommendation engine. The tutor model accepts information from the domain and student models and makes choices about tutoring strategies and actions. At any point in the problem-solving process the learner may request guidance on what to do next, relative to their current location in the model. Knowledge tracing tracks the learner's progress from problem to problem and builds a profile of strengths and weaknesses relative to the production rules. The tutor system gives a visual graph of the learner's success in each of the monitored skills related to solving problems. When a learner requests a hint, or an error is flagged, the know ledge tracing data and the skill meter are updated in real-time. The Another core feature of the tutor system is its recommendation engine which on the basis of the skill meter that is updated at the real time will find what all are the things that the student may be interested on and suggest him the path that could be more fruitful.

In Knowledge distillation framework, some privilege information in addition to featurelabels pairs available only during training, is exploited to help the model learn better without using such previleged information during testing [1]; knowledge from one model can be distilled to another and thereby guiding it in learning better [2]. In this work, a DNN acoustic model trained using data pooled from Dysarthric speech data and parallel un-impaired data is used as the intelligent teacher while the student DNN model is trained using only Dysarthric speech. The target label for training the student model is a combination of hard aligned labels and those obtained from forward-pass through the teacher model.

For learners engaged in self-study online distance learning, this may result in material being presented at either too high or too low cognitive levels. According to the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory, this may result in either frustration or boredom among learners. This paper proposes a recommender-system-based adaptive e-learning framework for personalised teaching on e-learning platforms. The framework would assist designers, teachers and learners to identify issues they need to consider in order to address challenges of poor engagement in online distance settings, arising from a “one-size-fits-all” approach that does not recognise the role of individual differences in teaching and learning. Secondly, the framework may enable the identification of problems or obstacles that may be encountered when supporting learners in their quest to reduce frustration and boredom when using a Recommender-Based Pedagogical System (RBPS). A literature review was conducted on adaptive e-learning systems based on the ZPD theory, learner modelling, the Generic Adaptive Framework and a recommendation system model. 70 articles were selected from a database of 720 articles published between 2010 and 2017 to come up with the dimensions needed to develop such a model for the framework through deductive analysis. The research found out that the majority of the studies only consider three dimensions to an adaptive framework, that is, the learner model, the content model and the adaptation engine while the Generic Adaptation Framework proposes seven dimensions. In addition, the majority of the studies are based on the principles of macro-adaptation which provide a “static” snapshot of a learner's profile instead of dynamically adjusting the adaptation as learner variables. In the proposed adaptive framework, we identified five dimensions, including real-time dynamic adaptation and context modelling in addition to the learner model, the domain model and the pedagogical strategy.","","978-1-5386-3837-8","10.23919/ISTAFRICA.2017.8102297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8102297","Adaptive framework;educational recommender system;zone of proximal development;generic adaptation framework","Adaptive systems;Adaptation models;Electronic learning;Learning management systems;Real-time systems","","17","","28","","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So, the approach adopted in this paper is based on a framework called ArCARE (Conceptual Framework of Educational Resources Adaptation in Virtual Learning Environments), which allows adaptation of resources for students in VLEs, allowing the construction of their knowledge, using multi-agent system technology that handles an open learner model ontology.

While deep-learning models have provided a major breakthrough in highly-dimensional problems such as image processing, it is difficult to say today which is the best model to address the analysis of large volumes of highly-dimensional data collected in operational networks. In this paper we present a potential solution to fill this gap, exploring the application of ensemble learning models to multiple network measurement problems. We introduce GML Learning, a generic Machine Learning model for the analysis of network measurements. The GML model is a generalization of the well-known stacking approach to ensemble learning, and follows the concepts of the Super Learner model. The Super Learner performs asymptotically as well as the best input base or weak learners, providing a very powerful approach to tackle multiple problems with the same technique. In addition, it defines an approach to minimize over-fitting likelihood during training, using a variant of cross-validation. We deploy the GML model on top of Big-DAMA, a big data analytics framework for network measurement applications. We test the proposed solution in five different and assorted network measurement problems, including detection of network attacks and anomalies, QoE modeling and prediction, and Internet-paths dynamics tracking. Results confirm that the GML model provides better results than any of the single baseline models of the stack, and outperforms traditional bagging and boosting ensemble learning approaches. The GML Learning model opens the door for a generalization of a best-practice technique for the analysis of network measurements.","2165-963X","978-3-901882-98-2","10.23919/CNSM.2017.8255998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8255998","Big-Data;Network Traffic Monitoring and Analysis;Machine Learning;Ensemble Learning;Super Learning;Network Measurements","Analytical models;Data models;Big Data;Predictive models;Bagging;Monitoring;Prediction algorithms","","16","","44","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The security challenges that need to be overcome mainly stem from the open nature of a wireless medium, such as a Wi-Fi network. An impersonation attack is an attack in which an adversary is disguised as a legitimate party in a system or communications protocol. The connected devices are pervasive, generating high-dimensional data on a large scale, which complicates simultaneous detections. Feature learning, however, can circumvent the potential problems that could be caused by the large-volume nature of network data. This paper thus proposes a novel deep-feature extraction and selection (D-FES), which combines stacked feature extraction and weighted feature selection. The stacked autoencoding is capable of providing representations that are more meaningful by reconstructing the relevant information from its raw inputs. We then combine this with modified weighted feature selection inspired by an existing shallow-structured machine learner. We finally demonstrate the ability of the condensed set of features to reduce the bias of a machine learner model as well as the computational complexity. Our experimental results on a well-referenced Wi-Fi network benchmark data set, namely, the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion data set, prove the usefulness and the utility of the proposed D-FES by achieving a detection accuracy of 99.918% and a false alarm rate of 0.012%, which is the most accurate detection of impersonation attacks reported in the literature.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2017.2762828","Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion through the Korea Government (MSIT) (Research on Communication Technology using Bio-Inspired Algorithm and 2017-0-00555, Towards Provable-secure Multi-party Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol based on Lattices in a Quantum World)(grant numbers:2013-0-00396); National Research Foundation of Korea through the Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:NRF-2015R1A-2A2A01006812); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067440","Intrusion detection system;impersonation attack;deep learning;feature extraction;stacked autoencoder;large-scale Wi-Fi networks","Feature extraction;Wireless fidelity;Support vector machines;Wireless networks;Computational modeling;Security;Machine learning","","145","","71","IEEE","13 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the context of lifelong learning, the learner model is a user learning pattern, which can be modelled all the time based on user interaction with various sources. The main issue in lifelong learner model design is what type of information needs to be stored in the learner model and how the information granularity is involved. The type and level of information granularity of a user will determine how appropriate the pedagogical policies are to be provided by the system for a user. Lifelong learner model design should be in line with the principles of lifelong learning, namely sociality, interoperability, and scrutability. This paper discusses our research on learner model ontology for lifelong learning. The goal expected to be achieved is that there is a lifelong learner model ontology to be accessed and updated by adaptive learning systems. This research classifies learners' attributes into two groups, which are static and dynamic attributes. Static attributes tend not to change or very rarely change. They include learner's profile, special needs, aptitude, preference, learning approach, learning style, personality, and cognitive capability. On the other hand, dynamic attributes include learning history and study plan.

Therefore, this paper focuses on MPT on real roads using a moving camera. Although convolutional neural network (CNN)-based single object tracking methods have recently been proposed, the online learning of CNN for MPT is a significant burden in terms of real-time processing. However, because the features extracted from CNN are a good representation and achieve a high generalization capability, to reduce the learning time, a shallow pre-trained CNN was applied in the present study as a feature extractor instead of an object tracker As an online tracker, this study uses random ferns (RF) with pre-trained CNN output feature, which can make the problem computationally tractable and robustness. However, a large RF requires significant amount of memory and computational complexity, and is still a burden in terms of online learning in cases of multi-pedestrian tracking. Therefore, we introduce a teacher-student model compression algorithm for selecting a few optimal ferns for each tracker, thereby, reducing the online learning time. The online learning of a student-RF tracker has an advantage in that it can adaptively update the tracker to achieve robustness against various changes, such as in pose and illumination, and partial occlusions within a limited period of time. The proposed algorithm was successfully applied to benchmark video sequences captured from a moving camera that include multiple pedestrians in various poses. Specifically, the proposed algorithm yields a more accurate tracking performance than the other state-of-the-art methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2867621","National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education(grant numbers:2016R1D1A1A09916581); Future Vehicle Leading Technology Development Project; Daegu City(grant numbers:DG-2017-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8449934","Convolutional neural networks;multiple pedestrian tracking;online learning tracker;random ferns;teacher–student model compression","Cameras;Target tracking;Feature extraction;Roads;Real-time systems;Trajectory","","18","","49","OAPA","29 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Whereas most previous studies of TS training used a frame-level distance between teacher and student models' distributions, we propose using the sequence-level temper-atured Kullback-Leibler divergence as a metric for TS training. In our experiment on the AMI meeting corpus, we prepared a strong teacher model consisting of a convolutional neural network, time delay neural network, and long short-term memory, which had 47.7M parameters and achieved a state-of-the-art word error rate (WER) of 18.05%. Whereas the small student AM (10.8M params. and 19.72% WER) trained by a frame-level TS training was able to fill only 43% of the WER gap between teacher and student AMs, the student AM trained by the proposed method achieved a 18.23% WER, filling 89% of the WER gap from the teacher AM. We also show that the frame-level TS training sometimes even degrades the performance of the student model whereas the proposed method consistently improved the accuracy.","2379-190X","978-1-5386-4658-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462619","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8462619","Deep learning;acoustic model;distillation;lattice-free MMI","Training;Hidden Markov models;Acoustics;Decoding;Neural networks;Lattices;Mutual information","","4","","27","IEEE","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It learns to handle the speaker and environment variability inherent in and restricted to the speech signal in the target domain without proactively addressing the robustness to other likely conditions. Performance degradation may thus ensue. In this work, we advance T/S learning by proposing adversarial T/S learning to explicitly achieve condition-robust unsupervised domain adaptation. In this method, a student acoustic model and a condition classifier are jointly optimized to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the output distributions of the teacher and student models, and simultaneously, to min-maximize the condition classification loss. A condition-invariant deep feature is learned in the adapted student model through this procedure. We further propose multi-factorial adversarial T/S learning which suppresses condition variabilities caused by multiple factors simultaneously. Evaluated with the noisy CHiME-3 test set, the proposed methods achieve relative word error rate improvements of 44.60% and 5.38%, respectively, over a clean source model and a strong T/S learning baseline model.","2379-190X","978-1-5386-4658-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8461682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8461682","teacher-student learning;adversarial training;domain adaptation;parallel unlabeled data","Adaptation models;Data models;Acoustics;Noise measurement;Feature extraction;Training;Robustness","","43","","34","IEEE","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the development of personal computers, the usage of the user model has been evolving in the past 40 years. In the early age of the computer, as a part of computer application, one user model could only be used for a single domain, such as the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the education support. With the increase of many different applications, a user model was separated from its specific computer application to support the cross-domain usage for multiple applications. The emergence of the Internet made the user model to be the users' specific representation on a single social platform for the identification by other users. In the foreseeable future, the user model will become a common representation for its user via multiple social platforms. Theoretically, a unique, digital, comprehensive description of every human individual, namely Cyber Individual (Cyber-I) may exist on the Internet. In this paper, we first focus on approaches to build up the Cyber-I model in comparison to the user model, in terms of model representations, architectures of modeling system and modeling techniques.

The control policy utilizes explicit user feedback to optimize a reward measure reflecting user comfort and addresses the explorationexploitation trade-off in a multi-armed bandit framework. The proposed approach combines restless bandits and upper confidence bound algorithms.

Thus, in practice, we need to perform region of interest selection in low magnification objectives to choose only the best candidate regions for the later high magnification analysis. With the fast development of computer vision and deep learning, it is possible to train an accurate convolutional neural network (CNN) based classifier to do this region selection task which would normally be done by experienced scientists and pathologists. However, data collection and labelling during the training stage are very time-consuming, labour intensive and expensive tasks. Researchers starting to ask a much more challenging question: how can we use unlabeled data to boost the system performance? In this paper, to answer this question and to reduce labelling effort, we propose a data distillation training framework to train a CNN classifier on limited labeled data with the help of unlabeled data. The unlabeled data will be carefully selected by a teacher model via a data distillation process and put into the training set for a student model.

The multimedia, like video, animations, audio and interactive content, that the digital games use, make them more impressive, almost magical. They cause enthusiasm and pleasant feelings to users-players. Therefore, they can be used to motivate students to participate in learning processes. That is the reason why educational digital games has become a burning issue. However, some users-players deal with difficulties during the game playing. For example, they may have difficulties in solving a puzzle, crossing a labyrinth, finding a hidden object, or defeating in a battle etc. As a result, they are disappointed and are drawn away from the game's educational goal. Therefore, in the presented paper, a stereotype-based user model, which identifies the abilities and difficulties that a particular user-player has during the game playing, is presented. A user model is able to highlight the user's individual needs and specific characteristics in order to offer personalization. The presented user model provides the game the ability to be adapted to each particular player's needs and abilities, making the playing process more fascinating and allowing the player to focus on the learning process and the educational goal. Furthermore, the paper presents examples of operation. Also, the system has been evaluated and the evaluation results are very encouraging.","","978-1-5386-8161-9","10.1109/IISA.2018.8633655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8633655","educational game;user model;adaptation;stereotypes","Games;Logic gates;Adaptation models;Navigation;Solid modeling;Business;Informatics","","4","","16","IEEE","3 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the scientific literature, it seems to be of particular interest to provide educational applications and systems with “intelligence”, in order to be able to adapt either the learning material or the tutoring and learning processes to each individual student's needs. The module of student model is crucial for offering a personalized learning experience to each particular student. Student modeling has been introduced in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), but it's use has been extended to most current educational software applications that aim to be adaptive and personalized. Student modeling is able to highlight students individual needs, learning characteristics, knowledge level, errors or misconceptions etc. However, building a student model is a complex process. In this paper, a novel web service API, which creates platform-independent and technological-independent student models using the technology of web services, is presented. The presented API is called FSP Creator. Its innovative operation relies on the facts that the created student profile i) can be embedded in any educational application (web, mobile, game), regardless of the system's technological characteristics or programming language, ii) can be recognized by all the different applications that use it and call the same web services. Furthermore, the created student profile is based on fuzzy logic sets that are used by a Fuzzy Rule System incorporated in FSP Creator and used for selecting the appropriate learning material and exercises. However, each application that uses the created student profile can extend the fuzzy rule set or use its own fuzzy rule set as desired. For the description of the operations of FSP Creator, we have used three different educational applications (two games and one web-based educational application) that have used the fuzzy student profile, which has been created by the presented API.","","978-1-5386-8161-9","10.1109/IISA.2018.8633662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8633662","intelligent tutoring systems;fuzzy logic;web services;student modeling","Web services;Adaptation models;Games;Fuzzy logic;Education;Fuzzy sets;Adaptive systems","","2","","17","IEEE","3 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Past strategies to address this challenge have considered model adaptation, accent classification with a model selection, alternate pronunciation lexicon, etc. In this study, we consider a recurrent neural network (RNN) with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) cost function trained on multi-accent English data including US (Native), Indian and Hispanic accents. We exploit dark knowledge from a model trained with the multi-accent data to train student models under the guidance of both a teacher model and CTC cost of target transcription. We show that transferring knowledge from a single RNN-CTC trained model toward a student model, yields better performance than the stand-alone teacher model. Since the outputs of different trained CTC models are not necessarily aligned, it is not possible to simply use an ensemble of CTC teacher models. To address this problem, we train accent specific models under the guidance of a single multi-accent teacher, which results in having multiple aligned and trained CTC models. Furthermore, we train a student model under the supervision of the accent-specific teachers, resulting in an even further complementary model, which achieves +20.1% relative Character Error Rate (CER) reduction compared to the baseline trained without any teacher. Having this effective multi-accent model, we can achieve further improvement for each accent by adapting the model to each accent. Using the accent specific model's outputs to regularize the adapting process (i.e., a knowledge distillation version of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence) results in even superior performance compared to the conventional approach using general teacher models.","","978-1-5386-4334-1","10.1109/SLT.2018.8639566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8639566","speech recognition;student-teacher learning;multi-accent acoustic model;end-to-end models","Data models;Hidden Markov models;Adaptation models;Speech recognition;Acoustics;Neural networks;Training","","8","","28","IEEE","14 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the application of I4.0 technologies in this sector has hardly been examined yet. For determining I4.0 potentials in the electric motor production, a structured approach is required since the variety of sub-processes and production technologies results in a vast number of possible combinations. Therefore, this paper first compares different generic approaches for identifying, selecting and implementing I4.0 use cases. Building on this, a methodical approach is derived in order to tap the numerous I4.0 potentials within the electric motor production. On the one hand, use cases can be derived from current technological opportunities resulting from application examples and best practices in research and industry. On the other hand, concrete problems in critical manufacturing processes can give rise to the application of novel I4.0 solutions. By presenting a comprehensive overview of promising application scenarios, this paper mainly facilitates the identification of I4.0 potentials in the electric motor production from an opportunity-driven perspective. In addition to approaches directly addressing the electric motor production, concepts can be derived from related processes in other application domains. Examples are provided by outlining a selection of the presumably most relevant use cases. The results indicate that especially data-driven approaches, i.e. data analytics and machine learning, offer great potential in electric motor production. As an outlook, I4.0 potentials can also be disclosed from a problem-pull perspective, supplementing the opportunity-push approach of this paper.","","978-1-7281-0148-4","10.1109/EDPC.2018.8658294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658294","Industry 4.0;electric motors;production systems;use cases;methodology;data analytics;machine learning;knowledge-based systems;computer vision;robotics;digital twin","Electric motors;Electric potential;Data mining;Robot sensing systems;Production systems","","19","1","167","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method using deep transfer learning (DFDD), which realizes fault diagnosis both in the development and maintenance phases. At first, the potential problems that are not considered at design time can be discovered through front running the ultra-high-fidelity model in the virtual space, while a deep neural network (DNN)-based diagnosis model will be fully trained. In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as avoids wasting time and knowledge. A case study about fault diagnosis using DFDD in a car body-side production line is presented.

Using active preference learning, we iteratively show alternative paths that the robot could take on an interface. From the user feedback on ranking the alternatives, we learn about the weights that users place on each part of their specification. We extend the user model from our previous work to a discrete Bayesian learning model and introduce a greedy algorithm for proposing alternative that operates on the notion of equivalence regions of user weights.

Recently, various works based on differential privacy have been proposed to protect an individual's privacy in the machine learning and deep learning contexts. One of the state-of-the-art approaches is Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE), a generic framework which can be successfully applied to many different learning algorithms. In PATE, we need to split the private dataset into many disjoint subsets and train an ensemble of teachers on these subsets. Then, we transfer noisy predictions from the ensemble of teachers to a student model. In this paper, we show that for complex datasets and tasks, such as nature image classification, the training set allocated for one teacher may be too small with respect to the corresponding task to achieve an ideal performance.

The currently most efficient method trains a deep network directly on compressed video containing the motion information. However, this method has a large number of parameters. We propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework for compressed video action recognition to compress this model. With this framework, the model is compressed by transferring the knowledge from multiple teachers to a single small student model. With multi-teacher knowledge distillation, students learn better than with single-teacher knowledge distillation.

One shortcoming of the T/S learning is that a teacher model, not always perfect, sporadically produces wrong guidance in form of posterior probabilities that misleads the student model towards a suboptimal performance. To overcome this problem, we propose a conditional T/S learning scheme, in which a ""smart"" student model selectively chooses to learn from either the teacher model or the ground truth labels conditioned on whether the teacher can correctly predict the ground truth. Unlike a naive linear combination of the two knowledge sources, the conditional learning is exclusively engaged with the teacher model when the teacher model's prediction is correct, and otherwise backs off to the ground truth. Thus, the student model is able to learn effectively from the teacher and even potentially surpass the teacher. We examine the proposed learning scheme on two tasks: domain adaptation on CHiME-3 dataset and speaker adaptation on Microsoft short message dictation dataset. The proposed method achieves 9.8% and 12.8% relative word error rate reductions, respectively, over T/S learning for environment adaptation and speaker-independent model for speaker adaptation.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-8131-1","10.1109/ICASSP.2019.8683438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8683438","teacher-student learning;domain adaptation;speaker adaptation","Adaptation models;Predictive models;Acoustics;Task analysis;Training;Data models;Computational modeling","","38","2","40","IEEE","17 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current ground-based flight planning systems utilize aircraft type specific performance tables to determine fuel flows for given flight conditions and parameters such as altitude, mass and speed. These tables are corrected by a performance factor as the aircraft ages. Despite this update, planned fuel consumption may indeed not overlap with the actual one. In order to synchronize the base aircraft model with aircraft's actual performance, we propose using state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for building data-driven models of fuel flows. Towards this goal, aircraft's on-board recorded trajectory and parameter data, namely Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data are utilized. The total dataset used within this study comprises of more than 1000 B777-300ER flights from a major European flag carrier airline. The deep neural network architecture is utilized for modeling the actual fuel flow specific to each aircraft and for each major flight mode (climb, cruise and descent namely). We have developed three neural network architectures (according to in-flight and ground based planning use cases) to present a tail-number specific correction factor to Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) models. First architecture involves a QAR data based black-box fuel flow model utilizing in-flight throttle data from all the engines. Comparison of this model with real flight data shows that precise estimation of fuel flow with mean errors lower than %0.1 can be achieved. The second architecture utilizes a physically consistent data regeneration of δT (delta thrust) using BADA formulation as to account for the ground planning phase where throttle information is not available. The third model involves a cascaded architecture which utilizes a neural network throttle estimator and the black-box QAR fuel flow model for again the ground planning phase. Comparison of the latter models with real flight data shows that precise estimation of fuel flow with mean absolute errors lower than %0.7 can be achieved at all the flight modes. Initial tests reflect the fact that even better accuracy can be achieved for all models as the data set size increases. Finally, ground based planning fuel flow models are applied to actual flight plans generated by ground based systems. Total trip fuel comparisons show discrepancies up to %3.5 total fuel loading weight, which may result in potential fuel savings by decreasing the fuel load during take-off. Comparison of the planned and the estimated fuel boarding weights (following the actual filed flight plans) for 91 long-haul flights show that fuel burn savings of around 800 [k g] per flight could have been achieved by the proposed methodology at the ground planning phase. For a typical operation of 100 long-haul flights per day, this represents yearly savings on the order of around 17 million USD at current jet fuel prices. This “tail-number specific” performance modeling approach is projected to open considerable frontiers including the in-flight update of performance models through machine learning methods.","1095-323X","978-1-5386-6854-2","10.1109/AERO.2019.8741729","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8741729","","Fuels;Aircraft;Atmospheric modeling;Mathematical model;Planning;Data models;Estimation","","10","","24","IEEE","20 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is often a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability of models. In this paper, we address this tradeoff by first developing a robust but complex teacher machine learning model to map the subjective Net Promoter Score (NPS) values computed from the user quality feedback to the underlying subset of KPI metrics. Next, we develop a rather interpretable student model supervised by the pre-trained teacher model. Eventually the compact student decision tree model learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher model with an at least 10 % improved accuracy in testset as compared to conventional way of directly training using the decision tree model.

Research has shown that adaptive e-learning improves the effectiveness of e-learning systems and removes the loneliness experienced by learners when they are online. Though this is the case, adaptive e-learning systems face the challenge of not only utilizing one learner characteristic to provide adaptation but also the problem of deciding which learner characteristic to model. This study was carried out in order to develop a learner model based on learning theories since learning theories do spell out on how learning occurs and therefore useful in determining which learner characteristic to model. Systematic literature review on articles dealing with adaptive e-learning was carried out. Articles were extracted from various databases and were selected using a three step process. 16 articles were selected for the final analysis. The results of the analysis indicate that, there is evidence of basing adaptive e-learning systems on learning theories and the most utilized theory is cognitivism. The learner characteristic that is majorly modelled is learning style. In order to capture different learner characteristics we propose a learner model based on the three major learning theories; constructivism, cognitivism and behaviriousim.","2576-8581","978-1-905824-63-2","10.23919/ISTAFRICA.2019.8764826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8764826","Adaptive e-learning;personalised learning;learning theories;education theories","Adaptation models;Electronic learning;Adaptive systems;Face;Databases;Google","","1","","32","","18 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this can be computationally expensive when performing recognition. Teacher-student learning alleviates this cost by training a single student model to emulate the combined ensemble behaviour. Only this student needs to be used for recognition. Previously investigated teacher-student criteria often limit the forms of diversity allowed in the ensemble, and only propagate information from the teachers to the student at the frame level. This paper addresses both of these issues by examining teacher-student learning within a sequence-level framework, and assessing the flexibility that these approaches offer. Various sequence-level teacher-student criteria are examined in this work, to propagate sequence posterior information. A training criterion based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence between context-dependent state sequence posteriors is proposed that allows for a diversity of state cluster sets to be present in the ensemble. This criterion is shown to be an upper bound to a more general KL-divergence between word sequence posteriors, which places even fewer restrictions on the ensemble diversity, but whose gradient can be expensive to compute. These methods are evaluated on the augmented multi-party interaction (AMI) meeting transcription and MGB-3 television broadcast audio tasks.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2019.2929859","University of Cambridge; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8768232","Automatic speech recognition;ensemble;lattice-free;random forest;teacher-student","Diversity reception;Computational modeling;Hidden Markov models;Training;Acoustics;Topology;Speech processing","","5","","38","IEEE","22 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to a great number of customers, e-commerce companies often employ multiple communication channels to answer customers' questions, for example, Chatbot and Hotline. On one hand, each channel has limited capacity to respond to customers' requests; on the other hand, customers have different preferences over these channels. The current production systems are mainly built based on business rules that merely consider the tradeoffs between the resources and customers' satisfaction. To achieve the optimal tradeoff between the resources and customers' satisfaction, we propose a new framework based on deep reinforcement learning that directly takes both resources and user model into account. In addition to the framework, we also propose a new deep-reinforcement-learning-based routing method-double dueling deep Q-learning with prioritized experience replay (PER-DoDDQN). We evaluate our proposed framework and method using both synthetic and a real customer service log data from a large financial technology company. We show that our proposed deep-reinforcement-learning-based framework is superior to the existing production system. Moreover, we also show that our proposed PER-DoDDQN is better than all other deep Q-learning variants in practice, which provides a more optimal routing plan.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to eliminate the tail whenever possible and improve the user equipment power efficiency. We design a self-adaptive tool to optimize the LTE RRC inactivity timer for individual users based on user model.

First, a teacher model with deep architectures is built to learn the target of ideal ratio masks (IRMs) using simulated training pairs of clean and noisy speech data. Next, a student model is trained to learn an improved speech presence probability by incorporating the estimated IRMs from the teacher model into the IMCRA approach. The student model can be compactly designed in a causal processing mode having no latency with the guidance of a complex and noncausal teacher model. Moreover, the clean speech requirement, which is difficult to meet in real-world adverse environments, can be relaxed for training the student model, implying that noisy speech data can be directly used to adapt the regression-based enhancement model to further improve speech recognition accuracies for noisy speech collected in such conditions. Experiments on the CHiME-4 challenge task show that our best student model with bidirectional gated recurrent units (BGRUs) can achieve a relative word error rate (WER) reduction of 18.85% for the real test set when compared to unprocessed system without acoustic model retraining. However, the traditional teacher model degrades the performance of the unprocessed system in this case. In addition, the student model with a deep neural network (DNN) in causal mode having no latency yields a relative WER reduction of 7.94% over the unprocessed system with 670 times less computing cycles when compared to the BGRU-equipped student model. Finally, the conventional speech enhancement and IRM-based deep learning method destroyed the ASR performance when the recognition system became more powerful.

Conventional product development systems, however, fail to fully adopt ML algorithms on the increasingly available AM data for knowledge acquisition. To address the limitation, this paper proposes an algorithmic framework for constructing AM knowledge automatically and continuously from data. The proposed algorithm develops predictive models to correlate process parameters with part structure and properties using ML algorithms on design, process control, in-situ monitoring, and ex-situ measurement AM data. Based on the predictive models, the algorithm constructs prescriptive rules necessary for decision-making in AM product developments. The constructed rule knowledge is stored in a knowledge base by the algorithm for further AM knowledge query and constructions. Then, the algorithm provides feedback to a knowledge-query formulation phase, which forms the algorithm into a closed loop. Through the algorithm, AM knowledge can self-evolve continuously, while reflecting dynamically generated AM data in an automated and autonomous manner. A case study is presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm and a software prototype is developed to demonstrate the algorithm capability.","2161-8089","978-1-7281-0356-3","10.1109/COASE.2019.8843316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8843316","","Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Decision making;Knowledge based systems;Software algorithms;Data mining","","14","","23","IEEE","19 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such system can serve the dual purpose of replicating the physical system, so as to simulate specific `what if' scenarios as well as to generate large scale synthetic data with patho-physiological interpretability. Cardio-vascular Digital twin is modeled with a two chambered heart, haemodynamic equations and a baroreflex based pressure control mechanism to generate blood pressure and flow variations. Synthetic PPG signal is generated from the model for healthy and Atherosclerosis condition. Initial validation of the platform has been made on the basis of efficiency of the platform in clustering Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and non CAD PPG data by extracting features from the synthetically generated PPG and comparing that with PPG obtained from Physionet data.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-1311-5","10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8856691","","Mathematical model;Solid modeling;Heart;Blood;Blood pressure;Feature extraction","Algorithms;Baroreflex;Cardiovascular System;Electrocardiography;Heart Rate;Hemodynamics;Homeostasis;Humans;Photoplethysmography;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","23","","25","IEEE","7 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, requirement of a large number of labelled identities leads to high cost for large-scale Re-ID systems. Consequently, it is significant to study learning Re-ID with unlabelled data and limited labelled data, that is, semi-supervised person re-identification. When labelled data is limited, the learned model tends to overfit the data and cannot generalize well. Moreover, the scene variations between cameras lead to domain shift in the feature space, which makes mining auxiliary supervision information from unlabelled data more difficult. To address these problems, we propose a Distilled Camera-Aware Self Training framework for semi-supervised person re-identification. To alleviate the overfitting problem for learning from limited labelled data, we propose a Multi-Teacher Selective Similarity Distillation Loss to selectively aggregate the knowledge of multiple weak teacher models trained with different subsets and distill a stronger student model. Then, we exploit the unlabelled data by learning pseudo labels by clustering based on the student model for self training. To alleviate the effect of scene variations between cameras, we propose a Camera-Aware Hierarchical Clustering (CAHC) algorithm to perform intra-camera clustering and cross-camera clustering hierarchically.

Furthermore, developments in design of virtual environments makes it possible to perform simulations in a virtual environment, to enable human-in-the-loop production of parts correctly the first time like never before. Such powerful simulation and control software provides the means to design a digital twin of manufacturing environment in which trials are completed at almost at no cost.

However, this depends largely on the estimation accuracy of the kinematics (body joint angles). This paper presents the concept of a digital equivalent based on the Memory Polynomial Model (MPM) to reduce the number of IMUs needed for the measurements and to simulate the physical mechanism of lower body joint angles based on acceleration data. The MPM parameter estimation is based on the Least Square (LS) approach and is performed using accelerometer records of non-pathological gait patterns. The Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) is used to evaluate the performance of the model. According to the results an NMSE of -20 dB is achieved, which indicates the great potential of applying the MPM to develop a digital twin.

A constructive incremental randomized learning method termed OLS-φ-ESN is proposed for generating the nodes of the extended static nonlinear hidden layer. Two-step training paradigm is adopted, namely, randomly assigning the input weights and biases of the hidden neurons in the extended static layer according to a supervisory mechanism and solving output weights by least squares algorithm.

The Web offers several platforms for distance learning, calibrated for the public or private sector. Among these, the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are one of the most popular online learning assets. In MOOCs, a crucial feature is given by the amount of enrolled learners: thousands can attend such courses. Consequently, monitoring the learning process of individual students is a challenging task for teachers in MOOCs. Peer Assessment can be used, in these case, as a teaching strategy, to follow the dynamics of a MOOC while not checking directly on each one of the individual students. In previous work we have presented a method to support peer assessment, and grades inference, mediated by a limited grading work performed by the teacher. The method is based on a definition of student model based on a modified version of the machine learning technique called K-NN. In this paper we present a system able to simulate the dynamics of a MOOC class where peer assessment, mediated by the teacher, takes place. The system supports the creation of a (big) class, and the simulation of peer assessment sessions, where peer grading, and teacher grading take place. The system, then, allows for a statistical analysis of how the student models computed by the system, and the grades inferred for the peers' tasks, converge towards the real values for the student models and grades.","2380-1603","978-1-7281-2464-3","10.1109/ITHET46829.2019.8937336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8937336","Peer Assessment;MOOCs;Machine Learning","Computational modeling;Computer aided instruction;Machine learning;Task analysis;Data models;Bayes methods;Standards","","2","","15","IEEE","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is mainly achieved with the use of student modelling which is employed to record user context and to enhance the learning experience of the students. In this work, we present a generic ontology that incorporates concepts and properties used to model user profiles in order to formulate concrete, complete and extensible user modelling in e-learning systems. The ontology consists of learners' personal, cognitive and social information as well as information about their performance and skills. In order to keep the student model updated, semantic rules are utilized to analyse student learning and to extract knowledge regarding their performance.

We consider the scalability problem of Re-ID from three aspects: (1) low labelling cost by reducing label amount, (2) low extension cost by reusing existing knowledge and (3) low testing computation cost by using lightweight models. The requirements render scalable Re-ID a challenging problem. To solve these problems in a unified system, we propose a Multi-teacher Adaptive Similarity Distillation Framework, which requires only a few labelled identities of target domain to transfer knowledge from multiple teacher models to a user-specified lightweight student model without accessing source domain data. We propose the Log-Euclidean Similarity Distillation Loss for Re-ID and further integrate the Adaptive Knowledge Aggregator to select effective teacher models to transfer target-adaptive knowledge.

A promising high level approach tackling this limitation is knowledge distillation, which let small student model mimic cumbersome teacher model's output to get improved generalization. However, related methods mainly focus on simple task of classification while do not consider complex tasks like object detection. We show applying the vanilla knowledge distillation to detection model gets minor gain. To address the challenge of distilling knowledge in detection model, we propose a fine-grained feature imitation method exploiting the cross-location discrepancy of feature response. Our intuition is that detectors care more about local near object regions. Thus the discrepancy of feature response on the near object anchor locations reveals important information of how teacher model tends to generalize. We design a novel mechanism to estimate those locations and let student model imitate the teacher on them to get enhanced performance. We first validate the idea on a developed lightweight toy detector which carries simplest notion of current state-of-the-art anchor based detection models on challenging KITTI dataset, our method generates up to 15% boost of mAP for the student model compared to the non-imitated counterpart. We then extensively evaluate the method with Faster R-CNN model under various scenarios with common object detection benchmark of Pascal VOC and COCO, imitation alleviates up to 74% performance drop of student model compared to teacher.

In this paper, we develop an adaptive teacher-and-student model for heterogeneous domain adaptation (AtsHDA). In AtsHDA, the source domain as a teacher and the target domain as a student are aligned or co-adapted to each other first, so that their correlation can be maximized. Then the target domain adaptively learns from the source domain. Specifically, there is a balance between the learning by the target domain itself and the instruction from the source domain. That is, when the guidance from the source domain is helpful for learning, the learning of target classifier emphasizes the instruction of source knowledge, and considers its own knowledge more, otherwise. Further, an ensemble method is designed to decide such a balance.

The protocol phases are as follows: remedial training (as diagnostic and information collecting), configuration of a user model, planning of instructional plan based on user model, plan implementation, evaluation. The proposal is a kind of remedial training based on computer, many scientific research publications demonstrating that remedial training as a viable solution to reduction of Dyslexia. The findings are very similar to previous studies about that computer software has been a viable support of remedial training; studies refers to many points where remedial training could be useful, the first one is training in phonological structure of the words in the native language to reach a minimal level of phonological awareness; The best recommendation is training in phonological awareness before to learn to read and write; training in phonological awareness seems to have many benefits in reduction of Dyslexia and increment of reading skills [1]. The proposal reports favorable results using Testing Effect, which is a concept of cognitive psychology that enhanced long-term memory known; Testing effect had not been commonly associated as a remedial training for Dyslexia but many studies in other areas have shown promising results in basic operations like reading, writing and learning. Testing effect enhances long-term memory by doing many tests, this process of retrieving makes the information more retrievable even in long-term compared to simply studying. To implement this proposal we did use an electronic format content known as Learning Objects. Learning Object has many benefits like interoperability because it is a piece of software that can be easily read by many electronical dispositive and can contain an activity of assessment of learning as quizzes or tests. That is the particularities and philosophy of Learning Object as technology of contents. During this first phase (diagnostic), the goal of using Learning Object was testing of word recognition with test of multiple option. In this study, there is not a phonological awareness training, the testing was with one person only who is a 9 years old boy, and the training was useful and get higher results in word recognition within this context. The goal of use a remedial training supported with computer is to reduce absence from school and integrate the individual into any society activity that include reading and writing.","","978-1-7281-5436-7","10.1109/CONTIE49246.2019.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8971414","Phonological awareness, Dyslexia, Learning Object, Testing Effect","Training;Testing;Psychology;Proposals;Protocols;Software","","1","","28","IEEE","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In previous works, it is often shown that learning from a strong teacher allows the student to perform better than an equivalent model trained with only the reference transcriptions. However, there has not been much investigation into whether a particular form of teacher is appropriate for the student to learn from. This paper aims to study how effectively the student is able to learn from the teacher, when differences exist between their designs. The Augmented Multi-party Interaction (AMI) meeting transcription and Multi-Genre Broadcast (MGB-3) television broadcast audio tasks are used in this analysis.

However, we find that the representation of a converged heavy model is still a strong constraint for training a small student model, which leads to a higher lower bound of congruence loss. In this work, we consider the knowledge distillation from the perspective of curriculum learning by teacher's routing. Instead of supervising the student model with a converged teacher model, we supervised it with some anchor points selected from the route in parameter space that the teacher model passed by, as we called route constrained optimization (RCO). We experimentally demonstrate this simple operation greatly reduces the lower bound of congruence loss for knowledge distillation, hint and mimicking learning.

These methods always involve two roles, an explicit or implicit teacher model and a student model, and penalize predictions under different perturbations by a consistency constraint. However, the weights of these two roles are tightly coupled since the teacher is essentially an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student. In this work, we show that the coupled EMA teacher causes a performance bottleneck. To address this problem, we introduce Dual Student, which replaces the teacher with another student. We also define a novel concept, stable sample, following which a stabilization constraint is designed for our structure to be trainable. Further, we discuss two variants of our method, which produce even higher performance. Extensive experiments show that our method improves the classification performance significantly on several main SSL benchmarks. Specifically, it reduces the error rate of the 13-layer CNN from 16.84% to 12.39% on CIFAR-10 with 1k labels and from 34.10% to 31.56% on CIFAR-100 with 10k labels.

However, most cameras observe only a very small fraction of this distribution. This offers the possibility of achieving more efficient inference by specializing compact, low-cost models to the specific distribution of frames observed by a single camera. In this paper, we employ the technique of model distillation (supervising a low-cost student model using the output of a high-cost teacher) to specialize accurate, low-cost semantic segmentation models to a target video stream. Rather than learn a specialized student model on offline data from the video stream, we train the student in an online fashion on the live video, intermittently running the teacher to provide a target for learning. Online model distillation yields semantic segmentation models that closely approximate their Mask R-CNN teacher with 7 to 17× lower inference runtime cost (11 to 26× in FLOPs), even when the target video's distribution is non-stationary. Our method requires no offline pretraining on the target video stream, achieves higher accuracy and lower cost than solutions based on flow or video object segmentation, and can exhibit better temporal stability than the original teacher. We also provide a new video dataset for evaluating the efficiency of inference over long running video streams.","2380-7504","978-1-7281-4803-8","10.1109/ICCV.2019.00367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9010320","","Streaming media;Adaptation models;Training;Semantics;Computer architecture;Computational modeling;Cameras","","34","","48","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From the remote sensing perspective, this problem can also be considered in line with the missing bands problem frequently encountered due to sensor abnormality. It is expected that different modalities provide useful complementary information regarding a given task, thus leading to the training of a robust prediction model. Although training data may be collected from different sensor modalities, it is many a time possible that not all the information are readily available during the model inference phase. This paper tackles the problem by proposing a novel adversarial training driven hallucination architecture which is capable of learning discriminative feature representations corresponding to the missing modalities from the available ones during the test time. To this end, we follow a teacher-student model where the teacher is trained on the multimodal data (learning with privileged information) and the student model learns to subsequently distill the feature descriptors corresponding to the missing modality. Experimental results obtained on the benchmark hyperspectral (HSI) datasets and another dataset of multispectral (MS)-panchromatic (PAN) image pairs confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach. In particular, we find that the student model is consistently able to surpass the performance of the teacher model for HSI datasets.","2473-9944","978-1-7281-5023-9","10.1109/ICCVW.2019.00558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9022062","Cross modal learning;Hyperspectral images","Training;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Data models;Remote sensing;Fuses;Computer architecture","","13","","45","IEEE","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to the conventional strategy of knowledge distillation in classification or semantic segmentation networks which are both single-task networks, we investigate a hierarchical distillation (H-Dis) framework for structure information distillation on multi-task learning based instance segmentation. H-Dis consists of two distillation schemes: representation distillation that distills pair-wise quantized feature maps shared by multi-heads, and semantic distillation that makes sure to distill each head information in an instance level. In particular, we present channel-wise distillation for the segmentation head to achieve instance-level mask knowledge transfer. To evaluate our approach, we carry out experiments with different settings of distillation methods on different datasets Pascal VOC and Cityscapes.

By means of end-to-end modeling and parameters sharing, a single model can be efficiently trained and deployed for all languages. Although the single model benefits from jointly training across different languages, it should handle the variation and diversity of the languages at the same time. In this paper, we exploit knowledge distillation from multiple teachers to improve the recognition accuracy of the end-to-end multilingual model. Considering that teacher models learning from monolingual and multilingual data contain distinct knowledge of specific languages, we introduce multiple teachers including monolingual teachers of each language, and multilingual teacher to teach a same sized multilingual student model so that the multilingual student will learn various knowledge embedded in the data and intend to outperform multilingual teacher. Different from conventional knowledge distillation which usually relies on a linear interpolation for hard loss from true label and soft losses from teachers, a new random augmented training strategy is proposed to switch the optimization of the student model between hard or soft losses in random order.

Choosing the right learning object and recommending it to learners is a challenge for online learning systems. At present, the problem faced by online learning is that the information overload causes the learner cannot find a learning resource suitable for himself, and the recommended learning resource cannot satisfy the individual needs of the learner. The recommendation system is an important means of information filtering and a very promising method for solving information overload problems. Therefore, adaptive learning path recommendation is considered to be an effective means to solve the above problems in online learning. In this paper, we propose a learning path generation algorithm based on network embedding and learning effects. First, we use the network embedding to learn the user's expression in order to judge the learner's similarity. Then we generate an adaptive learning path for current learners based on the similarity between all historical learners and current learners and the learning effects of historical learners. The experimental results show that the average grade of the learners using our recommended learning path has been greatly improved.

The transfer learning framework is based on a distill and refine strategy, in which the teacher model is first distilled into a student model and, successively, refined by data samples coming from the target geographical area. The proposed strategy is compared with different approaches including a random forest (RF) classifier trained on the target data set and a CNN trained on the source data set and directly applied on the target area as well as several CNN classifiers trained on the target data set.

Existing visual food recognition approaches usually use large server-based networks to achieve high accuracy. However, these networks are not compact enough to be deployed on mobile devices. Even though some compact architectures have been proposed, most of them are unable to obtain the performance of full-size networks. In view of this, this paper proposes a Joint-learning Distilled Network (JDNet) that targets to achieve a high food recognition accuracy of a compact student network by learning from a large teacher network, while retaining a compact network size. Compared to the conventional one-directional knowledge distillation methods, the proposed JDNet has a novel joint-learning framework where the large teacher network and the small student network are trained simultaneously, by leveraging on different intermediate layer features in both network.

Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications.

However, the pooling operation of the CNN has the disadvantage of losing the location information of the target object. We don't use the pooling operation, retaining ReLU and convolution operation, and we use the dictionary strong constraints and penalty function prior constraints of the multi-layer convolutional sparse coding (ML-CSC). We proposed iterative deep neural networks, the unfolded multi-layer local block coordinate descent networks (ML-LoBCoD-NET), driven by the multi-layer local block coordinate descent algorithm (ML-LoBCoD) which is extended from the local block coordinate descent (LoBCoD) algorithm. The ML-LoBCoD-NET can extract features different from the CNN. More importantly, for weakly-supervised sound event detection task, we proposed the MRNN-Att network which combines the ML-LoBCoD-NET, a recurrent neural network (RNN), and an attention network. The MCRNN-Att network combines MRNN-Att and CRNN network for fusing the different features. Furthermore, for semi-supervised sound event detection task, the MRNN-Att mean teacher model (MRNN-Att-MT) and the MCRNN-Att mean teacher model (MCRNN-Att-MT) are proposed, in which the MRNN-Att and the MCRNN-Att network are selected as the student model.

Learner-system discussion, editing or other interaction about the learner model can allow users to contribute more directly to the modeling process to increase its accuracy, while at the same time, further facilitating reflection as they justify their viewpoints to themselves and the system. Social learning can be supported by opening learner models to peers, helping learners to gauge their relative progress, and effectively seek collaborators.

Such datasets are difficult to obtain because privacy concerns prevent the majority of intrusion detection agencies from sharing their sensitive data. In this paper, we propose the use of mimic learning to enable the transfer of intrusion detection knowledge through a teacher model trained on private data to a student model.

This is because sharing the patients' medical records is prohibited by law in most countries due to patients privacy concerns. In this paper, we tackle this problem by sharing the models instead of the original sensitive data by using the mimic learning approach. The idea is first to train a model on the original sensitive data, called the teacher model. Then, using this model, we can transfer its knowledge to another model, called the student model, without the need to learn the original data used in training the teacher model. The student model is then shared to the public and can be used to make accurate predictions. To assess the mimic learning approach, we have evaluated our scheme using different medical datasets.

In this paper, we propose a bridge distillation approach to turn a complex face model pretrained on private high-resolution faces into a light-weight one for low-resolution face recognition. In our approach, such a cross-dataset resolution-adapted knowledge transfer problem is solved via two-step distillation. In the first step, we conduct cross-dataset distillation to transfer the prior knowledge from private high-resolution faces to public high-resolution faces and generate compact and discriminative features. In the second step, the resolution-adapted distillation is conducted to further transfer the prior knowledge to synthetic low-resolution faces via multi-task learning.

Deep learning has a potential to automate this task but requires a large set of high-quality annotations that are difficult to collect. Learning from noisy training labels that are easier to obtain has a potential to alleviate this problem. To this end, we propose a novel noise-robust framework to learn from noisy labels for the segmentation task. We first introduce a noise-robust Dice loss that is a generalization of Dice loss for segmentation and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss for robustness against noise, then propose a novel COVID-19 Pneumonia Lesion segmentation network (COPLE-Net) to better deal with the lesions with various scales and appearances. The noise-robust Dice loss and COPLE-Net are combined with an adaptive self-ensembling framework for training, where an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of a student model is used as a teacher model that is adaptively updated by suppressing the contribution of the student to EMA when the student has a large training loss. The student model is also adaptive by learning from the teacher only when the teacher outperforms the student. Experimental results showed that: (1) our noise-robust Dice loss outperforms existing noise-robust loss functions, (2) the proposed COPLE-Net achieves higher performance than state-of-the-art image segmentation networks, and (3) our framework with adaptive self-ensembling significantly outperforms a standard training process and surpasses other noise-robust training approaches in the scenario of learning from noisy labels for COVID-19 pneumonia lesion segmentation.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2020.3000314","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:81771921,61901084); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9109297","COVID-19;convolutional neural network;noisy label;segmentation;pneumonia","Noise measurement;Image segmentation;Lesions;Lung;Training;COVID-19","Algorithms;Betacoronavirus;Coronavirus Infections;Deep Learning;Humans;Lung;Pandemics;Pneumonia, Viral;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","277","","48","IEEE","5 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the “softwarization” of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT.

Digital Twin process workflow is proposed in case of Mohammed VI Bridge modeling in Morocco. The current maintenance of a road infrastructure is based on a manual inspection and a system based on traditional tools. Aging infrastructures require a new approach to maintenance in terms of inspection, bridge maintenance system, simulation and systematic evaluation. This system now exists and is called the Digital Twin. Digital Twin can be thought of as a virtual prototype in service that changes dynamically in near real time as its physical twin changes. An urban infrastructure digital twin is a virtual instance of his physical twin that is continuously updated with multisource, multisensor and multitemporal data that can be used for monitoring, simulating and forecasting any potential problem that may appear in the structure and proposing planning for repair and maintenance of health status throughout the life cycle of this infrastructure. This work presents a general vision and a justification for integrating DT technology with geospatial data. The paper examines the benefits of integrating 3D GIS data acquired by automated mobile mapping (MMS) workflows for modeling the reality of a major bridge infrastructure in Morocco. This allowed to study the future performance of this bridge structure on virtual twin structures under different environmental conditions.

Due to finite shared I/O resource of the UAV in the MEC system, each MU competes to schedule local as well as remote task computations across the decision epochs, aiming to maximize the expected long-term computation performance. The non-cooperative interactions among the MUs are modeled as a stochastic game, in which the decision makings of a MU depend on the global state statistics and the task scheduling policies of all MUs are coupled. To approximate the Nash equilibrium solutions, we propose a proactive scheme based on the long short-term memory and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. A digital twin of the MEC system is established to train the proactive DRL scheme offline. Using the proposed scheme, each MU makes task scheduling decisions only with its own information.

Although there have been successful prototypes from a functional perspective and promising start-ups, the complex nature of the agriculture system of systems creates a significant risk of mass adoption failure. The main risk stems from the majority of the hundreds of products being designed in isolation using closed hardware and software systems that are all aiming to serve the one farmer or grower. The current silo’d technology adoption approach is heading towards problems with usability, availability, viability, interoperability and adaptability. This paper proposes a new time constrained System of Systems (SoS) discovery process and supporting SoS Canvas, developed with the objective of increasing the adoption of SoS principles with non-technical stakeholders.

The outcome of this initial case study prototyping the process, is a set of SysML diagrams demonstrating how the constituent systems currently contribute to emergent properties and recommendations to improve both the SoI and the SoS.

This is especially challenging for energy ecosystems that are increasingly difficult to control and maintain as the number of participating manufacturers and users grows. Digital Twins help analyze and predict these systems in the form of digital reflections that operate in parallel with the physical system. In this paper, we use Machine Learning to improve the predictive power of Digital Twins for Cyber-Physical Energy Systems. Specifically, we use a Temporal Convolutional Neural Network model to learn the temporal patterns in the system and predict its responsiveness to specific power setpoint instructions. Real-life data from ten batteries were used to predict the behavior over time. Compared to the baseline model that uses the prior probability of response and the average response rate within the configured time window, the model predicts the batteries’ responsiveness more accurately. The more temporal information is used as input for prediction, the better the model performs in both precision and recall. The results show that this compensates for the lack of information when fewer metrics are used. The use of Machine Learning for Digital Twins can help maintain a heterogeneous energy ecosystem, while minimizing the need to acquire or disclose detailed information.","","978-1-7281-8721-1","10.1109/MSCPES49613.2020.9133695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9133695","Machine Learning;Digital Twin;Cyber-Physical Energy System;Temporal Convolution Neural Network","Measurement;Convolution;Digital twin;Conferences;Ecosystems;Neural networks;Machine learning","","13","","23","IEEE","7 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To tackle these issues, we propose a novel approach, called Variational Bayesian Group-level Sparsification for Knowledge Distillation (VBGS-KD), to distill a large teacher network into a small and sparse student network while preserving accuracy. We impose the sparsity-inducing prior on the groups of parameters in the student model, and introduce the variational Bayesian approximation to learn structural sparseness, which can effectively prune most part of weights. The prune threshold is learned during training without extra fine-tuning. The proposed method can learn the robust student networks that have achieved satisifying accuracy and compact sizes compared with the state-of-the-arts methods.

In this context, this paper provides a comprehensive classification of related state-of-the-art approaches following three key directions: privacy, authentication and message integrity within VANETs.

In order to extract the information contained in these diagrams, we propose a pipeline for automatically digitizing P&IDs. Our pipeline combines a series of computer vision techniques to detect symbols in a diagram, match symbols with associated text, and detect connections between symbols through lines. For the symbol detection task, we train a Convolutional Neural Network to classify certain common symbols with over 90% precision and recall. To detect connections between symbols, we use a graph search approach to traverse a diagram through its lines and discover interconnected symbols. By transforming unstructured diagrams into structured information, our pipeline enables applications such as diagram search, equipment-to-sensor mapping, and asset hierarchy creation. When integrated with operational and enterprise data, the extracted asset hierarchy serves as the foundation for a facility-wide digital twin, enabling advanced applications such as machine learning-based predictive maintenance.","2160-7516","978-1-7281-9360-1","10.1109/CVPRW50498.2020.00096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9151021","","Pipelines;Sensors;Machine learning;Agriculture;Instruments;Training;Data mining","","18","","8","IEEE","28 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This has realized the need for artificial intelligence tools for robust data processing. However, the large size of input data requires real time monitoring and synchronization for online analysis. As the star concept behind the Industry 4.0 wave, a digital twin is a virtual, multi-scale and probabilistic simulation to mirror the performance of its physical counterpart and serve the product lifecycle in a virtual space. Evidently, a digital twin can proactively identify potential issues with its corresponding real twin. Thus, it is best suited for enabling a physics-based and data-driven model fusion to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the components. Traditional RUL prediction approaches have assumed either an exponential or linear degradation trend with a fixed curve shape to build a Health Index (HI) model. Such an assumption may not be useful for multi-sensor systems or cases where sensor data is available intermittently. A common constraint in the industry is irregular sensor data collection. The resulting asynchronous time series of the sporadic data needs to be an accurate representation of the component's HI when constructing a degradation model. In this paper, we extend the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique to generate RUL prediction within a digital twin framework as a means of synchronization with changing operational states. More specifically, we first use LSTM encoder-decoder (LSTM-ED) to train a multilayered neural network and reconstruct the sensor data time series corresponding to a healthy state. The resulting reconstruction error can be used to capture patterns in input data time series and estimate HI of training and testing sets. Using a time lag to record similarity between the HI curves, a weighted average of the final RUL estimation is obtained. The described empirical approach is evaluated on publicly available engine degradation dataset with run-to-failure information. Results indicate a high RUL estimation accuracy with greater error reduction rate. This demonstrates wide applicability of the discussed methodology to various industries where event data is scarce for the application of only data-driven techniques.","2577-0993","978-1-7281-3690-5","10.1109/RAMS48030.2020.9153669","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9153669","Prognostics;RUL Estimation;Deep Learning;Long-short Term Memory;IIoT;Autoencoder","Time series analysis;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Sensors;Mathematical model;Degradation;Logic gates","","3","","11","IEEE","31 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent methods like Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) leverage a large ensemble of teacher models trained on disjoint subsets of private data, to transfer knowledge to a student model with privacy guarantees. However, labeled vision data is often expensive and datasets, when split into many disjoint training sets, lead to significantly sub-optimal accuracy and thus hardly sustain good privacy bounds. We propose a practically data-efficient scheme based on private release of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) queries, which altogether avoids splitting the training dataset. Our approach allows the use of privacy-amplification by subsampling and iterative refinement of the kNN feature embedding. We rigorously analyze the theoretical properties of our method and demonstrate strong experimental performance on practical computer vision datasets for face attribute recognition and person reidentification. In particular, we achieve comparable or better accuracy than PATE while reducing more than 90% of the privacy loss, thereby providing the “most practical method to-date” for private deep learning in computer vision.","2575-7075","978-1-7281-7168-5","10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.01187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9156598","","Privacy;Feature extraction;Computational modeling;Data models;Training","","19","","30","IEEE","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, a more generalized approach for KD is to distill the teacher's knowledge into both the parameters and architecture of the student. To achieve this, we present a new \textit{Architecture-aware Knowledge Distillation (AKD)} approach that finds student models (pearls for the teacher) that are best for distilling the given teacher model. In particular, we leverage Neural Architecture Search (NAS), equipped with our KD-guided reward, to search for the best student architectures for a given teacher. Experimental results show our proposed AKD consistently outperforms the conventional NAS plus KD approach, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet classification task under various latency settings. Furthermore, the best AKD student architecture for the ImageNet classification task also transfers well to other tasks such as million level face recognition and ensemble learning.","2575-7075","978-1-7281-7168-5","10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9156803","","Task analysis;Knowledge engineering;Training;Neural networks;Computer architecture;Standards;Learning (artificial intelligence)","","31","","45","IEEE","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through experiments in MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, we show that our proposed method, input gradient adversarial matching, can transfer robustness across different tasks and even across different model architectures.

Early methods were usually limited to transferring the knowledge only between the last layers of the networks, while latter approaches were capable of performing multi-layer KD, further increasing the accuracy of the student. However, despite their improved performance, these methods still suffer from several limitations that restrict both their efficiency and flexibility. First, existing KD methods typically ignore that neural networks undergo through different learning phases during the training process, which often requires different types of supervision for each one. Furthermore, existing multi-layer KD methods are usually unable to effectively handle networks with significantly different architectures (heterogeneous KD). In this paper we propose a novel KD method that works by modeling the information flow through the various layers of the teacher model and then train a student model to mimic this information flow. The proposed method is capable of overcoming the aforementioned limitations by using an appropriate supervision scheme during the different phases of the training process, as well as by designing and training an appropriate auxiliary teacher model that acts as a proxy model capable of “explaining” the way the teacher works to the student.

The existing works on offloading in MEC mainly ignore the effects of user mobility and the unpredictable MEC environment. In this paper, we present a new vision of Digital Twin Edge Networks (DITEN) where digital twins (DTs) of edge servers estimate edge servers' states and DT of the entire MEC system provides training data for offloading decision. A mobile offloading scheme is proposed in DITEN to minimize the offloading latency under the constraints of accumulated consumed service migration cost during user mobility. The Lyapunov optimization method is leveraged to simplify the long-term migration cost constraint to a multi-objective dynamic optimization problem, which is then solved by Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning.

However, those studies mainly focused on classification problems, and very few attempts have been made on regression problems, although there are many application of DNNs on regression problems. In this paper, we propose a new formalism of knowledge distillation for regression problems. First, we propose a new loss function, teacher outlier rejection loss, which rejects outliers in training samples using teacher model predictions. Second, we consider a multi-task network with two outputs: one estimates training labels which is in general contaminated by noisy labels; And the other estimates teacher model's output which is expected to modify the noise labels following the memorization effects. By considering the multi-task network, training of the feature extraction of student models becomes more effective, and it allows us to obtain a better student model than one trained from scratch. We performed comprehensive evaluation with one simple toy model: sinusoidal function, and two open datasets: MPIIGaze, and Multi-PIE.

The main reason is due to the large variation of the representation on short utterances which results in high model confusion. To narrow the performance gap between long, and short utterances, we proposed a teacher-student representation learning framework based on a knowledge distillation method to improve LID performance on short utterances. In the proposed framework, in addition to training the student model on short utterances with their true labels, the internal representation from the output of a hidden layer of the student model is supervised with the representation corresponding to their longer utterances. By reducing the distance of internal representations between short, and long utterances, the student model can explore robust discriminative representations for short utterances, which is expected to reduce model confusion.

Digital Twin models integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning and analytics software with the data collected from the production plants to create digital simulation models that update when the parameters of the production processes or the working conditions change. This is a self-learning mechanism, which makes use of data collected from various sources (sensors that transmit operating conditions; experts, such as engineers with deep knowledge of the industrial domain; other similar machines or fleets of similar machines) and integrates also historical data relating to the past use of the machine. Starting from the virtual twin vision, simulation plays a key role within the Industry 4.0 transformation. Creating a virtual prototype has become necessary and strategic to raise the safety levels of the operators engaged in the maintenance phases, but above all the integration of the digital model with the IoT has become particularly effective, as the advent of software platforms offers the possibility of integrating real-time data with all the digital information that a company owns on a given process, ensuring the realization of the Digital Twin. In this context, this work aims at developing optimized solutions for application in a beverage pasteurization system using the Digital Twin approach, capable of creating a virtual modelling of the process and preventing high-risk events for operators.","","978-1-7281-7037-4","10.1109/ICE/ITMC49519.2020.9198625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9198625","Digital Twin;Food equipment;Safety;Industry 4.0","Data models;Industries;Temperature sensors;Context modeling;Predictive models;Liquids","","9","","16","IEEE","16 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By virtualizing and twinning information stemming from the real and the digital world, it is now possible to connect all parts of the production process by having virtual copies of physical elements interacting with each other in the digital and physical realms. However, this alone does not imply cognition. Cognition requires modelling not only the physical characteristics but also the behavior of production elements and processes. The latter can be founded upon data-driven models produced via Data Analytics and Machine Learning techniques, giving rise to the so-called Cognitive (Digital) Twin. To further enable the Cognitive Factory, a novel concept, dubbed as Enhanced Cognitive Twin (ECT), is proposed in this paper as a way to introduce advanced cognitive capabilities to the DT artefact that enable supporting decisions, with the end goal to enable DTs to react to inner or outer stimuli. The Enhanced Cognitive Twin can be deployed at different hierarchical levels of the production process, i.e., at sensor-, machine-, process-, employee- or even factory-level, aggregated to allow both horizontal and vertical interplay. The ECT notion is proposed in the context of process industries, where cognition is particularly important due to the continuous, non-linear, and varied nature of the respective production processes.","","978-1-7281-7037-4","10.1109/ICE/ITMC49519.2020.9198492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9198492","Industry 4.0;Digital Transformation;Cognitive Factory;Digital Twins;Enhanced Cognitive Twins","Cognition;Industries;Production facilities;Data models;Manufacturing;Optimization","","19","","37","IEEE","16 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Innovative technologies and tools are used to provide solutions to existing gaps in current manufacturing systems. The evaluation of scenarios is used to manage risks, costs, prepare for upcoming work and forecast demand. Thus, the use of Digital Twin (DT) has proven its value covering the simulation and creation of virtual environments without the physical investment needed. With emergent technologies comes to a great responsibility for institutes to prepare undergraduate students in the development of novel skills, thus, technologies should be adapted and included into the teaching-learning process to aid the adoption from educational to the industrial sector. In this work, it is shown how the adoption of DT has been used to teach industrial concepts such as the automation pyramid, the programming of programmable logic controllers PLC and the exchange of information through industrial networks along with the concepts that constitute digital twins, such as digital master, digital shadow and modelling through system dynamics.

We hypothesize that these sophisticated models suffer from individual differences of human's personality. Therefore, we proposed a multi characteristic model architecture which combines the personalized machine learning models and utilize each model's prediction score in the inference. This architecture formed with reference to ensemble machine learning architecture. In this research, we focus on a similarity between new user and trained user model by using the idea of applicability domain of machine learning models.

However, the calculation cost becomes enormous as the size of the models becomes larger. Various techniques for compressing the size of the models have been proposed to improve performance while reducing computational costs. One of the methods to compress the size of the models is knowledge distillation (KD). Knowledge distillation is a technique for transferring knowledge of deep or ensemble models with many parameters (teacher model) to smaller shallow models (student model). Since the purpose of knowledge distillation is to increase the similarity between the teacher model and the student model, we propose to introduce the concept of metric learning into knowledge distillation to make the student model closer to the teacher model using pairs or triplets of the training samples. In metric learning, the researchers are developing the methods to build a model that can increase the similarity of outputs for similar samples. Metric learning aims at reducing the distance between similar and increasing the distance between dissimilar. The functionality of the metric learning to reduce the differences between similar outputs can be used for the knowledge distillation to reduce the differences between the outputs of the teacher model and the student model. Since the outputs of the teacher model for different objects are usually different, the student model needs to distinguish them. We think that metric learning can clarify the difference between the different outputs, and the performance of the student model could be improved. We have performed experiments to compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods. The results show that the student model obtained by the proposed method gives higher performance than the conventional knowledge distillation methods.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207148","Convolutional Neural Network;Metric Learning;triplet loss;knowledge distillation","Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Training;Convolution;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction","","4","","18","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For instance, person re-identification systems typically rely on a distributed set of cameras, where each camera has different capture conditions. This can translate to a considerable shift between source (e.g. lab setting) and target (e.g. operational camera) domains. Given the cost of annotating image data captured for fine-tuning in each target domain, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has become a popular approach to adapt CNNs. Moreover, state-of-the-art deep learning models that provide a high level of accuracy often rely on architectures that are too complex for real-time applications. Although several compression and UDA approaches have recently been proposed to overcome these limitations, they do not allow optimizing a CNN to simultaneously address both. In this paper, we propose an unexplored direction - the joint optimization of CNNs to provide a compressed model that is adapted to perform well for a given target domain. In particular, the proposed approach performs unsupervised knowledge distillation (KD) from a complex teacher model to a compact student model, by leveraging both source and target data. It also improves upon existing UDA techniques by progressively teaching the student about domain-invariant features, instead of directly adapting a compact model on target domain data. Our method is compared against state-of-the-art compression and UDA techniques, using two popular classification datasets for UDA - Office31 and ImageClef-DA. In both datasets, results indicate that our method can achieve the highest level of accuracy while requiring a comparable or lower time complexity.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9206989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9206989","Deep Learning;Convolutional Neural Networks;Domain Adaptation;Knowledge Distillation;Visual Recognition","Adaptation models;Data models;Image coding;Computational modeling;Cameras;Complexity theory","","8","","41","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The digital twins enable access to real-time information about the production system. They also constitute the environment for training the agent of the reinforcement learning method. The environment works as a virtual plant, containing the attributes of the product and resources, and uses simulation models of the resources to calculate the reward for an action in terms of reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning enables our approach to derive process plans via trial and error. Besides the virtual plant, our approach has a planner, which plays the role of the agent to derive near-optimal plans by trying different actions in the virtual plant, and observes the rewards. We apply the Q-learning algorithm to derive near optimal process plans. The evaluation results show that our approach is able to derive near-optimal process plans for different problem sizes.

However, the mapping of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) model on RRAM suffers from realistic device issues, especially the variation and quantization error, resulting in a significant reduction in inference accuracy. In this work, we first extract these statistical properties from 65 nm RRAM data on 300mm wafers. The RRAM data present 10-levels in quantization and 50% variance, resulting in an accuracy drop to 31.76% and 10.49% for MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Based on the experimental data, we propose a combination of machine learning algorithms and on-line adaptation to recover the accuracy with the minimum overhead. The recipe first applies Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer an ideal model into a student model with statistical variations and 10 levels. Furthermore, an on-line sparse adaptation (OSA) method is applied to the DNN model mapped on to the RRAM array. Using importance sampling, OSA adds a small SRAM array that is sparsely connected to the main RRAM array; only this SRAM array is updated to recover the accuracy. As demonstrated on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, a 7.86% area cost is sufficient to achieve baseline accuracy for the 65 nm RRAM devices.","0738-100X","978-1-7281-1085-1","10.1109/DAC18072.2020.9218605","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218605","Robustness;in-memory computing;Resistive random access memory (RRAM);Knowledge Distillation;on-line adaptation","Adaptation models;Resistance;Quantization (signal);Training;Switches;Computational modeling;Semiconductor device modeling","","22","","24","IEEE","9 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These attacks vary from exploiting backdoors to disrupting the communication network of the devices. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play an essential role in ensuring information privacy and security of IoT devices against these attacks. Recently, deep learning-based IDS techniques are becoming more prominent due to their high classification accuracy. However, conventional deep learning techniques jeopardize user privacy due to the transfer of user data to a centralized server. Federated learning (FL) is a popular privacy-preserving decentralized learning method. FL enables training models locally at the edge devices and transferring local models to a centralized server instead of transferring sensitive data. Nevertheless, FL can suffer from reverse engineering ML attacks that can learn information about the user's data from model. To overcome the problem of reverse engineering, mimic learning is another way to preserve the privacy of ML-based IDS. In mimic learning, a student model is trained with the public dataset, which is labeled with the teacher model that is trained by sensitive user data. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines the advantages of FL and mimic learning, namely federated mimic learning to create a distributed IDS while minimizing the risk of jeopardizing users' privacy, and benchmark its performance compared to other ML-based IDS techniques using NSL-KDD dataset. Our results show that we can achieve 98.11% detection accuracy with federated mimic learning.","","978-1-7281-7127-2","10.1109/BlackSeaCom48709.2020.9234959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9234959","Federated Learning;Mimic Learning;Intrusion Detection Systems;Internet of Things;Privacy-Preserving","Data models;Data privacy;Training;Servers;Intrusion detection;Benchmark testing;Feature extraction","","15","","15","IEEE","27 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Vulnerability detection is a fundamental technology for cyber resilience in healthcare digital twins. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been applied to address the limitations of traditional machine learning in vulnerability detection. However, it is important to consider code context relationships and pay attention on the vulnerability related keywords for searching an IoT vulnerability in healthcare digital twins. Due to massive software and complexity of healthcare digital twin, a full automatic solution is really needed for assisting cyber resilience check in the real-world scenarios.

To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of the derived models for thermal rating calculation are indicated by comparison to the analytical method given by the IEC 60287 on an example. Accurate mathematical models with real time calculation capabilities and prediction accuracies in the range of 98 to 99% could be derived on the basis of relatively small data sets and implementation of external data.","2687-8860","978-1-7281-8294-0","10.1109/ISC251055.2020.9239014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9239014","Power Cables;Thermal Rating;Environmental Parameter Modelling;Machine Learning;Big Data","Temperature sensors;Temperature distribution;Power cables;Real-time systems;Data models;Communication cables;Mathematical model","","2","","19","IEEE","29 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Identifying the dish type in the mixed dish is essential for dietary tracking, which gains increasing research attention recently. Nevertheless, mixed dish detection is a challenging task because of large visual variances among dishes in different canteens, which is known as the domain shifting problem. Since collecting and annotating sufficient training samples in each canteen for model training is difficult, a more practical way is developing detection models that can adapt quickly to cross-canteen mixed-dish detection with less supervision information. To this end, we propose a novel framework called Weakly-supervised Mean Teacher Network (WMT-Net) that addresses this specific detection task in a weakly supervised manner, where bounding box annotations are not required in the target domain. The proposed WMT-Net constructs Mean Teacher learning by maintaining the image-level consistency between teacher and student modules. Specifically, WMT-Net firstly learns instance-level information from the source dataset in a fully supervised fashion for the student model. Then the whole architecture is optimized with weakly supervised learning: 1) weakly supervised training in student model to reduce the domain gap in global semantics between source data and target data, 2) image-level consistency to align the image-level predictions between teacher model and student model. Experimental results on mixed-dish dataset show that even the proposed WMT-Net is trained in a weakly supervised fashion on the target domain, the performances attained by WMT-Net are very close to the model trained in a fully supervised fashion, which verify the effectiveness of WMT-Net. In addition, the proposed WMT-Net also achieves 44.6% mAP on Pascal VOC to Clipart cross-domain detection, which improves 7.2% mAP compared with the state-of-the-arts method and further demonstrates its generalization capabilities.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3035715","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1002202); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871004); 242 Project(grant numbers:2020A077); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9247093","Cross domain;detection;food recognition;weakly supervised","Training;Adaptation models;Annotations;Object detection;Visualization;Supervised learning;Semisupervised learning","","2","","47","CCBYNCND","3 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data is collected in real time streams from physical resource and process twins, aggregated in time series and sent to the intelligent agents in the cloud without delaying production. Experiments discuss the forecast of abnormal pick-and-place robot operations.","2372-1618","978-1-7281-9809-5","10.1109/ICSTCC50638.2020.9259684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9259684","intelligent manufacturing;digital twin;machine learning;predictive control;cloud manufacturing","Production;Optimization;Manufacturing;Cloud computing;Real-time systems;Process control;Smart manufacturing","","3","","22","IEEE","23 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the Siemens NX MCD software tool is used to develop the virtual commissioning digital twin model for the system. Then the different working scenarios are simulated and implemented in the virtual physical simulation environment. The data from the proposed virtual commissioning digital twin model is collected and trained with 6 different machine learning algorithm such as Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The advantage of our newly developed virtual commissioning model is that it is able to simulate different working conditions without risk and cost-free. It is also convenient to mimic the worsening working status and failed operation scenarios which need long time to collect for the real system.

These predictions can then be compared to the observed values, here the sensor data collected from the aircraft during flight. If the observed value is far from the predicted value, a failure warning is raised and a maintenance action shall be performed.In this paper, we build a digital twin of the electrical generator which predicts the oil generator temperature at a given time thanks to the history of features.

To tackle the first challenge, we apply data balancing techniques to experimental datasets. To tackle the second challenge, we propose an algorithm for the multitask model to learn from missing (incomplete) labels. This algorithm has two steps. We first train a teacher model to perform all three tasks, where each instance is trained by the ground truth label of its corresponding task. Secondly, we refer to the outputs of the teacher model as the soft labels. We use the soft labels and the ground truth to train the student model.

In principle, solutions must be developed that enable comprehensive networking and barrier-free data exchange to support the numerous new application scenarios [2]. Nowadays, in a typical smart home, there exist a large number of miscellaneous devices and systems with different characteristics. Using their sensors and actuators, these devices and systems can form an interface to the real world and can make their measurements available in near real time. Furthermore, it is possible to provide a digital representation of an entire Smart Home or Building using a socalled Digital Twin. Digital Twins can not only represent the current state of the underlying systems, but also the history of the data for learning processes in a semantic context. Hence, they can provide interfaces to AI systems in a service environment. In this paper, we present an approach which uses the WoT Thing Description (TD) as standardized by the W3C [3] as the basis for the implementation of a novel Digital Twin for Smart Homes and Buildings. The use of the standardized TD model enables interoperability across manufacturers and devices. The goal is to make extended services more flexible and dynamic on the basis of semantic device type and building descriptions of Digital Twins.","","978-1-7281-8491-3","10.1109/CANDO-EPE51100.2020.9337749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9337749","Digital Twin;Cyber-Physical System;Web of Things;Semantic Web","Smart buildings;Digital twin;Semantics;W3C;Smart homes;Time measurement;Sensor systems","","3","","26","IEEE","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for search relevance prediction, by distilling knowledge from BERT and related multi-layer Transformer teacher models into simple feed-forward networks with large amount of unlabeled data. The distillation process produces a student model that recovers more than 97% test accuracy of teacher models on new queries, at a serving cost that's several magnitude lower (latency 150x lower than BERT-Base and 15x lower than the most efficient BERT variant, TinyBERT). The applications of temperature rescaling and teacher model stacking further boost model accuracy, without increasing the student model complexity. We present experimental results on both in-house e-commerce search relevance data as well as a public data set on sentiment analysis from the GLUE benchmark. The latter takes advantage of another related public data set of much larger scale, while disregarding its potentially noisy labels. Embedding analysis and case study on the in-house data further highlight the strength of the resulting model. By making the data processing and model training source code public, we hope the techniques presented here can help reduce energy consumption of the state of the art Transformer models and also level the playing field for small organizations lacking access to cutting edge machine learning hardwares.","2374-8486","978-1-7281-8316-9","10.1109/ICDM50108.2020.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9338302","transfer learning;knowledge distillation;ensemble learning","Training;Analytical models;Temperature distribution;Bit error rate;Machine learning;Data models;User experience","","2","","30","IEEE","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, publishing those models trained on sensitive datasets, such as medical records, could pose serious privacy concerns. To counter these issues, one of the current state-of-the-art approaches is Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles, or PATE, which achieved promising results in preserving the utility of the model while providing a strong privacy guarantee. PATE combines an ensemble of ""teacher models"" trained on sensitive data and transfers the knowledge to a ""student"" model through the noisy aggregation of teachers' votes for labeling unlabeled public data which the student model will be trained on. However, the knowledge or voted labels learned by the student are noisy due to private aggregation. Learning directly from noisy labels can significantly impact the accuracy of the student model. In this paper, we propose the PATE++ mechanism, which combines the current advanced noisy label training mechanisms co-teaching(+) with the original PATE framework to enhance its accuracy. A novel structure of Generative Adversarial Nets with one generator and two discriminators is developed in order to integrate them effectively. Furthermore, we discuss the intrinsic limitations of the ""update-by-disagreement"" method in the co-teaching+ mechanism and develop a novel noisy label detection mechanism for semi-supervised model training to further improve student model performance when training with noisy labels. We evaluate our method on Fashion-MNIST and SVHN to show the improvements on the original PATE on all measures.","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378234","National Science Foundation; National Institutes of Health; Air Force Office of Scientific Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9378234","Differential Privacy;Deep Learning;Noisy Labels","Training;Data privacy;Privacy;Big Data;Data models;Noise measurement;Task analysis","","2","","31","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally, the student is trained by a high-capacity teacher (model) whose training is resource-intensive. The student trained this way is suboptimal because it is difficult to learn the real data distribution from the teacher. To address this issue, we propose to train the student against a discriminator in a minimax game. Such a minimax game has an issue that it can take an excessively long time for the training to converge. To address this issue, we propose adversarial distillation consisting of a student, a teacher, and a discriminator. The discriminator is now a multi-class classifier that distinguishes among the real data, the student, and the teacher. The student and the teacher aim to fool the discriminator via adversarial losses, while they learn from each other via distillation losses. By optimizing the adversarial and the distillation losses simultaneously, the student and the teacher can learn the real data distribution. To accelerate the training, we propose to obtain low-variance gradient updates from the discriminator using a Gumbel-Softmax trick. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed adversarial distillation under both accuracy and training speed.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2942592","Australian Research Council Future Fellowship(grant numbers:FT120100832); Discovery Project(grant numbers:DP180102050); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8845633","Adversarial distillation;generative adversarial network;knowledge distillation;privileged information","Training;Task analysis;Generators;Gallium nitride;Computational modeling;Games;Lakes","","4","","53","IEEE","20 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a teacher-student learning paradigm to compress the 3D point cloud map. Specifically, we first find a subset of LiDAR points with high number of observations to preserve the localization performance, which is regarded as the teacher of map compression. An efficient optimization strategy is proposed to deal with the massive data in original map. With the supervision of compressed map, a student model is built by training a random forest model fed with geometric feature descriptors of each point. As a result, the student model is able to compress the map without referring to the expensive numerical optimization. Additionally, by incorporating the features, the innovative student model can be generalized to other new maps while no re-training is required. We conduct thorough experiments on multi-session dataset and KITTI dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed learning paradigm, and the comparison with other map compression methods. The final results show that the learned student model can achieve efficient map compression with comparable LiDAR based localization performance to the original map at the same time.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2019.2961120","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1309300); National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1609210,61903332); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949733","LiDAR based localization;map compression;teacher-student learning paradigm","Three-dimensional displays;Laser radar;Optimization;Programming;Solid modeling;Analytical models;Image coding","","16","","43","IEEE","3 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The master network combines the knowledge of the student and teacher models with additional access to newly discovered samples. The master and teacher models are then used to guide the training of the student network by enforcing the consistency between their predictions of unlabeled samples and evolve all models when more and more samples are discovered. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the process of discovering confident samples from the unlabeled dataset, once coupled with the master-teacher-student network evolution, can significantly improve the overall semi-supervised learning performance.

To utilize the unlabeled data, our method encourages consistent predictions of the network-in-training for the same input under different perturbations.

To this end, we propose a cutting-edge semi-supervised domain adaptation framework, namely Dual-Teacher++. Besides directly learning from limited labeled target domain data (e.g., CT) via a student model adopted by previous literature, we design novel dual teacher models, including an inter-domain teacher model to explore cross-modality priors from source domain (e.g., MR) and an intra-domain teacher model to investigate the knowledge beneath unlabeled target domain. In this way, the dual teacher models would transfer acquired inter- and intra-domain knowledge to the student model for further integration and exploitation. Moreover, to encourag reliable dual-domain knowledge transfer, we enhance the inter-domain knowledge transfer on the samples with higher similarity to target domain after appearance alignment, and also strengthen intra-domain knowledge transfer of unlabeled target data with higher prediction confidence. In this way, the student model can obtain reliable dual-domain knowledge and yield improved performance on target domain data.

Training efficient deep neural networks on much smaller sets of labeled samples is a challenging problem. With a small labeled set, the initial network suffers from low accuracy. Based on this error-prone network, the subsequent semi-supervised learning process will be fragile and unstable. To address this issue, we propose to introduce a look-ahead master model to identify the correct direction of model evolution to effectively guide the semi-supervised learning process of the student model. Specifically, our proposed LMCS method explores two major ideas. First, it introduces a new learned model composition structure so that we can compose a more efficient master network from student models of past iterations through a network learning process. Second, we develop a new method, called confined maximum entropy search, to discover new critical samples near the model decision boundary and provide the master model with look-ahead access to these samples to enhance its guidance capability. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LMCS method outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods, especially on small sets of labeled samples.

Nevertheless, the complex and coherent characteristics of the intelligent cooperation of UAV swarm greatly restrict its wide application. The recent development of artificial intelligence provides new methodologies for intelligent cooperation of UAV swarm. However, these methods are resource-in-tensive that cannot be directly applied in the computation and storage constrained UAVs. In this article, we propose a novel digital twin (DT)-based intelligent cooperation framework of UAV swarm. In the framework, a digital twin model is established to reflect the physical entity (i.e., UAV swarm) with high-fidelity and monitors its whole life cycle. Next, the decision model that integrates a machine learning algorithm is built to explore the global optimal solution and controls the behaviors of UAV swarm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, a case study on intelligent network reconstruction is introduced, and simulation results are presented. Finally, a representative application provided by the framework is discussed.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000388","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572254,61902182); Aeronautical Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2016ZC52029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9263396","","Data models;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Integrated circuit modeling;Digital twin;Computational modeling;Machine learning algorithms;Real-time systems","","46","","15","IEEE","18 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This human-robot interaction (HRI) working style helps to enhance human users' operational productivity and comfort; while data-driven welder behavior analysis benefits to further novice welder training. This HRI system includes three modules: 1) a human user who demonstrates the welding operations offsite with her/his operations recorded by the motion-tracked handles; 2) a robot that executes the demonstrated welding operations to complete the physical welding tasks onsite; 3) a DT system that is developed based on virtual reality (VR) as a digital replica of the physical human-robot interactive welding environment. The DT system bridges a human user and robot through a bi-directional information flow: a) transmitting demonstrated welding operations in VR to the robot in the physical environment; b) displaying the physical welding scenes to human users in VR. Compared to existing DT systems reported in the literatures, the developed one provides better capability in engaging human users in interacting with welding scenes, through an augmented VR. To verify the effectiveness, six welders, skilled with certain manual welding training and unskilled without any training, tested the system by completing the same welding job; three skilled welders produce satisfied welded workpieces, while the other three unskilled do not. A data-driven approach as a combination of fast Fourier transform (FFT), principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector machine (SVM) is developed to analyze their behaviors. Given an operation sequence, i.e., motion speed sequence of the welding torch, frequency features are firstly extracted by FFT and then reduced in dimension through PCA, which are finally routed into SVM for classification. The trained model demonstrates a 94.44% classification accuracy in the testing dataset. The successful pattern recognition in skilled welder operations should benefit to accelerate novice welder training.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2020.1003518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9269521","Digital twin (DT);human-robot interaction (HRI);machine learning;virtual reality (VR);welder behavior analysis","Welding;Robots;Digital twin;Three-dimensional displays;Task analysis;Optimization;Monitoring","","80","","42","","24 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we propose a novel learning scheme for training a lightweight ship detector called Tiny YOLO-Lite, which simultaneously 1) reduces the model storage size; 2) decreases the floating point operations (FLOPs) calculation; and 3) guarantees the high accuracy with faster speed. This is achieved by self-designed backbone structure and network pruning, which enforces channel-level sparsity in the backbone network and yields a compact model. In addition, knowledge distillation is also applied to make up for the performance decline caused by network pruning. Hereinto, we propose to let small student model mimic cumbersome teacher's output to achieve improved generalization. Rather than applying vanilla full feature imitation, we redefine the distilled knowledge as the inter-relationship between different levels of feature maps and then transfer it from the large network to a smaller one. On account that the detectors should focus more on the salient regions containing ships while background interference is overwhelming, a novel attention mechanism is designed and then attached to the distilled feature for enhanced representation. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on SSDD, HRSID, and two large-scene SAR images to verify the effectiveness of the thinner SAR ship object detector in comparison of with other CNN-based algorithms. The detection results demonstrate that the proposed detector can achieve lighter architecture with 2.8-M model size, more efficient inference (>200 fps) with low computation cost, and more accurate prediction with knowledge transfer strategy.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3041783","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901500); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2020JJ5674); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9285261","Attention mechanism;feature imitation;knowledge distillation (KD);lightweight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship detector;network pruning","Detectors;Marine vehicles;Feature extraction;Computational modeling;Synthetic aperture radar;Knowledge engineering;Object detection","","53","","52","CCBY","7 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It involves these organisations having to support several different approaches to aircraft health management, and is therefore inefficient and costly. In the current work, a streamlined methodology is put forward. This is based on OSA-CBM (Open System Architecture for Condition Based Maintenance) and can be applied to any aircraft system. Integral with this is the use of mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) for feature selection, the resulting symptom vector being used for fault diagnosis. This approach is demonstrated on three test cases: the engine, the environmental control system, and the fuel system. In each case, the digital twin setup, simulation conditions for healthy and faulty scenarios, a methodology based on OSA-CBM up to diagnostics are detailed. Diagnostics is carried out for each system in turn, using four machine learning supervised algorithms.

Accordingly, an electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rhythms classifier model was built using machine learning to diagnose heart disease and detect heart problems. The implemented models successfully predicted a particular heart condition with high accuracy in different algorithms. The collected results have shown that integrating DT with the healthcare field would improve healthcare processes by bringing patients and healthcare professionals together in an intelligent, comprehensive, and scalable health ecosystem.

It has been shown to have a range of potential benefits, for instance in reducing waste and logistics costs. Increased uptake of urban farming can even relieve pressure on the natural environment by reducing the burden of production required from farmland by creating space for it to recover from accumulated damage as a result of the use of unsustainable farming practices historically. This article describes an approach for a new type of decision support system suitable for urban farming production. We discuss differences between the requirements and the users of decision support in urban agriculture, and those of ordinary agribusiness enterprises. A case study is performed using a novel technology for urban farming: a cyber-physical implementation of aquaponics is enhanced with adaptive capabilities using a digital twin system and machine learning. Aquaponics is a farming technique that utilizes a harmonious nutrient exchange cycle for growing plants and fish together, while conserving water, and possibly without the need for soil or even sunlight. Empirical results are provided that evaluate the use of data driven decision analytics and a digital twin model to plan production from the aquaponic system during a three month trial.

The framework is applied to assess radiation dose to radiosensitive organs in CT imaging of individual patients. Method: Given a volume of patient CT images, iPhantom segments selected anchor organs and structures (e.g., liver, bones, pancreas) using a learning-based model developed for multi-organ CT segmentation. Organs which are challenging to segment (e.g., intestines) are incorporated from a matched phantom template, using a diffeomorphic registration model developed for multi-organ phantom-voxels. The resulting digital-twin phantoms are used to assess organ doses during routine CT exams. Result: iPhantom was validated on both with a set of XCAT digital phantoms (n = 50) and an independent clinical dataset (n = 10) with similar accuracy. iPhantom precisely predicted all organ locations yielding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) 0.6 - 1 for anchor organs and DSC of 0.3-0.9 for all other organs. iPhantom showed <; 10% errors in estimated radiation dose for the majority of organs, which was notably superior to the state-of-the-art baseline method (20-35% dose errors). Conclusion: iPhantom enables automated and accurate creation of patient-specific phantoms and, for the first time, provides sufficient and automated patient-specific dose estimates for CT dosimetry. Significance: The new framework brings the creation and application of CHPs (computational human phantoms) to the level of individual CHPs through automation, achieving wide and precise organ localization, paving the way for clinical monitoring, personalized optimization, and large-scale research.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2021.3063080","National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01EB001838); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9366802","Computational phantoms;organ dose;CT;segmentation;deformable registration","Phantoms;Biological systems;Computed tomography;Image segmentation;Biomedical imaging;Training;Laboratories","Humans;Phantoms, Imaging;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","11","","36","IEEE","2 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, KD is seldom applicable to an environment where it is difficult or impossible to access training data. To solve this problem, a complete zero-shot KD (C-ZSKD) based on adversarial learning has been recently proposed, but the so-called biased sample generation problem limits the performance of C-ZSKD. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a novel C-ZSKD algorithm that utilizes a label-free adversarial perturbation. The proposed adversarial perturbation derives a constraint of the squared norm of gradient style by using the convolution of probability distributions and the 2nd order Taylor series approximation. The constraint serves to increase the variance of the adversarial sample distribution, which makes the student model learn the decision boundary of the teacher model more accurately without labeled data. Through analysis of the distribution of adversarial samples on the embedded space, this paper also provides an insight into the characteristics of adversarial samples that are effective for adversarial learning-based C-ZSKD.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3066513","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) Grant by the Korean Government through the Ministry of Science and Information & Communications Technology (MSIT); Artificial Intelligence Convergence Research Center, Inha University(grant numbers:2020-0-01389); Engineering Development Research Center (EDRC) through the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy (MOTIE)(grant numbers:P0008475); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9380328","Zero-shot learning;knowledge distillation;adversarial learning","Perturbation methods;Training data;Training;Probability distribution;Generators;Neural networks;Convolution","","2","","25","CCBY","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in this paper, we demonstrate that existing image-level refinement with a stage-independent learning design is problematic with the side effect of over/under-deraining. To resolve this issue, we for the first time propose the mechanism of learning to carry out refinement on the unsatisfactory features, and propose a novel attentive feature refinement (AFR) module. Specifically, AFR is designed as a two-branched network for simultaneous rain-distribution-aware attention map learning and attention guided hierarchy-preserving feature refinement. Guided by task-specific attention, coarse features are progressively refined to better model the diversified rainy effects. By using a separable convolution as the basic component, our AFR module introduces little computation overhead and can be readily integrated into most rainy-to-clean image translation networks for achieving better deraining results. By incorporating a series of AFR modules into a general encoder-decoder network, AFR-Net is constructed for deraining and it achieves new state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real images. Furthermore, by using AFR-Net as a teacher model, we explore the use of knowledge distillation to successfully learn a student model that is also able to achieve state-of-the-art results but with a much faster inference speed (i.e., it only takes 0.08 second to process a 512×512 rainy image).

Meanwhile, current 3-D simulation-based robotic platforms do not model the dynamics of the physical world on-the-fly as done in DT systems, limiting their potential for the development of robotics in challenging environments. To tackle this issue, we propose the first robot-centered smart DT framework, namely, Terra, to facilitate the deployment of robots in challenging environments. The proposed Terra framework introduces a comprehensive DT representation to encode the useful real-time dynamics of both the physical world and the robot agent deployed therein. A multiview multimodality perception module is further devised for Terra to obtain high-level semantics and deliver a precise description of the current status of the environment and the robot agent. By mapping the perceived results to the virtual replica of the physical environment, Terra actively updates the action policy and sends it back to the agent, forming an integral and real-time information feedback loop. In practice, to help demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework, we deliberately set up a challenging unordered physical environment with many obstacles and a very simple robot aiming to fulfill a navigation task. Empirical results show that the proposed Terra framework successfully facilitates the robot to accomplish the task without causing hazards.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3068736","Australian Research Council Projects(grant numbers:FL-170100117,IH-180100002,IC-190100031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9386242","Artificial intelligence;deep learning;digital twin (DT);object detection;pose estimation;robot;simulation","Robots;Robot sensing systems;Three-dimensional displays;Real-time systems;Task analysis;Data models;Solid modeling","","13","","66","IEEE","25 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since human operators hold some objects for conducting tasks, there are many constrained situations where they cannot use their hands for HRI interactions. To provide more effective and intuitive task assistance, the proposed hands-free method supports coarse-to-fine interactions. Eye gazing-based interaction is used for coarse interactions such as searching and previewing of target objects, and head gesture interactions are used for fine interactions such as selection and 3D manipulation. In addition, deep learning-based object detection is applied to estimate the initial positioning of physical objects to be manipulated by the robot. The result of object detection is then combined with 3D spatial mapping in the MR environment for supporting accurate initial object positioning. Furthermore, virtual object-based indirect manipulation is proposed to support more intuitive and efficient control of the robot, compared with traditional direct manipulation (e.g., joint-based and end effector-based manipulations). In particular, a digital twin, the synchronized virtual robot of the real robot, is used to provide a preview and simulation of the real robot to manipulate it more effectively and accurately. Two case studies were conducted to confirm the originality and advantages of the proposed hands-free HRI: (1) performance evaluation of initial object positioning and (2) comparative analysis with traditional direct robot manipulations. The deep learning-based initial positioning reduces much effort for robot manipulation using eye gazing and head gestures. The object-based indirect manipulation also supports more effective HRI than previous direct interaction methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3071364","Republic of Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) through the High-Potential Individuals Global Training Program supervised by the Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP)(grant numbers:2020-0-01532); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education through the Basic Science Research Program(grant numbers:2019R1I1A3A01059082); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395580","Deep learning;eye gazing;hands-free interaction;head gestures;human–robot interaction;mixed reality;object detection","Robots;Task analysis;Three-dimensional displays;Virtual reality;Service robots;Object detection;Deep learning","","41","","48","CCBYNCND","6 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite their remarkable performance improvements, end-to-end models typically require expensive computational cost to show successful performance. To reduce this computational burden, knowledge distillation (KD), which is a popular model compression method, has been used to transfer knowledge from a deep and complex model (teacher) to a shallower and simpler model (student). Previous KD approaches have commonly designed the architecture of the student by reducing the width per layer or the number of layers of the teacher. This structural reduction scheme might limit the flexibility of model selection since the student model structure should be similar to that of the given teacher. To cope with this limitation, we propose a KD method for end-to-end speech recognition, namely TutorNet, that applies KD techniques across different types of neural networks at the hidden representation-level as well as the output-level. For concrete realizations, we firstly apply representation-level knowledge distillation (RKD) during the initialization step, and then apply the softmax-level knowledge distillation (SKD) combined with the original task learning. When the student is trained with RKD, we make use of frame weighting that points out the frames to which the teacher pays more attention. Through a number of experiments, it is verified that TutorNet not only distills the knowledge between networks with different topologies but also significantly contributes to improving the performance of the distilled student.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2021.3071662","Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd.(grant numbers:IO201211-08075-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9398543","Speech recognition;connectionist temporal classification;knowledge distillation;teacher-student learning;transfer learning","Computational modeling;Hidden Markov models;Speech recognition;Training;Knowledge engineering;Speech processing;Task analysis","","10","","47","IEEE","7 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional supervised VAD systems obtain frame-level labels from an ASR pipeline by using, e.g., a Hidden Markov model. These ASR models are commonly trained on clean and fully transcribed data, limiting VAD systems to be trained on clean or synthetically noised datasets. Therefore, a major challenge for supervised VAD systems is their generalization towards noisy, real-world data. This work proposes a data-driven teacher-student approach for VAD, which utilizes vast and unconstrained audio data for training. Unlike previous approaches, only weak labels during teacher training are required, enabling the utilization of any real-world, potentially noisy dataset. Our approach firstly trains a teacher model on a source dataset (Audioset) using clip-level supervision. After training, the teacher provides frame-level guidance to a student model on an unlabeled, target dataset. A multitude of student models trained on mid- to large-sized datasets are investigated (Audioset, Voxceleb, NIST SRE). Our approach is then respectively evaluated on clean, artificially noised, and real-world data. We observe significant performance gains in artificially noised and real-world scenarios.

As the knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 evolve, an appropriate response plan for this pandemic is considered one of the most effective methods for controlling the spread of the virus. Recent studies indicate that a city Digital Twin (DT) is beneficial for tackling this health crisis, because it can construct a virtual replica to simulate factors, such as climate conditions, response policies, and people's trajectories, to help plan efficient and inclusive decisions. However, a city DTsystem relies on long-term and high-quality data collection to make appropriate decisions, limiting its advantages when facing urgent crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Federated Learning (FL), in which all clients can learn a shared model while retaining all training data locally, emerges as a promising solution for accumulating the insights from multiple data sources efficiently Furthermore, the enhanced privacy protection settings removing the privacy barriers lie in this collaboration. In this work, we propose a framework that fused city DT with FL to achieve a novel collaborative paradigm that allows multiple city DTs to share the local strategy and status quickly. In particular, an FL central server manages the local updates of multiple collaborators (city DTs), providing a global model that is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems until the model gains the correlations between various response plans and infection trends. This approach means a collaborative city DT paradigm fused with FL techniques can obtain knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs and eventually establish a ""global view"" of city crisis management. Meanwhile, it also helps improve each city's DT by consolidating other DT's data without violating privacy rules. In this paper, we use the COVID-19 pandemic as the use case of the proposed framework. The experimental results on a real dataset with various response plans validate our proposed solution and demonstrate its superior performance.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9409764","COVID-19;Digital Twin (DT);Federated Learning (FL);deep learning","Urban areas;COVID-19;Data models;Collaboration;Predictive models;Pandemics;Training","","95","","","","20 Apr 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In this article, a single conjugate heat transfer analysis provides the possibility to accurately predict thermal performances by incorporating both computational fluid dynamic and heat transfer modules. Then, the developed model is used as the basis for deriving a fast reduced-order model of the traction motor enabling prediction of motor thermal behavior in duty cycles with a high number of operating points. All the results achieved are verified using flow and temperature measurements carried out on a traction motor designed and built for a traction application. A good agreement between the measured and estimated values of flows and temperatures is achieved while keeping the computation time within a reasonable range for both the full-order and reduced-order conjugate heat transfer models.

However, there are two major problems with existing knowledge distillation methods. One is the teacher's supervision is sometimes misleading, and the other is the student's prediction is not accurate enough. To address the first issue, instead of learning a combination of both teachers and ground truth, we apply knowledge adjustment to correct teachers' supervision using ground truth. For the second problem, we use the selective classification framework to train the student model. In particular, the deep gambler loss is adopted to predict with reservation by explicitly introducing the ($m+1$)-th class. We consider two settings of knowledge distillation: (1) distillation across different network structures (AlexNet, ResNet), and (2) distillation across networks with different depths (ResNet18, ResNet5 0) to evaluate the effectiveness of our method.

The reinforcement learning (RL) approach is well suited to this type of problem since it is a methodology for planning; RL finds the optimal strategy as that which maximizes future expected profit. The purpose of this study is to clarify the effects of intervention based on RL to support healthy daily life. Therefore, we (i) collect real daily activity data from participants, (ii) generate a user model that imitates the user's response to system interventions, (iii) examine valuable goals and design them as rewards in RL and (iv) obtain optimal intervention strategies by RL via simulations given a user model and goals.

MT maintains a teacher model's weights as the exponential moving average of a student model's weights and minimizes the divergence between their probability predictions under diverse perturbations of the inputs. However, MT is known to suffer from confirmation bias, that is, reinforcing incorrect teacher model predictions. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method called Local Clustering (LC) to mitigate the effect of confirmation bias. In MT, each data point is considered independent of other points during training; however, data points are likely to be close to each other in feature space if they share similar features. Motivated by this, we cluster data points locally by minimizing the pairwise distance between neighboring data points in feature space. Combined with a standard classification cross-entropy objective on labeled data points, the misclassified unlabeled data points are pulled towards high-density regions of their correct class with the help of their neighbors, thus improving model performance. We demonstrate on semi-supervised benchmark datasets SVHN and CIFAR-10 that adding our LC loss to MT yields significant improvements compared to MT and performance comparable to the state of the art in semi-supervised learning11The code is available at: https://github.com/jay1204/local_clustering_with_mt_for_ssl.","1051-4651","978-1-7281-8808-9","10.1109/ICPR48806.2021.9412469","NSF(grant numbers:IIS-1909644); ARO(grant numbers:W911NF1810295); NSF(grant numbers:IIS-1822477); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9412469","","Training;Perturbation methods;Predictive models;Benchmark testing;Semisupervised learning;Data models;Pattern recognition","","","","34","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, a system is needed that allows students who are enrolled in remote courses to experience hardware-intensive classes just as they would an in-person course (especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic). In this work, use virtual and augmented reality to build and test a remote UR-10 robotics lab that allows students to work together on a hands-on robotics-based lab. In the future, we plan to demonstrate its technical and pedagogical suitability by running a user study in a real-world class whereby remote students enrolled in a course will participate in a series of experiments to control a UR-10 robot arm. It opens up avenues to explore the advantages and shortcomings of running coordinated group lab exercises between students from different institutions, time-zones, and continents by time-decoupling the schedules.

However, these methods are inadaptive to the dynamic changes of high-dimensional network states, thus the result is often suboptimal. Reinforcement learning can better cope with high-dimensional network state space and parameter space. However, when applied to real network, challenges arise such as difficult to obtain data samples, time-consuming and risky to explore real networks during model training. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a combined approach of expert knowledge, reinforcement learning and digital twin for the self-optimization of mobile networks. By constructing a digital twin of the current network, the future network state is predicted based on which optimization decisions are generated by expert knowledge and reinforcement learning respectively, and then input into the digital twin. Digital twin simulates their rewards and decides a final action for execution. Simulation results have confirmed that the proposed scheme can achieve higher rewards than either expert knowledge or reinforcement learning, and can avoid negative impact on real network performance. This paper also describes several potential application scenarios for the proposed approach in 6G networks and discusses key issues for future research.","","978-1-7281-9507-0","10.1109/WCNCW49093.2021.9420037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9420037","mobile network self-optimization;digital twinning;reinforcement learning","Knowledge engineering;Training;6G mobile communication;Machine learning algorithms;Digital twin;Conferences;Simulation","","24","","14","IEEE","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By inserting this module after the convolutional layer, each neuron can adaptively adjust its receptive field to suit different sound events. Secondly, instead of using the teacher model to provide a consistency cost term, we propose using a stochastic inference of unlabeled examples to generate high quality pseudo-targets by averaging multiple predictions from the perturbed student model. MixUp of both labeled and unlabeled data is further exploited to improve the effectiveness of student model. Finally, the teacher model can be obtained via exponential moving average (EMA) of the student model, which generates final predictions for SED during inference.

Thus, it is important to detect such anomalies. Detecting such anomalies is challenging since it is uncertain when and where anomalies can happen. To this end, we present a novel approach called Anomaly deTection with digiTAl twIN (ATTAIN), which continuously and automatically builds a digital twin with live data obtained from a CPS for anomaly detection. ATTAIN builds a Timed Automaton Machine (TAM) as the digital representation of the CPS, and implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to detect anomalies. GAN uses a GCN-LSTM-based module as a generator, which can capture temporal and spatial characteristics of the input data and learn to produce realistic unlabeled adversarial samples. TAM labels these adversarial samples, which are then fed into a discriminator along with real labeled samples. After training, the discriminator is capable of distinguishing anomalous data from normal data with a high F1 score. To evaluate our approach, we used three publicly available datasets collected from three CPS testbeds. Evaluation results show that ATTAIN improved the performance of two state-of-art anomaly detection methods by 2.413%, 8.487%, and 5.438% on average on the three datasets, respectively.

Modelling of user behavior is a prerequisite for predicting the building energy consumption. It offers a possibility to adapt the building operation to best suit the user requirements while achieving minimal energy consumption through room air conditioning. This paper presents a deep learning model for prediction of an individual room temperature setpoint provided by the user. Model learning is conducted on the available dataset consisting of external weather and internal climate measurements. External weather conditions include the air temperature, relative humidity and direct, diffuse and global solar irradiation. The internal conditions refer to four offices for which the air temperature, the mode of operation of the fan coil controller and the temperature setpoints are available. The model is based on a neural network with Long Short-Term Memory. The highest accuracy is achieved with the model developed for the inputs of historical setpoints, system operation, day of the week and relative humidity.

In this study, we further investigate the effect of adding noise in the knowledge distillation framework because of its resemblance to collaborative subnetworks in the brain regions. We empirically show that injecting constructive noise at different levels in the collaborative learning framework enables us to train the model effectively and distill desirable characteristics in the student model. In doing so, we propose three different methods that target the common challenges in deep neural networks: minimizing the performance gap between a compact model and large model (Fickle Teacher), training high performance compact adversarially robust models (Soft Randomization), and training models efficiently under label noise (Messy Collaboration).

Due the critical nature of the power grid, the ability to detect anomalies in the power grid is of critical importance to prevent power outages, avoid damage to sensitive equipment and to maintain a working power grid. Over the past few decades, the modern power grid has evolved into a large Cyber Physical System (CPS) equipped with wide area monitoring systems (WAMS) and distributed control. As smart technology advances, the power grid continues to be upgraded with high fidelity sensors and measurement devices, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs), that can report the state of the system with a high temporal resolution. However, this influx of data can often become overwhelming to the legacy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, as well as, the power system operator. In this paper, we propose using a deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) as a module within the Automatic Network Guardian for ELectrical systems (ANGEL) Digital Twin environment to detect physical faults in a power system. The presented approach uses high fidelity measurement data from the IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 39-bus benchmark power systems to not only detect if there is a fault in the power system but also applies the algorithm to classify which bus contains the fault.","","978-1-7281-8192-9","10.1109/NAPS50074.2021.9449682","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-18-1-2396); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9449682","Deep Learning;Convolutional Neural Network;Digital Twin;Smart Grid;Cyber Physical System;Wide Area Monitoring System;Anomaly Detection;Fault Detection","Deep learning;Power measurement;Digital twin;SCADA systems;Power grids;Phasor measurement units;Sensor systems","","23","","36","IEEE","21 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This concept is especially relevant for Commercial Aerospace Industry (CAI) OEMs, whose business models rely heavily on high-quality service delivery, and learning about the status of each individual product could translate to cost savings of the order of millions of dollars. However, while extensive debate has taken place about the specifications of a complete, idealized DT, there is comparatively little discussion about the process and key decisions necessary for implementing such concept. This makes it difficult for managers and executives to devise strategies for implementing their DTs, as well as understanding where improvement is needed or where a competitive advantage exists. This work seeks to alleviate that gap through the development of a 10-dimension maturity model for DT implementations in CAI OEMs. Using a design science research methodology, the dimensions and their corresponding maturity levels are derived systematically. A novel framework for the derivation of maturity dimensions is presented as well. The maturity model will be helpful to industry practitioners in CAI OEMs who are seeking to benchmark their own DTs or develop an implementation strategy. For academics, this maturity model advances discussions about contextual DT implementation processes. Finally, a contribution is made to the maturity model development literature through the proposed maturity dimension derivation framework.","","978-1-6654-3585-7","10.1109/ICITM52822.2021.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9459273","digital twin;maturity;implementation;digital twin implementation;digital technology implementation","Industries;Analytical models;Digital twin;Design methodology;Computational modeling;Benchmark testing;Tools","","6","","51","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Properly adapting the configuration of CPPSs then relies on the expertise of human operators. Digital Twins (DTs) that reify this expertise and learn from it to address unforeseen challenges can significantly facilitate self-adaptive manufacturing where experience is very specific and, hence, insufficient to employ deep learning techniques. We leverage the explicit modeling of domain expertise through case-based reasoning to improve the capabilities of Digital Twins for adapting to such situations. To this effect, we present a modeling framework for self-adaptive manufacturing that supports modeling domain-specific cases, describing rules for case similarity and case-based reasoning within a modular Digital Twin.

Thus we propose a novel Gray Box-based approach namely Deep Reinforcement Learning-enabled Constraint Set Inversion Algorithm (DRESIA), which establishes a quantitative model of the nonlinear interoperability effects of system internal states which simplifies the White Box's complex mechanism of reconstruction and prediction and retains the interpretability of the model, therefore improves the prediction efficiency of feasible region while also improving the generalization ability.

Under the premise that the large-scale 5G Cyber-Twin system satisfies the given Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, we perform DRESIA to realize the efficient and dynamic optimal search of feasible region, the results show that the DRESIA reduces the computational cost, and balances the accuracy and robustness of the feasible region, which validate the effectiveness and superiority of Gray Box-based approach.","2644-1268","","10.1109/OJCS.2021.3097540","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB2104300); National Natural Science Foundation of China Key Project Program(grant numbers:61932014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488228","Cyber-twin;digital twin;dynamic system;white-box;black-box;gray-box;fuzzy measure;choquet integral;deep reinforcement learning;feasible region inversion;massive MIMO","Graphics;Image color analysis;Magnetic separation;Magnetization;Magnetostatics;Magnetic resonance imaging;Reinforcement learning;Deep learning","","7","","46","CCBY","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper analyses the effects of Digital Twin deployment strategies on the effectiveness of predictive maintenance activities relying on distributed collaborative prognosis. Distributed and heterarchical multi-agent system architectures are analysed for large fleets of assets, with varying failure rates and noise levels in the failure data.

Of all the different ways leading to this transformation, both the generation of virtual replicas of processes and applying artificial intelligence (AI) techniques provide a wide range of possibilities whose exploration is today a far from negligible sources of opportunities to increase industrial companies' competitiveness.

This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3100708","Experiment Enabling Security with Digital Twin Units (ELEGANT) in the 7th Open Call of the Fed4FIRE+ Project through the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:732638); European Commission; Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9499077","Digital Twins;SCADA;pipelines;security;programmable logic controllers;DTaaS","Security;Digital twin;Monitoring;Integrated circuits;Process control;SCADA systems;Analytical models","","15","","52","CCBY","27 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It can be used to run simulations before manufacturing. However, traditional DT platforms lack data privacy, traceability, immutability, authentication of stakeholders. Moreover, manual prediction of the wearing of the tool condition of the CNC machine is challenging. Motivated from these gaps, in this paper, we propose a six-layered architecture for DT of CNC, which predicts CNC tool wear detection using a novel ensemble technique based soft voted prediction model consisting of XGBoost, random forest, and AdaBoost models. The proposed architecture also incorporates the public Ethereum blockchain (BC) to maintain the aforementioned issues of authentication, traceability, and transparency through constraints and automation programmed into the smart contracts (SC) developed. We evaluate the proposed scheme’s performance through simulation and compare it with other traditional approaches concerning several performance parameters (accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall).

Multi-task learning aims to learn the general meta-knowledge via sharing inductive bias for improving generalization ability. However, there exists a negative transfer problem in MTL, in which the performance improvement of a specific task leads to performance degradation of other tasks. Multi-task learning is essentially a multi-objective problem because of the task competition, necessitating a trade-off in individual optimality. Inspired by knowledge distillation, a set of task-specific teacher models can transfer the knowledge to a student multi-task model, without signicifantly loss in performance. In other words, the individual optimality can be achieved via multi-teacher knowledge distillation, where each teacher model is optimal and contains sufficient general meta-knowledge. Therefore, we propose multi-task distillation to couple with the negative transfer, turning the multi-objective optimization problem into a multi-teacher knowledge distillation problem. In detail, we firstly collect the optimal task-specific teacher models, and then achieve the individual optimality of the student model by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiment results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over current state-of-the-art multi-task learning formulations and single-task training.","2381-8549","978-1-6654-4115-5","10.1109/ICIP42928.2021.9506618","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9506618","Multi-task Learning;Knowledge Distillation;Negative Transfer;Multi-objective optimization","Training;Degradation;Image processing;Conferences;Optimization methods;Benchmark testing;Turning","","3","","17","IEEE","23 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, considering the limited number of annotated cephalometric data, we believe the performance can be better improved by better utilizing ground-truth information. In this paper, we propose a teacher-student learning method using GT images for accurate cephalometric detection. We first use images composed with GT landmarks as input images to train a detection model, which is treated as a teacher model. Then the teacher model is used to guide a student model, which is trained by original images, by transferring useful features.

Therefore, introducing mechatronic concepts in the design procedure can enable new possibilities, such as sensor integration and data analyses, adaptability and control. The efficiency of bulk material handling equipment in ports, agriculture and food processing is heavily influenced by the operational conditions. Typically, a piece of equipment is designed for defined operational conditions when the maximum performance can be achieved. In this work the concept of adaptability to varying operational conditions is explored by understanding the technologies implemented in other industries and the feasibility to be implemented in the bulk handling equipment design.

However, in this context, knowledge capacity is restricted, and knowledge variety is rare in different conditions, such as cross-model KD, in which the single teacher KD prohibits the student model from distilling information using cross-domain context. In this study, we aim to train a robust, lightweight student under the supervision of several expert teachers, which provide better instructive guidance compared to a single student-teacher learning framework. To be more specific, we first train five distinct convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as teachers for semantic segmentation on several datasets. To this end, several state-of-the-art augmentation transformations have also been utilized in training phase of our teachers. The impacts of such training scenarios are then assessed in terms of student robustness and accuracy. As the main contribution of this paper, our proposed multi-teacher KD paradigm endows the student with the ability to amalgamate and capture a variety of knowledge illustrations from different sources. Results demonstrated that our method outperforms the existing studies on both clean and corrupted data in the semantic segmentation task while benefiting from our proposed score weight system.

To detect new types of deepfakes, the model should learn from additional data without losing its prior knowledge about deepfakes (catastrophic forgetting), especially when new deepfakes are significantly different. In this work, we employ the Representation Learning (ReL) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigms to introduce a transfer learning-based Feature Representation Transfer Adaptation Learning (FReTAL) method. We use FReTAL to perform domain adaptation tasks on new deepfake datasets, while minimizing the catastrophic forgetting. Our student model can quickly adapt to new types of deepfake by distilling knowledge from a pre-trained teacher model and applying transfer learning without using source domain data during domain adaptation.

Generally, because batteries are used as energy sources for sensors in WSNs, a highly energy-efficient operation is needed to prolong the life of the sensors and networks. To save energy, sensors usually manage multi-mode sensing operations, in which they periodically switch between active and inactive periods. A tradeoff exists between object detection accuracy and energy efficiency when we select a sensing schedule. Depending on the object speed, direction, and sensor deployment topology, different sensing schedules should be dynamically applied to individual sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based dynamic duty cycle control method for sensor nodes. For RNN training, a target optimal duty cycle for a given network condition is derived from the proposed digital twin-space analytic solution.

In literature one can find different model compression techniques which enables easy deployment on edge devices. Knowledge distillation is one such approach where the knowledge of complex teacher model is transferred to a lower parameter student model. However, the limitation is that the architecture of the student model should be comparable to the complex teacher model for better knowledge transfer. Due to this limitation, we cannot deploy this student model that learns from a complex and huge teacher on edge devices. In this work, we propose to use a combined student approach wherein different student models learn from a common teacher model. Further, we propose a unique loss function which will train multiple student models simultaneously. An advantage of this approach is that these student models can be as simple as possible when compared with traditional single student model and also the complex teacher model. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation to prove that our approach can improve the overall accuracy significantly and allow a further compression by 10% when compared with generic model.","","978-1-6654-4494-1","10.1109/IAICT52856.2021.9532543","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9532543","Knowledge distillation;Model compression;Multiple student models","Training;Performance evaluation;Knowledge engineering;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Memory management;Object recognition","","","","35","IEEE","17 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This modification restricts the participation of samples, unlike the conventional training method. The number of times a sample participates in the self-regulated training process is a measure of its significance towards the model's knowledge. The significance values are used to weigh the losses incurred on the corresponding samples in the distillation process. This method is named significance-based distillation. Two other methods are proposed for comparison where the student model learns by distillation and incorporating self-regulation as the teacher model, either utilizing the significance information computed during the teacher's training or not.

To train classifiers that are universally robust to all noise levels, and that are not sensitive to any variation in the noise model, we propose a distillation-based framework that incorporates a new subcategory of Positive-Unlabeled learning. In particular, we shall assume that a small subset of any given noisy dataset is known to have correct labels, which we treat as “positive”, while the remaining noisy subset is treated as “unlabeled”. Our framework consists of the following two components: (1) We shall generate, via iterative updates, an augmented clean subset with additional reliable “positive” samples filtered from “unlabeled” samples; (2) We shall train a teacher model on this larger augmented clean set. With the guidance of the teacher model, we then train a student model on the whole dataset.

To further improve the data efficiency of reinforcement learning, which often requires a large amount of agent-environment interactions during the training process, we propose a digital-twin environment model that can predict the transition dynamics of the physical driving scene. Moreover, we propose a rollout prediction-compatible reinforcement learning framework, which is able to further improve the training efficiency. The proposed framework is validated in an autonomous driving task with a focus on lateral motion control. The simulation results illustrate that our method could significantly speed up the learning process and the resulting driving policy could achieve better performance, compared to the conventional reinforcement learning approach, which demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed digital-twin-enabled reinforcement learning method.","","978-1-6654-3337-2","10.1109/DTPI52967.2021.9540179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9540179","Reinforcement learning;environment digital twin model;end-to-end control;autonomous driving","Training;Digital twin;Simulation;Reinforcement learning;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Real-time systems","","2","","16","IEEE","22 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These pre-trained language models often contain hundreds of millions of parameters and suffer from high computation and latency in real-world applications. It is desirable to reduce the computation overhead of the models for fast training and inference while keeping the model performance in downstream applications. Several lines of work utilize knowledge distillation to compress the teacher model to a smaller student model. However, they usually discard the teacher's knowledge when in inference. Differently, in this paper, we propose RemERT to leverage the knowledge learned from the teacher, i.e., facilitating the pre-computed BERT representation on the reference sample and compressing BERT into a smaller student model. To guarantee our proposal, we provide theoretical justification on the loss function and the usage of reference samples. Significantly, the theoretical result shows that including the pre-computed teacher's representations on the reference samples indeed increases the mutual information in learning the student model. Finally, we conduct the empirical evaluation and show that our RemERT can beat the vanilla TinyBERT over 8.1 % and achieves more than 94% of the performance of $\mathbf{BERT}_{\mathbf{BASE}}$ on the GLUE benchmark. Meanwhile, RemERT is $\mathbf{7.4x}$ smaller and $\mathbf{9.5x}$ faster on inference than $\mathbf{BERT}_{\mathbf{BASE}}$.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-3900-8","10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9534402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9534402","BERT;knowledge distillation;reference;mutual information","Training;Quantization (signal);Computational modeling;Bit error rate;Neural networks;Benchmark testing;Natural language processing","","","","40","IEEE","23 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The MiniFactory is associated with an evolving digital profile, a digital twin, based on constant synchronization through IoT devices, that encompasses a massive, real-time, real-world data, gathered from the different sensors interfaced via OPC-UA protocol. This representation feeds a ML algorithm capable of 1) detecting defective bearings and 2) continually tuning the quality testing process parameters based on the analysis performed on the gathered data. Specifically, the identification of defective bearings is performed by a voting classifier fed by statistical metrics measured from the collected experiments. Our approach also aims at continually learning from the tests performed with the cell: the ML algorithm is tuned and adjusted every time a new set of tests is executed. Tests show that the proposed ML classifier accurately distinguishes damaged and uncorrupted bearings (accuracy ∼ 100%, precision ∼100%, recall ∼100%, TNR ∼100%). The digitalization of the quality control process is furtherly enriched by the development of a data aggregator platform.

The application of the digital twin concept improves performance of a system by implementing monitoring, diagnosis, optimisation, and decision support actions. In particular, the decision-making process is very time consuming since the decision-maker is presented with hundreds of different scenarios that can be simulated and assessed in a what-if perspective. Bearing this in mind, this paper proposes to integrate a digital twin-based what-if simulation with a recommendation system to improve the decision-making cycle.

In addition, some samples of confusable categories, and samples of different categories located near the edges, have small feature differences in a PolSAR image. To address this problem, we introduce a graph regular loss constructed from pseudo-labels to constrain the intra-class similarity and inter-class similarity of features, and improve the discriminative property of features.

Many fabrication processes like milling or gluing have high demands on accuracy and path smoothness to ensure good path tracking. Yet, industrial robot paths in cartesian space mainly consist of a sequence of linear and circular movements and hence show velocity and acceleration discontinuities in the segment transitions. This significantly limits the productivity and machining quality of the robot system. Traversing these discontinuities activates the kinematics mechanically and hence influences the accuracy and surface quality. In addition, the drives of the robot system are subjected to a higher load as a result which decreases the lifetime of the robot. Higher-order continuous paths are required to prevent this. Corner smoothing methods insert smooth, curvature continuous curves in the segment transition resulting in smooth paths. Methods based on polynomial smoothing splines either do not have any curvature-optimality properties or cannot be solved without violating the online constraints of the robot controller. To solve the conflict between the calculation of curvature-optimal smoothing curves and online execution in industrial robot controllers, this paper evaluates the use of neural networks as a model for calculating optimal geometry parameters for corner smoothing with polynomial splines. The model is trained applying supervised learning on a dataset containing offline generated pairs of geometries and optimal parameters. The presented method leads to curvature-optimized smoothing curves and is suitable for online path planning. The application of neural networks to this path planning problem is evaluated in a simulation using a digital twin model of an industrial robot.","","978-1-6654-3410-2","10.1109/AI4I51902.2021.00011","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9565548","Industrial Robot;Corner Smoothing;Path Smoothing;Neural Network;Artificial intelligence;Machine Learning;Curvature Optimal","Geometry;Productivity;Smoothing methods;Service robots;Tracking;Neural networks;Supervised learning","","1","","15","IEEE","13 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome these difficulties, this article proposes a Digital Twin (DT) empowered mobile edge computing (MEC) architecture. With MEC, the sensing and computing capabilities of the CAVs can be strengthened to guarantee real-time safety. The virtualization and offline learning capabilities of the DT can be leveraged to enable the CAVs to learn from the experience of the physical MEC network and make lane-changing decisions via a ‘foresight intelligent’ approach. A case study of lane-changing is provided where the DT is constituted by a cellular automata based road traffic simulator coupled with a LTE-V based MEC network simulator.

However, any intelligent environment must include humans. In this case, the interactions between humans and agents, referred to as human-agent interaction (HAI), will occur in complex arrangements involving multiple humans and agents interacting concurrently along with various scenarios. Agents’ ability to learn and perform their tasks is contingent on some degree of consistency in their interactions with humans. A lack of such consistency would jeopardize their learning and performance. It is thus necessary to integrate humans and agents across the entire environment consistently. Assuming that HAI is a complex system, the paper argues that ensuring HAI consistency can be achieved by deploying a new class of agents devoted to managing human-agent interactions, the Human Digital Twin (HDT). The proposed HDTs are placed alongside each human in the HAI environment to observe and learn about their interaction patterns and then use them to ensure HAI consistency.","","978-1-6654-1348-0","10.1109/IRCE53649.2021.9570890","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9570890","Human-Agent Interactions;Human-Machine Teaming;Human Digital Twin","Control engineering;Smart cities;Digital twin;Collaboration;Task analysis;Complex systems;Artificial intelligence","","2","","12","IEEE","19 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these issues, in this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient FL framework for DT-enabled IIoT. In the proposed framework, IIoT devices choose different training methods considering dynamic time-varying environment status to achieve energy-efficient FL, i.e., either train locally or connect to the virtual object by DT in the corresponding server of a small base station (SBS) to train mapped data using computing resources of SBS. Then, we investigate the joint training method selection and resource allocation problem to minimize the energy consumption while satisfying the convergence rate of the training model.

In particular, we propose to incorporate barrier functions and smooth spline-based motion parametrization in the training loss function. The advantage is twofold: improving safety of the learning algorithm, while reducing the amount of needed training data. Moreover, the behavior is learned from highway driving data, which is collected consistently by a human driver and then processed towards a specific driving scenario. For development validation, a digital twin of the real test vehicle, sensors, and traffic scenarios are reconstructed toward high-fidelity and physics-based modeling technologies. These models are imported to simulation tools and co-simulated with the proposed algorithm for validation and further testing.

This task is challenging due to large intra-class variations and a severe lack of ground truth. A popular solution is to learn correspondences from synthetic data. However, because of the limited intra-class appearance and background variations within synthetically generated training data, the model’s capability for handling “real” image pairs using such strategy is intrinsically constrained. We address this problem with the use of a novel Probabilistic Model Distillation (PMD) approach which transfers knowledge learned by a probabilistic teacher model on synthetic data to a static student model with the use of unlabeled real image pairs. A probabilistic supervision reweighting (PSR) module together with a confidence-aware loss (CAL) is used to mine the useful knowledge and alleviate the impact of errors. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks show that our PMD achieves state-of-the-art performance. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we extend PMD to incorporate stronger supervision for better accuracy – the probabilistic teacher is trained with stronger key-point supervision. Again, we observe the superiority of our PMD. The extensive experiments verify that PMD is able to infer more reliable supervision signals from the probabilistic teacher for representation learning and largely alleviate the influence of errors in pseudo labels.

Recently, both unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from large amounts of synthetic data and semi-supervised learning (SSL) with small set of labeled data have been studied to alleviate this issue. However, there is still a large gap on performance compared to their supervised counterparts. We focus on a more practical setting of semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) where both a small set of labeled target data and large amounts of labeled source data are available. To address the task of SSDA, a novel framework based on dual-level domain mixing is proposed. The proposed framework consists of three stages. First, two kinds of data mixing methods are proposed to reduce domain gap in both region-level and sample-level respectively. We can obtain two complementary domain-mixed teachers based on dual-level mixed data from holistic and partial views respectively. Then, a student model is learned by distilling knowledge from these two teachers. Finally, pseudo labels of unlabeled data are generated in a self-training manner for another few rounds of teachers training. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework on synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation benchmarks.","2575-7075","978-1-6654-4509-2","10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.01087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9578665","","Training;Adaptation models;Image segmentation;Computer vision;Costs;Semantics;Benchmark testing","","29","","50","IEEE","2 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We then train a student model on both labels and pseudo labels to generate final feature embeddings. We use self-supervised representation learning to initialize the teacher model. To better deal with noisy pseudo labels generated by the teacher network, we design a new feature basis learning component for the student network, which learns basis functions of feature representations for unlabeled data. The learned basis vectors better measure the pairwise similarity and are used to select high-confident samples for training the student network. We evaluate our method on standard retrieval benchmarks: CUB-200, Cars-196 and In-shop.

Its success is generally attributed to the privileged information on similarities/consistency between the class distributions or intermediate feature representations of the teacher model and the student model. However, directly pushing the student model to mimic the probabilities/features of the teacher model to a large extent limits the student model in learning undiscovered knowledge/features. In this paper, we propose a novel inheritance and exploration knowledge distillation framework (IE-KD), in which a student model is split into two parts - inheritance and exploration. The inheritance part is learned with a similarity loss to transfer the existing learned knowledge from the teacher model to the student model, while the exploration part is encouraged to learn representations different from the inherited ones with a dis-similarity loss. Our IE-KD framework is generic and can be easily combined with existing distillation or mutual learning methods for training deep neural networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these two parts can jointly push the student model to learn more diversified and effective representations, and our IE-KD can be a general technique to improve the student network to achieve SOTA performance. Furthermore, by applying our IE-KD to the training of two networks, the performance of both can be improved w.r.t. deep mutual learning.","2575-7075","978-1-6654-4509-2","10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9577943","","Training;Learning systems;Knowledge engineering;Deep learning;Computer vision;Neural networks;Reinforcement learning","","12","","36","IEEE","2 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most domain adaptation methods are only restricted to single-source-single-target pair, and can not be directly extended to multiple target domains. In this work, we propose a collaborative learning framework to achieve unsupervised multi-target domain adaptation. An unsupervised domain adaptation expert model is first trained for each source-target pair and is further encouraged to collaborate with each other through a bridge built between different target domains. These expert models are further improved by adding the regularization of making the consistent pixel-wise prediction for each sample with the same structured context. To obtain a single model that works across multiple target domains, we propose to simultaneously learn a student model which is trained to not only imitate the output of each expert on the corresponding target domain, but also to pull different expert close to each other with regularization on their weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively exploit rich structured information contained in both labeled source domain and multiple unlabeled target domains. Not only does it perform well across multiple target domains but also performs favorably against state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods specially trained on a single source-target pair.

Our country's port and hydraulic building facilities are now the world's largest, most of which are concrete structures. However, there will be more freeze-thaw damage to concrete structures, and there is less research on the durability test methods of hydraulic structures, especially the life prediction of hydraulic structures after freeze-thaw damage repairs. Based on this, this article has launched a research on the durability life prediction technology of port hydraulic structures driven by the integration of digital twins and deep learning. Aiming at the difficult problem of predicting and maintaining the status of port hydraulic buildings in a harsh working environment, combined with the high-fidelity behavior simulation characteristics of digital twins and the powerful data mining capabilities of deep learning, this paper mainly studies the mutual driving of digital twins and deep learning. In this paper, multiple digital twins of the shearer are constructed based on multiple physical and spatial parameters. Through multiple visual displays and data analysis in the virtual space, the health status is predicted, and a port based on deep machine learning is established. The residual life prediction model of the key parts of hydraulic structures realizes real-time monitoring on the network; integrates the residual life and residual life value of the building parts driven by data, and integrates the status of the digital twin and the residual life of the parts and the port Durability assessment of hydraulic construction buildings. The research results show that although a little steel slag can significantly improve the heat resistance and compressive strength of concrete, when the content of steel slag exceeds a certain meaning, the heat resistance and compressive strength of concrete will change. When the steel slag content reaches 10%, the effect is best. When the steel slag content reaches 20%, the 28d concrete compressive strength and strength will not have a big impact.","","978-1-6654-2665-7","10.1109/CIPAE53742.2021.00051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9610596","Digital Twin;Deep Learning;Port Hydraulic Structures;Durability Life Prediction Technology","Resistance;Deep learning;Ports (computers);Digital twin;Buildings;Slag;Concrete","","1","","14","IEEE","26 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Dividing activities into actions helps to further conceptualize motion models for predicting what a human intends to do in a hybrid work system. However, it is not straightforward to identify human intentions in collaborative operations for robots to understand and collaborate. This paper presents a concept for semantic representation of human actions and intention prediction using a flexible task ontology interface in the semantic data hub stored in a domain knowledge base. This semantic data hub enables the construction of a DT with corresponding reasoning and simulation algorithms. Furthermore, a knowledge-based DT concept is used to analyze and verify the presented use-case of Human-Robot Collaboration in assembly operations. The preliminary evaluation showed a promising reduction of time for assembly tasks, which identifies the potential to i) improve efficiency reflected by reducing costs and errors and ultimately ii) assist human workers in improving decision making. Thus the contribution of the current work involves a marriage of machine learning, robotics, and ontology engineering into DT to improve human-robot interaction and productivity in a collaborative production environment.","","978-1-7281-2989-1","10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613342","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9613342","human-robot interaction;digital twin;human action models;ontology;machine learning","Productivity;Digital twin;Semantics;Knowledge based systems;Collaboration;Predictive models;Ontologies","","10","","52","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, identifying the location and size of cracks in transmission pipes has received much attention. Thus, in this research, the combination of fuzzy digital twin (FDT), support vector machine (SVM), and backstepping (BS) observer is suggested for leak detection and localization. In the first stage, the proposed fuzzy digital twin is introduced. So, first, the flow rate in the healthy condition is modeled using the fuzzy Gaussian process Regression (FGR) which is a combination of Gaussian process Regression (GR) and fuzzy algorithm. After that, in the second stage, the flowrate signals are estimated using the fuzzy digital twin that is a combination of FGR, BS technique, and fuzzy procedure. The proposed FDT is used to modeling and estimated the flow rate in the pipeline in normal and abnormal conditions. Moreover, it can be used for data generation. After modeling and estimated data using FDT, in the next step, the residual data is generated to improve the accuracy of crack localization. Next, the crack is detected by the combination of the SVM and FDT. To find the location of the crack, the combination of FDT and the backstepping algorithm is suggested. The Ulsan Industrial Artificial Intelligence (VIAl) Lab dataset is used to test the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The results show that the proposed FDT is 25% improved in the accuracy for fault localization compared with the classical digital twin.","2162-1233","978-1-6654-2383-0","10.1109/ICTC52510.2021.9621121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9621121","Digital twin;crack localization;machine learning;backstepping observer;support vector machine;fuzzy logic technique;Gaussian process Regression;pipelines","Support vector machines;Location awareness;Backstepping;Machine learning algorithms;Digital twin;Pipelines;Gaussian processes","","1","","19","IEEE","7 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As far as the metallurgy is concerned, the units with the highest energy consumption are furnaces. This fact makes it actual to try to develop “Digital Twins” of such furnaces. One of the main constituent parts of the “Digital Twin” is a kind of a mathematical model, such as finite-difference or data-based ones. In this research: 1) the finite-difference model of the steel heating process, which is based on the differential equation of transient heat conduction, is developed; 2) the obtained finite-difference model is compared with the data-based one, which is obtained as a result of application of the machine learning algorithms and extreme gradient boosting method modification (DART) to the data obtained from the furnace; 3) conclusions are made on the advantages and disadvantages of these models.

We propose a novel personalized speech enhancement method to adapt a compact denoising model to the test-time specificity. Our goal in this test-time adaptation is to utilize no clean speech target of the test speaker, thus fulfilling the requirement for zero-shot learning. To complement the lack of clean speech, we employ the knowledge distillation framework: we distill the more advanced denoising results from an overly large teacher model, and use them as the pseudo target to train the small student model. This zero-shot learning procedure circumvents the process of collecting users' clean speech, a process that users are reluctant to comply due to privacy concerns and technical difficulty of recording clean voice.

The handful of works that look at tailoring their explanation to the user’s background rely on having specific models of the users (either analytic models or learned labeling models).

For these reasons, the adoption of RL in industrial settings is not common. Behavior Trees (BTs), on the other hand, can provide a policy representation that a) supports modular and composable skills, b) allows for easy interpretation of the robot actions, and c) provides an advantageous low-dimensional parameter space.

A heuristic technology to enable real-time intelligent fault detection is digital twin technology. Digital twin technology allows a tandem establishment between real-world machines and the virtual domain, allowing for the inclusion of optimization and maintenance frameworks. Sparsely represented machines in the digital twin domain are linear actuators, which form essential parts of various industrial and commercial machines. Therefore, this study has modelled a data-driven and multi-physics robotic linear actuator digital twin, and integrated it with a custom designed fault detection mechanism using Naïve Bayes classifier. This architecture can autonomously be deployed in tandem to the physical machine to alarm and diagnose electrical faults as soon as they occur in the machine. As compared with conventional diagnostics this will reduce machine down-time and expedite repairs. The resultant model built on MATLAB, Simulink gave an accuracy of 96% and required minimal processing capability to operate.

Programming has become an essential skill to solve realworld problems in modern engineering disciplines. However, when students start to learn how to program, they face a lot of challenges in acquiring various programming knowledge and skills. While it is beneficial to customise learning material to fit individual learning progress, the widely different learning pace of students in an introductory programming course has made it impractical for teachers to track the knowledge acquisition of individual. Hence, many recent works take a data-driven approach to model students' learning progress based on the performance data in programming-related exercises, which include the submitted program codes and answers to closed-ended programming exercises. By analyzing these performance data, a system can evaluate the students' knowledge level of various concepts and skills in programming. This paper performs a systematic review and reports key information about recent works on programming knowledge tracing based on student performance data. An overview of the different choices of knowledge representation, domain knowledge model, performance measure and knowledge tracing algorithms is provided. The nature and granularity of knowledge components and the relationships between them are compared across the reviewed works. The different choice of programming knowledge representation leads to varied methods to assess knowledge levels from empirical performance data in programming-related exercises. Two broad categories of works are identified. The first is to overlay a student model on the domain knowledge model, and the student knowledge levels are updated in distinct time steps. The second trains temporal knowledge tracing models to predict students' future performance based on their performance in previous exercises. In addition, this review discusses the distinct challenges in knowledge tracing in programming education. It also points out limitations in current works and opportunities to improve knowledge tracing in learning programming.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637323","systematic review;computer science;programming education;student modelling;knowledge tracing","Systematics;Codes;Knowledge acquisition;Conferences;Education;Knowledge representation;Predictive models","","2","","36","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, a large and growing body of literature has investigated how energy consumption in PONs can be minimized. Existing research indicates that sleep mode is an effective means for reducing energy consumption in PONs. There is also a growing number of contributions that demonstrate the importance of integrating PON with Software-defined Networking (SDN). Such integration facilitates a programmable PON, which can dynamically adjust its operation on-the-fly based on the decision made by a SDN controller. The most important limitations in the previous energy-efficient PON research lies in the fact that they failed to address how the energy saving and traffic performance can be fed in real-time into the network operation decision process. Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging field of research in the communication networking area. DT can bridge between real and virtual world making a significant contribution in defining optimal operation of the network. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Digital-twin-assisted Software-defined PON framework in order to feed the network performance data in real-time to the network operation decision support system, which aims at maximizing energy conservation while meeting quality of service, and control PON infrastructure on-the-fly.

Apart from the organization and internal communication of the platoons, real-time prediction of surrounding road users (such as vehicles and cyclists) is another critical issue. While artificial intelligence (AI) is receiving increasing interests on its application to trajectory prediction, there is a potential problem that the pre-trained neural network models may not well fit the current driving environment and needs online fine-tuning to maintain an acceptable high prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a digital twin based real-time trajectory prediction scheme for platoons of connected intelligent vehicles. In this scheme the head vehicle of a platoon senses the surrounding vehicles. A LSTM neural network is applied for real-time trajectory prediction with the sensing outcomes. The head vehicle controls the offloading of the trajectory data and maintains a digital twin to optimize the update of LSTM model. In the digital twin a Deep-Q Learning (DQN) algorithm is utilized for adaptive fine tuning of the LSTM model, to ensure the prediction accuracy and minimize the consumption of communication and computing resources. A real-world dataset is developed from the KITTI datasets for simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed trajectory prediction scheme can maintain a prediction accuracy for safe platooning and reduce the delay of updating the neural networks by up to 40%.","2643-3303","978-1-6654-4131-5","10.1109/ICNP52444.2021.9651970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9651970","intelligent platoon;trajectory prediction;digital twin;LSTM neural network updating","Adaptation models;Digital twin;Computational modeling;Simulation;Neural networks;Predictive models;Real-time systems","","1","","14","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Application of existing black-box calibration methods, therefore, often require repeatedly evaluating a model over a wide range of parameters. For some parameter combinations, the simulations could be unreasonably slow or fail altogether. In general, the shape of subregions in the parameter space that could result in simulation failure is unknown and near-impossible to ascertain analytically. In this paper, we propose a novel failure robust Bayesian optimization (FR-BO) algorithm that learns these failure regions from simulation data and informs a Bayesian optimization algorithm to avoid failure regions while searching for optimal parameters. This results in acceleration of the optimizer’s convergence and prevents wastage of time trying to simulate parameters with high failure probabilities.","2577-1655","978-1-6654-4207-7","10.1109/SMC52423.2021.9658893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9658893","Machine learning;Bayesian optimization;model simulation;digital twin;feasibility analysis;numerical methods;Gaussian processes","Analytical models;Shape;Computational modeling;Software algorithms;Estimation;Software;Calibration","","2","","18","IEEE","6 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel method named efficient facial landmark detector (EFLD), which significantly compresses the model size and computational cost while achieving superior performance compared with state-of-the-art frameworks. We introduce a knowledge distillation framework suitable for facial landmark detection, which can transfer geometric information from the pre-trained teacher model to the lightweight student model. In addition, we integrate adversarial learning into the knowledge distillation framework to guide the student model to imitate the heatmap distribution generated by the teacher model.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. We believe data science and AI will change the world. No matter how smart and powerful an AI model we can build, the ultimate testimony of the success of data science and AI is users’ trust. How can we build trustworthy data science? At the level of user-model interaction, how can we convince users that a data analytic result is trustworthy? At the level of group-wise collaboration for data science and AI, how can we ensure that the parties and their contributions are recognized fairly, and establish trust between the outcome (e.g., a model built) of the group collaboration and the external users? At the level of data science participant eco-systems, how can we effectively and efficiently connect many participants of various roles and facilitate the connection among supplies and demands of data and models? In this talk, I will brainstorm possible directions to the above questions in the context of an endto-end data science pipeline. To strengthen trustworthy interactions between models and users, I will advocate exact and consistent interpretation of machine learning models. Our recent results show that exact and consistent interpretations are not just theoretically feasible, but also practical even for API-based AI services. To build trust in collaboration among multiple participants in coalition, I will review some progress in ensuring fairness in federated learning, including fair assessment of contributions and fairness enforcement in collaboration outcome. Last, to address the need of trustworthy data science eco-systems, I will review some latest efforts in building data and model marketplaces and preserving fairness and privacy. Through reflection I will discuss some challenges and opportunities in building trustworthy data science for possible future work.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671278","","Data science;Big Data;Industries;Data models;Collaboration;Brain modeling;Conferences","","","","","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most significant will be real-time, active management of the systems making up a Smart City. Active management will be enabled by processing large amounts of real-time data, by machine learning to deliver timely insights and by large-scale simulation to create effective interventions. To realise active management of Smart Cities requires processing systems that can take in data at large volume and variety, and perform complex processing on these data, all in real-time. Digital twins are used to create a continuous, consistent view of the current state of the city, and simulation of the evolution of digitals twins is used to detect problems arising in the near future and to optimise the impact of interventions. In this paper we propose and validate a Smart City processing architecture that can deliver these benefits by building a digital twin of a city, combining real-time streamed data ingestion, simulation and analytics. Streamed data systems can deliver a real time response with large amount of incoming data but are not suited to time advancing simulations where the interaction between modelled objects is important. We propose a processing architecture that mitigates this limitation by separating object interactions from streamed data processing. Finally, we introduce DEDUCE-PT, a demonstration implementation of this Smart City processing architecture that is aimed at proactive management of public transport systems.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671660","smart city;streaming data;big data;simulation;transport;digital twin","Smart cities;Digital twin;Architecture;Conferences;Buildings;Machine learning;Big Data","","","","17","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In light of these challenges, we propose a multi-guidance model with bidirectional distillation for medical dialogue generation. Firstly, we fuse different guidance signals (keywords, categories and summaries) with neural sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model as teacher models. Meanwhile, we consider a simplified model without guidance as the student model. We also propose an attention mechanism to ensemble for the fusion of knowledge from multiple teachers. We further develop a bidirectional distillation module to exchange the knowledge between the teachers and a student from both sides during the training process.

When the network size gap between the teacher and student increases, the performance of the student network decreases. To solve this problem, an intermediate model is employed between the teacher model and the student model known as the teaching assistant model, which in turn bridges the gap between the teacher and the student. In this research, we have shown that using multiple teaching assistant models, the student model (the smaller model) can be further improved. We combined these multiple teaching assistant model using weighted ensemble learning where we have used a differential evaluation optimization algorithm to generate the weight values.","","978-1-6654-3858-2","10.1109/ICKG52313.2021.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9667739","teaching assistant;knowledge distillation;en-semble learning;optimization","Performance evaluation;Knowledge engineering;Conferences;Education;Machine learning;Mobile handsets;Optimization","","","","20","IEEE","14 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are severe data imbalance problems in extractive machine reading comprehension (MRC) tasks: unbalanced data will lead to differences between training and testing. Without a balanced label, the learning process tends to meet to a point, strongly biasing towards the class and the majority of labels. The most used cross-entropy criteria are accuracy-oriented, mainly focusing on the majority class to achieve high accuracy. Another problem is that the training of the model only introduces correct knowledge, which is not accurate enough for answer prediction. To address these issues, we propose to use focal loss in replacement of the standard cross-entropy objective for data imbalanced MRC tasks, which uses weight coefficients to adjust the weight of positive and negative samples and distinguish between easy and difficult samples. We propose using the same model to perform mirror distillation so that the teacher model can provide the correct and wrong knowledge for the student model to learn, obtain better model generalization ability, and improve the accuracy of answer prediction. Our results show that our mirror distillation method significantly improves the performance of the model. Moreover, our results also prove that the focal loss effectively solves the problem of data imbalance in the task.","","978-1-6654-8311-7","10.1109/IALP54817.2021.9675272","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61702443,61966038,61762091); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9675272","MRC;data imbalance;BERT;mirror distillation;focal loss","Training;Predictive models;Natural language processing;Data models;Robustness;Mirrors;Data mining","","1","","22","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The framework consists of a teacher model and a student model with the same structure and the student model learns from the teacher model by minimizing a segmentation loss generated from labeled images and a consistency loss generated from unlabeled images with respect to the targets of the teacher model. To enable the student model learn from more reliable targets, we introduce the Monte Carlo Dropout which estimates target uncertainty, and a novel dual attention mechanism which helps the network to focus on information in shape and channel dimension. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments on MICCAI 2017 Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset. Experiments show that our proposed DA-UAMT model is effective in utilizing unlabeled data to obtain considerably better segmentation of cardiac.","2329-6259","978-1-6654-2655-8","10.1109/PIC53636.2021.9687054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9687054","semi-supervised learning;dual attention mechanism;uncertainty-aware;cardiac segmentation","Training;Image segmentation;Uncertainty;Monte Carlo methods;Shape;Semisupervised learning;Reliability","","","","24","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These applications require advanced computing models which allow for the processing of massive gathered amounts of data. Motions, gestures and object modification should be captured, added to the virtual environment, and shared with all the participants. Relying only on the cloud to process this data can cause significant delays. Therefore, a hybrid cloud/edge architecturewith an intelligent resource orchestration mechanism, that is able to allocate the available capacities efficiently is necessary. In this paper, a blockchain and federated learning-enabled predicted edge-resource allocation (FLP-RA) algorithm is introduced to manage the allocation of computing resources in B5G networks. It allows for smart edge nodes to train their local data and share it with other nodes to create a global estimation of future network loads.

However, due to poor real-time performance and lack of effective incentive methods, it is difficult for traditional path planning schemes to significantly improve the efficiency of traffic management. In addition, existing solutions that use driving distance and driving time as indicators cannot meet the personalized requirements of vehicle users. To this end, by considering the personalized requirements of vehicle users, we propose a digital-twin (DT) enabled path planning scheme to facilitate traffic management. To be specific, based on the collection of traffic data, we first establish a DT architecture for traffic scheduling to reduce the delay of path planning. Then, according to the traffic density of different road sections, we regard road sections as resources and set different rewards for different road sections to encourage vehicles to obey the scheduling instructions. In addition, by jointly considering the driving time and rewards, we further design personalized utility models to map the requirements of different vehicle users. After that, based on the personalized requirement of the vehicle user, we use a $Q$-learning algorithm to obtain the optimal path with the target of maximizing the user's utility. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can bring higher utility to the vehicle users than the conventional schemes.","","978-1-7281-8104-2","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685559","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1600100); NSFC(grant numbers:61901341); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021TQ0260); XAST(grant numbers:095920201322); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JB210113); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9685559","Intelligent transportation system;vehicular networks;path planning;digital twin;$Q$-learning","Roads;Simulation;Conferences;Transportation;Dynamic scheduling;Path planning;Real-time systems","","3","","24","IEEE","2 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, to further prevent data leakage against these attacks, we propose FL-PATE, a differentially private federated learning framework with knowledge transfer. Specifically, participants with sensitive data are grouped to train teacher models under federated learning settings, and the knowledge of teacher models is transferred to a publicly accessible student model for prediction via aggregating teacher models' outputs of public datasets. A modified client-level differential privacy mechanism is used to guarantee each participant's data privacy during the corresponding teacher model's training process. The proposed framework preserves participant's privacy against membership inference attacks and the differential privacy cost is fixed. The privacy analysis and experiments demonstrate that trained teacher and student models have an excellent performance in accuracy and robustness theoretically and empirically.","","978-1-7281-8104-2","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685079","NSFC(grant numbers:U1808207,U20A20175); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9685079","Differential Privacy;Knowledge Transfer;Federated Learning;Privacy Preservation","Training;Differential privacy;Privacy;Costs;Predictive models;Collaborative work;Data models","","5","","19","IEEE","2 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It utilizes smart medical devices and cloud computing services along with core Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to sense patients' vital body parameters, monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to support just-in-time health services. Mostly, this large amount of data is analyzed in centralized servers. Anomaly Detection (AD) in a centralized healthcare ecosystem is often plagued by significant delays in response time with high performance overhead. Moreover, there are inherent privacy issues associated with sending patients' personal health data to a centralized server, which may also introduce several security threats to the AD model, such as possibility of data poisoning. To overcome these issues with centralized AD models, here we propose a Federated Learning (FL) based AD model which utilizes edge cloudlets to run AD models locally without sharing patients' data. Since existing FL approaches perform aggregation on a single server which restricts the scope of FL, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical FL that allows aggregation at different levels enabling multi-party collaboration. We introduce a novel disease-based grouping mechanism where different AD models are grouped based on specific types of diseases. Furthermore, we develop a new Federated Time Distributed (FEDTIMEDIS) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to train the AD model.

As a common and essential part of the pipeline system, valves are used to regulate fluid flow within pipelines to achieve a desired flow condition. However, the local flow characteristics within the valve domain are difficult to determine experimentally because of complex geometry and inaccessibility of the flow domain. The application of DT technology in pipelines allows real-time fluid flow data transmission both at global and local levels, and performance monitoring of the system as well as for predicting remaining useful life. Big data analytics and machine learning can be leveraged to improve valve system performance prediction as well as to improve safety.

Based on that, this paper proposes a simulation-optimization framework for the DT model of a Beverage Manufacturing Plant. A data-driven simulation model developed in Simio is integrated with Python to perform Multi-Objective optimization. The framework explores optimal solutions by simulating multiple scenarios by altering the availability of operators and dispatching/scheduling rules. The results show that simulation optimization can be integrated into the Digital-Twin models as part of real-time production planning and scheduling.","1558-4305","978-1-6654-3311-2","10.1109/WSC52266.2021.9715412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9715412","","Adaptation models;Schedules;Analytical models;Software packages;Digital twin;Layout;Real-time systems","","3","","16","IEEE","23 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper surveys the traditional field of automated planning and explores its application to the field of information security and in particular, automating cyber incident response. Relevant AI planning techniques are then applied to implement a prototype which demonstrates the feasibility of automating incident response, focusing on False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA) against smart grid as a use case.

However, existing pose distillation works rely on a heavy pre-trained estimator to perform knowledge transfer and require a complex two-stage learning procedure. In this work, we investigate a novel Online Knowledge Distillation framework by distilling Human Pose structure knowledge in a one-stage manner to guarantee the distillation efficiency, termed OKDHP. Specifically, OKDHP trains a single multi-branch network and acquires the predicted heatmaps from each, which are then assembled by a Feature Aggregation Unit (FAU) as the target heatmaps to teach each branch in reverse. Instead of simply averaging the heatmaps, FAU which consists of multiple parallel transformations with different receptive fields, leverages the multi-scale information, thus obtains target heatmaps with higher-quality. Specifically, the pixel-wise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is utilized to mini-mize the discrepancy between the target heatmaps and the predicted ones, which enables the student network to learn the implicit keypoint relationship. Besides, an unbalanced OKDHP scheme is introduced to customize the student networks with different compression rates.

Our approach has three steps. First, we train specialized teachers independently on labeled datasets. We then use the specialized teachers to label an unlabeled dataset to create a multi-task pseudo labeled dataset. Finally, the dataset, which now contains pseudo labels from teacher models trained on different datasets/tasks, is then used to train a student model with multi-task learning. We evaluate the feature representations of the student model on 6 vision tasks including image recognition (classification, detection, segmentation) and 3D geometry estimation (depth and surface normal estimation). MuST is scalable with unlabeled or partially labeled datasets and outperforms both specialized supervised models and self-supervised models when training on large scale datasets.

We propose a novel adversarial training-based model by Attention Guided Knowledge Distillation and Bi-directional Metric Learning (AGKD-BML). The attention knowledge is obtained from a weight-fixed model trained on a clean dataset, referred to as a teacher model, and transferred to a model that is under training on adversarial examples (AEs), referred to as a student model. In this way, the student model is able to focus on the correct region, as well as correcting the intermediate features corrupted by AEs to eventually improve the model accuracy. Moreover, to efficiently regularize the representation in feature space, we propose a bidirectional metric learning. Specifically, given a clean image, it is first attacked to its most confusing class to get the forward AE. A clean image in the most confusing class is then randomly picked and attacked back to the original class to get the backward AE. A triplet loss is then used to shorten the representation distance between original image and its AE, while enlarge that between the forward and backward AEs. We conduct extensive adversarial robustness experiments on two widely used datasets with different attacks. Our proposed AGKD-BML model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

This paper proposes a spatial uncertainty-aware semi-supervised approach via regularized surrogate task (binary segmentation) for crowd counting problems. Different from existing semi-supervised learning-based crowd counting methods, to exploit the unlabeled data, our proposed spatial uncertainty-aware teacher-student framework focuses on high confident regions’ information while addressing the noisy supervision from the unlabeled data in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we estimate the spatial uncertainty maps from the teacher model’s surrogate task to guide the feature learning of the main task (density regression) and the surrogate task of the student model at the same time. Besides, we introduce a simple yet effective differential transformation layer to enforce the inherent spatial consistency regularization between the main task and the surrogate task in the student model, which helps the surrogate task to yield more reliable predictions and generates high-quality uncertainty maps. Thus, our model can also address the task-level perturbation problems that occur spatial inconsistency between the primary and surrogate tasks in the student model.

Currently, lane detection relies on a huge amount of annotated images, which is a heavy burden. Active learning has been proposed to reduce annotation in many computer vision tasks, but no effort has been made for lane detection. Through experiments, we find that existing active learning methods perform poorly for lane detection, and the reasons are twofold. On one hand, most methods evaluate data uncertainties based on entropy, which is undesirable in lane detection because it encourages to select images with very few lanes or even no lane at all. On the other hand, existing methods are not aware of the noise of lane annotations, which is caused by heavy occlusion and unclear lane marks. In this paper, we build a novel knowledge distillation framework and evaluate the uncertainty of images based on the knowledge learnt by the student model. We show that the proposed uncertainty metric overcomes the above two problems. To reduce data redundancy, we explore the influence sets of image samples, and propose a new diversity metric for data selection. Finally we incorporate the uncertainty and diversity metrics, and develop a greedy algorithm for data selection. The experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art on the lane detection benchmarks.

Our method aims at introducing the teacher model, which can utilize data from tasks so far, to prevent the student model from catastrophic forgetting. For each task, the teacher model learn to capture the knowledge contained in the tasks by now. When a new task is presented, the student model is encouraged to learn from the teacher model so that the information on which the previous task relied is retained.

However, such generic aesthetics models neglect the fact that users’ aesthetic preferences vary significantly depending on their unique preferences. Therefore, it is essential to tackle the issue for personalized IAA (PIAA). Since PIAA is a typical small sample learning (SSL) problem, existing PIAA models are usually built by fine-tuning the well-established generic IAA (GIAA) models, which are regarded as prior knowledge. Nevertheless, this kind of prior knowledge based on “average aesthetics” fails to incarnate the aesthetic diversity of different people. In order to learn the shared prior knowledge when different people judge aesthetics, that is, learn how people judge image aesthetics, we propose a PIAA method based on meta-learning with bilevel gradient optimization (BLG-PIAA), which is trained using individual aesthetic data directly and generalizes to unknown users quickly. The proposed approach consists of two phases: 1) meta-training and 2) meta-testing. In meta-training, the aesthetics assessment of each user is regarded as a task, and the training set of each task is divided into two sets: 1) support set and 2) query set. Unlike traditional methods that train a GIAA model based on average aesthetics, we train an aesthetic meta-learner model by bilevel gradient updating from the support set to the query set using many users’ PIAA tasks. In meta-testing, the aesthetic meta-learner model is fine-tuned using a small amount of aesthetic data of a target user to obtain the PIAA model. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art PIAA metrics, and the learned prior model of BLG-PIAA can be quickly adapted to unseen PIAA tasks.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2020.2984670","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20181354); Science and Technology Plan of Xi’an(grant numbers:20191122015KYPT011JC013); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:KYCX19_2142); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of China University of Mining and Technology(grant numbers:KYCX19_2142); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771473,61991451,61379143); Six Talent Peaks High-Level Talents in Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:XYDXX-063); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9115059","Bilevel gradient optimization;meta-learning;personalized image aesthetics assessment (PIAA);small sample learning (SSL)","Task analysis;Adaptation models;Optimization;Visualization;Integrated circuit modeling;Training","Esthetics;Humans;Learning","17","","55","IEEE","11 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, we utilize a teacher network trained on a large amount of data in a related task to separately learn knowledge of the face photo and knowledge of the face sketch and simultaneously transfer this knowledge to two student networks designed for the face photo–sketch synthesis task. In addition to assimilating the knowledge from the teacher network, the two student networks can mutually transfer their own knowledge to further enhance their learning. To further enhance the perception quality of the synthetic image, we propose a KD+ model that combines GANs with KD.

Finally, the knowledge of the expert model is distilled into the student model through a novel loss function, which encourages the student model to predict the hard label provided by manual annotation. Thus, the model can match the soft label provided by the expert model and pay more attention to the hard examples simultaneously. With this method, the student model cannot only deal with hard categories but also hard examples existing in other easy categories.

However, it is still difficult to analyze and estimate the real-time structural and environmental parameters in terms of their dynamic changes in digital twinning, especially when facing detection tasks of multiple small objects from a large-scale scene with complex contexts in modern manufacturing environments. In this article, we focus on a small object detection model for DT, aiming to realize the dynamic synchronization between a physical manufacturing system and its virtual representation. Three significant elements, including equipment, product, and operator, are considered as the basic environmental parameters to represent and estimate the dynamic characteristics and real-time changes in building a generic DT system of smart manufacturing workshop.

To address the problem, in this article, we propose a social-aware vehicular edge caching mechanism that dynamically orchestrates the cache capability of roadside units (RSUs) and smart vehicles according to user preference similarity and service availability. Furthermore, catering to the complexity and variability of vehicular social characteristics, we leverage the digital twin technology to map the edge caching system into virtual space, which facilitates constructing the social relation model. Based on the social model, a new concept of vehicular cache cloud is developed to incorporate the correlation of content storing between multiple cache-enabled vehicles in diverse traffic environments. Then, we propose deep learning empowered optimal caching schemes, jointly considering the social model construction, cache cloud formation, and cache resource allocation. We evaluate the proposed schemes based on real traffic data.

Then, a self-supervised learning framework is constructed: confident predictions from teacher models are served as annotations to guide the student model to learn optical flow for those less confident predictions. The self-supervised learning framework enables us to effectively learn optical flow from unlabeled data, not only for non-occluded pixels, but also for occluded pixels. DistillFlow achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised learning performance on both KITTI and Sintel datasets.

Container orchestration platforms have emerged to alleviate this problem with prior art either using heuristics to quickly reach scheduling decisions or AI driven methods like reinforcement learning and evolutionary approaches to adapt to dynamic scenarios. The former often fail to quickly adapt in highly dynamic environments, whereas the latter have run-times that are slow enough to negatively impact response time. Therefore, there is a need for scheduling policies that are both reactive to work efficiently in volatile environments and have low scheduling overheads. To achieve this, we propose a Gradient Based Optimization Strategy using Back-propagation of gradients with respect to Input (GOBI). Further, we leverage the accuracy of predictive digital-twin models and simulation capabilities by developing a Coupled Simulation and Container Orchestration Framework (COSCO). Using this, we create a hybrid simulation driven decision approach, GOBI*, to optimize Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. Co-simulation and the back-propagation approaches allow these methods to adapt quickly in volatile environments.

To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Task FL (MTFL) algorithm that introduces non-federated Batch-Normalization (BN) layers into the federated DNN. MTFL benefits UA and convergence speed by allowing users to train models personalised to their own data. MTFL is compatible with popular iterative FL optimisation algorithms such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), and we show empirically that a distributed form of Adam optimisation (FedAvg-Adam) benefits convergence speed even further when used as the optimisation strategy within MTFL. Experiments using MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate that MTFL is able to significantly reduce the number of rounds required to reach a target UA, by up to $5\times$5× when using existing FL optimisation strategies, and with a further $3\times$3× improvement when using FedAvg-Adam. We compare MTFL to competing personalised FL algorithms, showing that it is able to achieve the best UA for MNIST and CIFAR10 in all considered scenarios.

In particular, AML-IDS that employ low complexity models for IoT, such as the principal component machine (PCA) method and the one-class support vector machine (1-SVM) method, are inefficient in detecting intrusions when compared to DL-IDS with the two-class neural network (2-NN) method. PCA and 1-SVM AML-IDS suffer from low detection rates compared to DL-IDS. The size of the data set and the number of features or variants in the data set may influence how well PCA and 1-SVM AML-IDS perform compared to DL-IDS. We attribute the low performance and prediction accuracy of the AML-IDS model to an imbalanced data set, a low similarity index between the training data and testing data, and the use of a single-learner model. The intrinsic limitations of the single-learner model have a direct impact on the accuracy of an intelligent IDS. Also, the dissimilarity between testing data and training data leads to an increasingly high rate of false positives (FPs) in AML-IDS than DL-IDS, which have low false alarms and high predictability. In this article, we examine the use of optimization techniques to enhance the performance of single-learner AML-IDS, such as PCA and 1-SVM AML-IDS models for building efficient, scalable, and distributed intelligent IDS for detecting intrusions in IoT. We evaluate these AML-IDS models by tuning hyperparameters and ensemble learning optimization techniques using the Microsoft Azure ML Studio (AMLS) platform and two data sets containing malicious and benign IoT and industrial IoT (IIoT) network traffic.

In this article, we exploit blockchain to propose a new digital twin edge networks framework for enabling flexible and secure digital twin construction. We first develop cooperative federated learning through an access point (AP) to help resource-limited smart devices in constructing digital twin at the network edges belonging to different mobile network operators (MNOs). Then, we propose a model update chain by leveraging directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain to secure both local model updates and global model updates. In order to incentivize the APs to help in local models training for resource-limited smart devices and also encourage the APs to contribute resource in local model update verification, we design an iterative double auction-based joint cooperative federated learning and local model update verification scheme. The optimal unified time for cooperative federated learning and local model update verification is solved to maximize social welfare.

The system implements two functions: working condition detection and remote visually reconstruction of the furnace flame. For the problem of working condition detection, we combine the image features and the smelting electrical currents to train the classifier under semi-supervised learning framework. We also introduce a highly efficient cross-entropy based optimization method for training. For the visualization task, we propose a practical end-to-end solution which can visually simulate the dynamic furnace flame at remote monitoring consoles according to the visual feature of the monitoring video. Finally, we introduce the distributed structure of the monitoring system which consists of a private cloud, an edge server and remote monitoring consoles. The proposed solution can be applicable for various monitoring tasks in industry. Note to Practitioners—This paper introduces an image based solution to the practical problem of condition monitoring of fused magnesium furnace. The solution includes two parts: working condition detection and visualization. First, for the abnormal condition detection problem, most existing approaches use the process monitoring video as the condition predictor. It also assumes that the video data are fully labeled with condition category, which often is not available in practice. This paper suggests a novel approach combining the monitoring video and the smelting electrical currents under semi-supervised learning framework to the development of condition classifier. Experiments show that the detection accuracy is remarkably improved comparing to the approach using monitoring video only. Second, this paper presents a remote visualization solution which enables instant reconstruction of the furnace flame at monitoring consoles using only essential features of the flame. This technique is well suited for situation of real-time remote visual monitoring with very limited network bandwidth. Finally, the condition monitoring system adopts a distributed structure including a private cloud, an edge server and remote monitoring consoles.

However, the real environment is mostly unknown and stochastic, which greatly reduces the practicality of these methods. In this article, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to realize the flocking motion of multi-UAV systems. Considering that the sim-to-real problem restricts the application of DRL to the flocking motion scenario, a digital twin (DT)-enabled DRL training framework is proposed to solve this problem. The DRL model can learn from DT and be quickly deployed on the real-world UAV with the help of DT. Under this training framework, this article proposes an actor–critic DRL algorithm, named behavior-coupling deep deterministic policy gradient (BCDDPG), for the flocking motion problem, which is inspired by the flocking behavior of animals. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of BCDDPG. Simulation results show that BCDDPG achieves a higher average reward and performs better in terms of arrival rate and collision rate compared with the existing methods.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3127873","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572254,61902182); Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9614346","Deep reinforcement learning (DRL);digital twin (DT);flocking motion;multi-UAV systems","Training;Navigation;Computational modeling;Digital twin;Reinforcement learning;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Stochastic processes","","18","","36","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present an attempt at constructing a large-scale dataset for face forgery detection in the near-infrared modality and propose a new forgery detection method based on knowledge distillation named cross-modality knowledge distillation aiming to use a teacher model which is pre-trained on the visible light-based (VIS) big data to guide the student model with a small amount of near-infrared (NIR) data. The proposed near-infrared face forgery dataset, named ForgeryNIR, contains a total of over 50,000 real and fake identities. A number of perturbations are applied to help simulate real-world scenarios. All source images in ForgeryNIR are collected from CASIA NIR-VIS 2.0, and fake images are generated via multiple GAN techniques. The proposed dataset fills the gap of face forgery detection research in the near-infrared modality. A comprehensive study on six representative detection baselines is conducted to evaluate the performance of face forgery detection algorithms in the NIR domain. We further construct a hard testing set, named ForgeryNIR+, which contains forged images that have bypassed existing face forgery detection methods. The proposed datasets will be publicly available and aim to help boost further research on face forgery detection, as well as NIR face detection and recognition.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2022.3146766","Guangxi Natural Science Foundation Program(grant numbers:2021GXNSFDA075011); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2020ZDLGY08-08); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0103202); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61922066,61876142,62036007,62072356); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9693897","Near-infrared face;face forgery detection;deepfake","Face recognition;Forgery;Videos;Faces;Databases;Perturbation methods;Lighting","","14","","50","IEEE","26 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It does not release any carbon emissions to pollute our planet. The wind farms monitoring and power generation prediction is a complex problem due to the unpredictability of wind speed. Consequently, it limits the decision power of the management team to plan the energy consumption in an effective way. Our proposed model solves this challenge by utilizing a 5G-Next Generation-Radio Access Network (5G-NG-RAN) assisted cloud-based digital twins’ framework to virtually monitor wind turbines and form a predictive model to forecast wind speed and predict the generated power. The developed model is based on Microsoft Azure digital twins infrastructure as a 5-dimensional digital twins platform. The predictive modeling is based on a deep learning approach, temporal convolution network (TCN) followed by a non-parametric k-nearest neighbor (kNN) regression. Predictive modeling has two components. First, it processes the univariate time series data of wind to predict its speed. Secondly, it estimates the power generation for each quarter of the year ranges from one week to a whole month (i.e., medium-term prediction) To evaluate the framework the experiments are performed on onshore wind turbines publicly available datasets. The obtained results confirm the applicability of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the comparative analysis with the existing classical prediction models shows that our designed approach obtained better results.

In NFV environment, anomalies occurred in virtual machines (VMs) can be caused by faulty components of their hosting servers or anomaly propagation from other ones. If the performance of VMs degrades, we need to find out the root causes accurately, i.e., locate the exact faulty components, to recover the networks as soon as possible. In this paper, we first use digital twin to establish a virtual instance of the physical network to capture the real-time anomaly-fault dependency relationship. When the network environment changes, transfer learning is leveraged to utilize the learned knowledge of dependency relationship in historical periods to avoid huge time and computation cost of learning from scratch. Assisted by the learned dependency relationship, a dynamic set-covering (DSC) based root caused analysis problem is formulated and modeled with a set of parallel hidden Markov models to capture the dynamics of component states, which can best explain the sequence of anomalous VMs. We use alternating direction method of multipliers to decompose the DSC problem into a set of independent sub-problems and solve it in a distributed fashion. Since the state variables of each component in the DSC problem are coupled between any two successive time epochs, each sub-problem is solved by the Viterbi decoding and an incremental function is designed to construct the feasible solution that covers all anomalous VMs. Simulation results show the availability and superiority of the digital-twin assisted root cause analysis algorithm for NFV environment.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2022.3151249","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071078); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9712649","NFV;root cause analysis;digital twin;transfer learning;dynamic set-covering;hidden Markov models","Hidden Markov models;Digital twin;Anomaly detection;Servers;Real-time systems;Biological system modeling;Costs","","8","","45","IEEE","14 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, full-scale deep neural networks are often too resource-intensive in terms of energy and storage. As a result, the bulk part of the machine learning operation is therefore often carried out on an edge server, where the data is compressed and transmitted. However, compressing data (such as images) leads to transmitting information irrelevant to the supervised task. Another popular approach is to split the deep network between the device and the server while compressing intermediate features. To date, however, such split computing strategies have barely outperformed the aforementioned naive data compression baselines due to their inefficient approaches to feature compression. This paper adopts ideas from knowledge distillation and neural image compression to compress intermediate feature representations more efficiently. Our supervised compression approach uses a teacher model and a student model with a stochastic bottleneck and learnable prior for entropy coding (Entropic Student). We compare our approach to various neural image and feature compression baselines in three vision tasks and found that it achieves better supervised rate-distortion performance while maintaining smaller end-to-end latency.

In the KD framework, however, it is unclear what kind of knowledge is effective and how it is transferred. This paper analyzes a KD process to explore the key factors. In a KD formulation, softmax temperature entangles three main components of student and teacher probabilities and a weight for KD, making it hard to analyze contributions of those factors separately. We disentangle those components so as to further analyze especially the temperature and improve the components respectively. Based on the analysis about temperature and uniformity of the teacher probability, we propose a method, called extractive distillation, for extracting effective knowledge from the teacher model. The extractive KD touches only teacher knowledge, thus being applicable to various KD methods.

Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods attempt to explore the global features by gradually expanding the receptive field, while long-range contextual information is ignored. Vision transformer (ViT) can extract contextual features, but the learning ability of local information is limited, and it has a large computational complexity simultaneously. In this article, an end-to-end method is exploited by employing ViT as an excellent teacher for guiding small networks (ET-GSNet) in the remote sensing image scene classification. In the ET-GSNet, ResNet18 is selected as the student model, which integrates the superiorities of the two models via knowledge distillation (KD), and the computational complexity does not increase. In the KD process, the ViT and ResNet18 are optimized together without independent pretraining, and the learning rate of teacher model gradually decreases until zero, while the weight coefficient of the KD loss module is doubled. Based on the above procedures, dark knowledge from the teacher model can be transferred to the student model more smoothly. Experimental results on the four public remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed ET-GSNet method possesses the superior classification performance compared to some state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In addition, we evaluate the ET-GSNet on a fine-grained ship recognition dataset, and the results show that our method has good generalization for different tasks in terms of some metrics.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3152566","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42071302); Innovation Program for Chongqing Overseas Returnees(grant numbers:cx2019144); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9716120","Convolutional neural network (CNN);high spatial resolution (HSR) images;knowledge distillation (KD);scene classification;vision transformer (ViT)","Remote sensing;Feature extraction;Transformers;Context modeling;Computational modeling;Semantics;Layout","","27","","90","IEEE","17 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This MDT consists of three building blocks in the physical space (namely, Human, Vehicle, and Traffic), and their associated Digital Twins in the digital space. An example cloud–edge architecture is built with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to accommodate the proposed MDT framework and to fulfill its digital functionalities of storage, modeling, learning, simulation, and prediction. A case study of the personalized adaptive cruise control (P-ACC) system is conducted, which integrates the key microservices of all three digital building blocks of the MDT framework: 1) the Human Digital Twin with user management and driver type classification; 2) the Vehicle Digital Twin with cloud-based advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS); and 3) the Traffic Digital Twin with traffic flow monitoring and variable speed limit. Future challenges of the proposed MDT framework are discussed toward the end of the article, including standardization, AI for computing, public or private cloud service, and network heterogeneity.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3156028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9724183","Amazon Web services (AWS);cloud computing;connected vehicles;digital twin;edge computing","Digital twin;Cloud computing;Connected vehicles;Internet of Things;Vehicles;Space vehicles;Computational modeling","","49","","98","IEEE","2 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Considering these issues, we propose a novel Mentor-Student architecture for Patient-Specific seizure detection (MS4PS). It contains a new method of knowledge transferring called mentor-select-for-student, which exploits the knowledge of a mentor model by using this model to select data for training a student model, making it possible to avoid transferring patient data and the negative influence of transferring parameters/structures of pre-trained models. It also contains a new method of active learning, which uses both an experienced mentor model and a quick-learning student model to select high-quality samples for doctors to label. Each of the two models is coupled with a particular sample selection strategy that combines uncertainty/certainty and the distance between the unlabeled samples and labeled seizure samples. The proposed method can quickly train a suitable detector for a patient at his/her first epilepsy diagnosis with the help of: (1) an experienced mentor model that chooses the most category-certain electroencephalography (EEG) data segments; (2) a student model (detector itself) that chooses the most category-uncertain EEG data segments; (3) doctors who label these data segments selected by both the mentor model and student model. By replacing or improving the mentor model and refining the historical models of patients when they come next time, the MS4PS system can be sustainably promoted. The proposed method is tested on the CHB-MIT and NEO datasets, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3158348","Guizhou Science and Technology Department(grant numbers:[2018]1114); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732429","Active learning;epilepsy;mentor-student architecture;patient-specific;transfer learning","Brain modeling;Data models;Electroencephalography;Transfer learning;Medical services;Detectors;Task analysis","","","","28","CCBY","10 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most of the existing anomaly detection models are statically trained on pre-recorded data from a single source, thus making multiple assumptions about the surrounding environment. As a result, their usefulness is limited to controlled scenarios. In this paper, we fuse information from live streams of audio and video data to detect anomalies in the captured environment. We train a deep learning-based teacher-student network using video, image, and audio information. The pre-trained visual network in the teacher model distills its information to the image and audio networks in the student model. Features from image and audio networks are combined and compressed using principal component analysis. Thus, the teacher-student network produces an image-audio-based light-weight joint representation of the data. The data dynamics are learned in a multivariate adaptive Gaussian mixture model. Empirical results from two audio-visual datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of joint representation over single modalities in the adaptive anomaly detection framework.

An increasing attention has been recently given to machine learning (ML) methods for SM retrieval that provide promising performance. Nevertheless, most of them are based on a supervised learning strategies that depend on the used labeled training samples. In fact, they are unaffordable or costly. In this letter, new teacher–student for SM estimation, called (TS-SME), relying on teacher–student (TS) framework using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data, was proposed to estimate SM. The main advantage of this framework is to enroll a large amount of unlabeled data together with a small amount of labeled data. Experiments were carried out on two arid areas in southern Tunisia. The input data include the backscatter coefficient in two-mode polarization ( $\sigma ^{\circ }_{\textrm {VV}}$  and  $\sigma ^{\circ }_{\textrm {VH}}$ ) for Sentinel-1A, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference infrared index (NDII) for Sentinel-2A and in situ measurements. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that TS-SME framework is capable of generating a well-performed student model, with the estimation accuracy is superior to all teacher models [artificial neural network (ANN), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest regressor (RFR), and water cloud model (WCM)].

This paper explores a novel privacy friendly setting to train a multi-organ segmentation model, i.e., learning directly from multiple pre-trained single-organ segmentation models. We formulate it into a special unsupervised ensemble distillation problem. To solve the problem, a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework is proposed, which leverages the soft labels predicted by pre-trained teacher models to train a student model, i.e., the multi-organ segmentation model. Considering the difference of the teachers in task speciality, the pseudo labels for each organ come from the corresponding teacher, and those of the background region are from all teachers. To deal with the problem of unmatched dimensionality between the teacher models and the student model, an output transformation method is introduced. The entire learning process requires only access to pre-trained models and a reasonable set of unsupervised target data, achieving a good balance between the privacy protection and model performance. Experimental results on a widely adopted benchmark dataset have shown the promise of the proposed method.","1945-8452","978-1-6654-2923-8","10.1109/ISBI52829.2022.9761568","Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9761568","Semantic segmentation;multi-organ;knowledge distillation;unsupervised learning","Image segmentation;Privacy;Data privacy;Correlation;Semantics;Biological systems;Predictive models","","2","","11","IEEE","26 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The gap between these heterogeneous models hinder their knowledge transfer and it would be more challenging when the teacher model is from another task. Previous methods view the teacher model as a perfect feature extractor and train the student model to mimic it. While we notice that the teacher model has defect in extracting features of another task samples. To improve knowledge distillation under such situation, we propose Multiple Auxiliary Subspaces (MAS). Most previous methods improve distillation performance by representation alignment, while we resort to the promotion of the teacher model which is more suitable for cross-task distillation. The MAS distills the knowledge in a mutual learning way based on an auxiliary network. Along with the training procedure, the teacher model is improved by the auxiliary network which works as a trainable part of the teacher model and learn the features distribution of target samples from the student model. And this promotion of the teacher model will benefit the student model via the following distillation procedure. We adopt the representation alignment technique, multiple auxiliary networks to further enhance the proposed method. The MAS works well with limited or sufficient labeled target data. If the source data is available, based on it the MAS can construct another auxiliary network to further improve the distillation.

However, most of RGB-D semantic segmentation methods need to acquire the real depth information for segmenting RGB images effectively. Therefore, it is extremely challenging to take full advantage of RGB-D semantic segmentation methods for segmenting RGB images without the depth input. To address this challenge, a general depth removal distillation method is proposed to remove depth dependence from RGB-D semantic segmentation model by knowledge distillation, which can be employed to any CNN-based segmentation network structure. Specifically, a depth-aware convolution is adopted to construct the teacher network for getting sufficient knowledge from RGB-D images. Then according to the structure consistency between depth-aware convolution and general convolution, the teacher network is used to transfer the learned knowledge to the student network with general convolutions by sharing parameters. Next, the student network makes up for the lack of depth in manner of learning by RGB images. Meantime, a Variable Temperature Cross Entropy (VTCE) loss function is proposed to further increase the accuracy of the student model by soft target distillation.

The proposed task can be performed as long as the educational center counts with basic computer equipment and internet connection. This paper presents a bin picker application based on mono and stereo vision to make the classification of cylinders of different colors and sizes and their arrangement in a base by using image processing and depth estimation algorithms. The performance of the classification was measured in terms of the error in millimeters from the difference of the desired and the obtained position. The images used for classification were taken in real life considering the environment conditions, and a digital twin of the bin picker and objects was made. The image classification and the overall instructions that the robot performed were generated on MATLAB, where the data from the real environment captured by cameras was sent. From here, the instructions were sent to URsim, which serves as the robot controller, and the final virtual simulation with the models of the base and cylinders was performed on Kuka-Sim Pro. This approach can then be utilized to implement different assessments based on personal results from simulation activities. As this assessment requires specialized knowledge regarding robotics, computer vision and classification algorithms, this methodology is intended to be applied for university students, at the level that is adequate according to the educational programs of each university.","2165-9567","978-1-6654-4434-7","10.1109/EDUCON52537.2022.9766459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766459","Bin picker;digital twin;classification;computer vision;perception;educational innovation;higher education","Computer vision;Computational modeling;Digital twin;Virtual environments;Estimation;Classification algorithms;Stereo vision","","1","","30","IEEE","11 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As part of developing the IEM method, models satisfying various detection system evaluation requirements were created. In this work, we extend IEM as a digital twin generation technique by representing modeled processes as executable UML Activity Diagrams and tracing solution processes to problem requirements using ontologies. Using the proposed framework, we can rapidly prototype a digital twin of a detection system that can also be imported and executed in systems engineering simulation software tools such as Cameo Enterprise Architecture Simulation Toolkit. Cyber security and threat detection is a continuous process that requires regular maintenance and testing throughout its lifecycle, but there often exists access issues for sensitive and private data and proprietary detection model details to perform adequate test and evaluation activities in the live production environment. To solve this issue, organizations can use a digital twin technique to create a real-time virtual counterpart of the physical system. We describe a method for creating digital twins of live and/or hypothetical insider threat detection enterprises for the purpose of performing test and evaluation activities on continuous monitoring systems that are sensitive to disruptions.

Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. The teacher model utilizes both correct and incorrect predictive labels to guide the optimization of the student model. However, the incorrect predictive labels have a negative influence on the student model. Moreover, it is not enough to rely solely on predictive labels to transfer knowledge. The student model should make full use of the features of the teacher model. To mitigate these issues, we design a JGL approach that exploits the joint guidance of features and the predictive labels. Our method involves two novel components: 1) a guided label refinery module that considers the correct predictions and ignores the incorrect predictions and 2) a channel distillation (CD) module that guides the student model to learn the attention map of each channel from feature maps in the teacher model.

Therefore, we build hierarchical teacher-wise distillation (HTWD) to improve the feature representations of the teacher models trained with middle and tail data, which is achieved by distilling the feature representations of the teacher model trained with head data. Second, we notice that the feature representations of the middle and tail classes cannot be effectively distilled from the teacher to the student since too little middle and tail data can be used to learn. Thus, we propose self-calibrated sampling (SCS) learning that enforces the student to strengthen the learning of the middle and tail data, thereby improving the student’ feature learning ability. Extensive experiments on two widely used DOTA and FGSC-23 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art methods.

These include stringent latency limits, high availability and reliability, as well as deterministic communication behavior. To assure the necessary allocation of re-sources and provisioning of required Quality-of-Service in highly diverse communication systems, a holistic network management approach is needed that can serve all cornerstones of modern industrial networks. More recently, this lead to the development of new adaptive and agile management approaches that imple-ment autonomous and self-organizing manufacturing networks, whereby Machine Learning (ML) methods started to become an integral part for overcoming the limiting factors of practically deploying such systems. Due to the growing complexity of today's networking environments, defining network management policies based on expert knowledge becomes increasingly difficult. ML has evolved as a promising technique to extract knowledge from collected data to enable cognitive network management approaches. This paper reviews past advances in ML applications for zero touch management of heterogeneous industrial communication networks. It illustrates how a network's management life-cycle that is based on digital twin technology can harnesses the potentials of ML to bring the concepts of organic computing and zero-touch cognitive manufacturing within industrial networks closer to reality. Lastly, recent papers that discuss the use of ML approaches for self-x features in Zero-Touch Management (ZTM) network environments are surveyed and relevant open issues are discussed.","","978-1-6654-1086-1","10.1109/WFCS53837.2022.9779183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9779183","network;management;industrial;self-x;hetero-geneous;FCAPS;machine learning;zero-touch","Knowledge engineering;Industrial communication;Machine learning;Quality of service;Heterogeneous networks;Production facilities;Manufacturing","","8","","76","IEEE","26 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing learning-based models for medical image registration consume large GPU memories and long inference time, which is difficult to be deployed in resource-limited diagnosis scenarios. To address this problem, instead of shrinking the model size as in previous works, we turn to reducing the input resolution of existing registration models and boosting their performance through knowledge distillation. Specifically, we propose a cross-resolution distillation (CRD) scheme, which is designed to train low-resolution models under the guidance of corresponding high-resolution models. Nevertheless, due to the resolution gap between features in high/low-resolution models, straightforward distillation is difficult to apply. To overcome this challenge, we first introduce a feature-shifted teacher (FST) to shift and fuse features of high/low-resolution models. Then, we exploit this teacher model to guide the learning of the low-resolution student model with distillation losses on both features and deformation fields. Finally, we only need to use the distilled student model during inference. Experimental results on four 3D medical image datasets demonstrate that the low-resolution models trained through our CRD scheme use fewer than 20% GPU memories and less than 20% inference time while achieving competitive performance compared with corresponding high-resolution models.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3178178","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0700800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62021001); University Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province(grant numbers:GXXT-2019-025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9782430","Medical image registration;knowledge distillation;deep learning","Computational modeling;Strain;Image registration;Deformable models;Three-dimensional displays;Graphics processing units;Medical diagnostic imaging","","14","","57","IEEE","26 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It can be assumed though that the greater the potential to gain real measurement data, the greater the opportunity to improve the overall system model accuracy.This paper develops a model of a previously overlooked but essential part of the engine control system - the measuring chain relating to the closed-loop engine combustion controller. This part of the system performs an essential role to provide real-time data for the engine control loop, to be able to optimize the engine performance on a cylinder-by-cylinder, cycle-by-cycle basis. However, failure of this part of the system can often be impossible to distinguish from an engine fault when there is no knowledge of the system health of the measuring chain.

Many researchers work on developing more intelligence data driven fault-tolerant control techniques instead of traditional ones which need a complete sophisticated model. This paper proposes a learning fault tolerant control of discrete event systems subjected to sensors faults, based on recurrent neural networks. The proposed network has both previous and current sensors signals as inputs and current actuators signals as outputs. The new data driven fault tolerant control replaces the diagnosis and control reconfiguration block function in the traditional one.

Among the variety of model compression and acceleration techniques, Knowledge Distillation(KD) has attracted extensive attention for compressing pre-trained language models. However, the major two challenges for KD are: (i)Transfer more knowledge from the teacher model to student model without scarifying accuracy while accelerating. (ii)Higher training speed of the lightweight model is accompanied by the risk of overfitting due to the noise influence. To address these problems, we propose a novel model based on knowledge distillation, called Theseus-BERT Guided Distill CNN(TBG-disCNN). BERT-of-Theseus [1] is employed as the teacher model and CNN as the student model. Aiming at the inherent noise problem, we propose coordinated CNN-BiLSTM as a parameter-sharing layer for Multi-Task Learning (MTL), in order to capture both regional and long-term dependence information.

In extensive experiments carried out with a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our approach provides accurate detections of moving vehicles and does not require manual annotations. We furthermore show that our model can be used as a teacher to supervise an audio-only detection model. This student model is invariant to illumination changes and thus effectively bridges the domain gap inherent to models leveraging exclusively vision as the predominant modality.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2022.3183931","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:BU 865/10-2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9799537","Computer vision for transportation;deep learning for visual perception;representation learning","Heating systems;Cameras;Detectors;Spectrogram;Microphones;Manganese;Image segmentation","","","","25","IEEE","17 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A fast-forming network with a resource-limited aerial base station (BS) connecting with scattered communities of users is considered. Properly connecting each individual user in the service area is achieved by 1) applying device-to-device (D2D) communication within each community, 2) fairly assigning limited number of channels, and 3) optimally placing the flying BS. Q-learning, a common type of reinforcement learning (RL), is employed for autonomous BS placement. Two optimization objectives for BS placement are considered to maximize the per-user data rate in the worse condition and minimize the total BS transmitted power, respectively. To overcome resource limitations of the aerial BS, the RL training with many iterations is a done in the digital twin (DT) virtual space connected to the physical space via an aerial BS enabled by 6G technology. It is shown that, even the models used in DT is imperfect, nearly-optimal results can be obtained in DT. In particular, compared to RL training 100% in the physical space, a huge number of BS moves can be avoided and significant among of time and energy can be saved.","","978-1-6654-0926-1","10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS54753.2022.9798249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9798249","Beyond 5G(B5G);6G;digital twin (DT);aerial base station (BS);reinforcement learning (RL);Q-learning;Device-to-Device (D2D) communication","6G mobile communication;Training;Base stations;Q-learning;Conferences;Simulation;Device-to-device communication","","2","","14","IEEE","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, like vulnerability inheritance in traditional software reuse, some defects in the teacher model may also be inherited by students, such as well-known adversarial vulnerabilities and backdoors. Re-ducing such defects is challenging since the student is unaware of how the teacher is trained and/or attacked. In this paper, we propose ReMoS, a relevant model slicing technique to reduce defect inheri-tance during transfer learning while retaining useful knowledge from the teacher model. Specifically, ReMoS computes a model slice (a subset of model weights) that is relevant to the student task based on the neuron coverage information obtained by profiling the teacher model on the student task. Only the relevant slice is used to fine-tune the student model, while the irrelevant weights are retrained from scratch to minimize the risk of inheriting defects. Our experi-ments on seven DNN defects, four DNN models, and eight datasets demonstrate that ReMoS can reduce inherited defects effectively (by 63% to 86% for CV tasks and by 40% to 61 % for NLP tasks) and efficiently with minimal sacrifice of accuracy (3% on average).","1558-1225","978-1-4503-9221-1","10.1145/3510003.3510191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793881","Program slicing;deep neural networks;relevant slicing","Deep learning;Computational modeling;Transfer learning;Neurons;Task analysis;Software reusability;Biological neural networks","","","","73","","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This system is a dialogue-based Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that allows the tutor and student with mixed-initiative and natural language to ask each other questions concerning the basic computer knowledge in the Computer Basics course. CQACD is based on constructivist principles and encourages the learner to construct knowledge rather than merely receiving knowledge, which has the following characteristics: (a) this system employs a domain ontology with rich semantic relationships to model the basic computer knowledge and build up a concept-centric knowledge model, (b) uses a limited number of 80 input templates with description logics to acquire the intention of questions posed by students, (c) a textual entailment algorithm with semantic technologies is proposed to match the input template and assess the student’s contribution to improve the flexibility of the system, and (d) an ontology-driven dialogue management mechanism is proposed, which can quickly form the conversational content and conversational sequence. The experimental results show that CQACD can replace the teachers’ tutoring in large classes and can promote the learning of poor students in large classes better than teachers can. The paper reveals that the domain ontology with rich semantic relationships plays an important role in the Concept Question Answer System (CQAS). It can model CQAS’s discipline knowledge, provide structured domain knowledge for student model, template design and matching, and provide basic architectural architecture for dialogue management.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3185400","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62062012,61967003); Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi of China(grant numbers:2020GXNSFAA159082); National Social Science Fund of China(grant numbers:17BTY063); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9802991","Dialogue-based ITSs;domain ontology;question-answering system;template logics;ontology learning;NLP;answer reasoning;dialogue management","Ontologies;Semantics;Natural languages;Libraries;Cognition;Motion pictures;Knowledge engineering","","1","","48","CCBY","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to classic automation systems working without considering dynamic environment parameters, for an accurate calculation, it is not adequate to use only the information obtained from product specifications or experiments. Rather, this calculation should be done dynamically. For this reason, we used the Markov model as the reliability calculation method, since it is a powerful state-based analytical technique considering the dynamic aspects concerning testing and maintenance. This is the need to add dynamism to the system. This paper proposes a novel approach using the concept of intelligent Digital Twin (iDT) for the dynamic calculation of the reliability of industrial automation systems. Moreover, we evaluate our concept as a prototype.

Thereby, the understanding of wire behavior plays a key role. In particular geometric wire bending behavior significantly influences the planning and execution of winding trajectories. Thus, building on previous work, this paper takes further steps toward a data-driven empirical approach to modeling geometric wire bending behavior. The overarching goal is to provide an efficient and comprehensive model of wire bending geometry as a function of wire tensile force and wire exit angles at the needle outlet. Spline models generated with the help of a purpose-built test bench with a dedicated image processing pipeline serve as the basis for a simplified modeling approach. The proposed model is based on circular arcs with tangential linear functions, allowing the wire bending geometry to be defined with only three parameters. Qualitative analyses of the resulting model behavior and quantitative investigations of the model errors show accurate approximation results and confirm the suitability of the developed method.","2377-5483","978-1-6654-0560-7","10.1109/ITEC53557.2022.9814041","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9814041","wire forming;manufacturing;production systems;digital twin;machine learning","Geometry;Analytical models;Wires;Windings;Production;Bending;Needles","","1","","27","IEEE","7 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the uneven distribution of vehicles in the networks and the dynamics of heterogeneous wireless links, how to optimize the connection along the vehicle's trip between the vehicle and its DT to achieve the lowest cost (i.e., delay and energy consumption) is a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we investigate the joint network selection and power level allocation problem in the data synchronization issue between vehicles and DTs in the heterogeneous access networks. In order to better use the information shared by DT to facilitate the data synchronization process, we propose a learning-based heterogeneous network selection scheme in DT empowered IoV. First, we consider the data divided into blocks and model the data synchronization problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to minimize the long-term cost in terms of the delay and energy consumption. Based on the information obtained from the digital twin communications, we develop an actor-critic learning approach to solve the MDP problem with the block-level state method, and obtain the optimal network selection strategy for the vehicles. In addition, we explore the capability of digital twins by applying transfer learning. The vehicles are divided into two types, i.e., learner vehicles and expert vehicles, so that the knowledge can be transferred from the expert vehicles to the learner vehicles to effectively improve the learning efficiency and decrease the data synchronization latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme can effectively find the optimal network selection policy and achieve the fast convergence and better performance compared with existing related approaches.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3190941","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1808207,62171352); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9830070","Digital twins;internet of vehicles;transfer learning","Synchronization;Digital twins;Costs;Heterogeneous networks;Data models;Wireless fidelity;Wireless communication","","4","","25","IEEE","14 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We find that the standard KD method performs the knowledge alignment on an individual sample indirectly via class prototypes and neglects the structural knowledge between different samples, namely, knowledge correlation. Although recent contrastive learning-based distillation methods can be decomposed into knowledge alignment and correlation, their correlation objectives undesirably push apart representations of samples from the same class, leading to inferior distillation results. To improve the distillation performance, in this work, we propose a novel knowledge correlation objective and introduce the dual-level knowledge distillation (DLKD), which explicitly combines knowledge alignment and correlation together instead of using one single contrastive objective. We show that both knowledge alignment and correlation are necessary to improve the distillation performance. In particular, knowledge correlation can serve as an effective regularization to learn generalized representations. The proposed DLKD is task-agnostic and model-agnostic, and enables effective knowledge transfer from supervised or self-supervised pretrained teachers to students.

As markets shift toward mass customization and new service delivery models, the digital representation has become more adaptive and agile by forming digital twin networks (DTNs). The DTN institutes a real-time single source of truth everywhere. However, there are several issues preventing DTNs from further application, including centralized processing, data falsification, privacy leakage, lack of incentive mechanism, and so on. To make DTN better meet the ever changing demands, we propose a novel block-chain-enabled adaptive asynchronous federated learning (FedTwin) paradigm for privacy-preserving and decentralized DTNs. We design Proof-of-Federalism (PoF), which is a tailor-made consensus algorithm for autonomous DTNs. In each DT's local training phase, generative adversarial network enhanced differential privacy is used to protect the privacy of local model parameters, while a modified Isolation Forest is deployed to filter out the falsified DTs. In the global aggregation phase, an improved Markov decision process is leveraged to select optimal DTs to achieve adaptive asynchronous aggregation while providing a rollback mechanism to redact the falsified global models.

It is still a challenge to expect an overall high detection accuracy for all classes under different scenarios given the dataset sparsity. To mitigate this challenge, this article proposes a novel method called semi-supervised learning and progressive distillation (SPD), which uses semi-supervised learning (SSL) and knowledge distillation to improve label efficiency. The SPD uses two big backbones to hand the unlabeled/labeled input data augmented by the periodic IO augmentation (PA). Then the backbones are compressed using progressive distillation (PD). Precisely, PA periodically shifts the data augmentation operations between the input and output of the big backbone, aiming to improve the network’s generalization of the unseen and unlabeled data. Using the big backbone can benefit from large-scale augmented data better than the small one. And two backbones are trained by the data scale and ratio-sensitive loss (data-loss). It solves the over-flat caused by the large-scale unlabeled data from PA and helps the big backbone prevent overfitting on the limited-scale labeled data. Hence, using the PA and data loss during SSL training dramatically improves the label efficiency. Next, the trained big backbone set as the teacher CNN is progressively distilled to obtain a small student model, referenced as PD. PD mitigates the problem that student CNN performance degrades when the gap between the student and the teacher is oversized. Extensive experiments are conducted on the indoor datasets SUN RGB-D and ScanNetV2 and outdoor dataset KITTI. Using only 50% labeled data and a 27% smaller model size, SPD performs 0.32 higher than the fully supervised VoteNetqi2019deep which is adopted as our backbone. Besides, using only 2% labeled data, compared to the other fully supervised backbone PV-RCNNshi2020pv, SPD accomplishes a similar accuracy (84.1 and 84.83) and 30% less inference time.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3193614","International Training Program for Outstanding Young Scientific Research Talents in 2019 of Guangdong Provincial Department of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9845376","3-D detection;data augmentation;knowledge distillation;semi-supervised learning (SSL)","Training;Data models;Semisupervised learning;Point cloud compression;Object detection;Detectors;Adaptation models","","","","","IEEE","29 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, performance of such ASR system is inefficient for children speech, due to numerous acoustic variability in children speech and scarcity of resources. In this paper, we propose to use the unlabeled data extensively to develop ASR system for low resourced children speech. State-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 is the baseline ASR technique used here. The baseline’s performance is further enhanced with the intuition of Noisy Student Teacher (NST) learning. The proposed technique is not only limited to introducing the use of soft labels (i.e., word-level transcription) of unlabeled data, but also adapts the learning of teacher model or preceding student model, which results in reduction of the redundant training significantly. To that effect, a detailed analysis is reported in this paper, as there is a difference in teacher and student learning. In ASR experiments, character-level tokenization was used and hence, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss was used for fine-tuning. Due to computational limitations, experiments are performed with approximately 12 hours of training, and 5 hours of development and test data was used from standard My Science Tutor (MyST) corpus. The baseline wav2vec 2.0 achieves 34% WER, while relatively 10% of performance was improved using the proposed approach.

Therefore, in view of the above problems, the project has built an intelligent control system of waterworks flocculant drugs based on big data by comprehensively using big data, digital twin, Internet of Things and deep learning, so as to realize the precise dosage of flocculant.","","978-1-6654-9991-0","10.1109/ICAICA54878.2022.9844466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9844466","digital twin;water plant to add medicine;cloud edge collaboration;big data","Drugs;Deep learning;Purification;Production;Water quality;Big Data;Control systems","","","","5","IEEE","5 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, with the development of artificial intelligence, it is still difficult to establish a computer-aided diagnosis model for high myopia with young children as research objects, mainly because 1) it is very difficult to collect labeled fundus images, and there is no large amount of such data that can be freely accessed; 2) hard samples which have clinical significance for population screening and diagnosis are rare and indistinguishable. To solve these problems, we propose a high myopia detection model on fundus images based on curriculum learning. We design a dual-curriculum generation module, which aims to use the expert model to endow the curriculum with new training indicators so that the student model can gradually and robustly identify hard samples. Compared with the baseline, our framework significantly improves the convergence speed of the training process and achieves the best performance during testing.

A precise online estimate of the battery’s State of Health (SoH) has the ability to resolve some of these issues. However, computing the SoH on EVs is computationally intensive, necessitating expensive onboard integrated electronics and rapidly draining the EV battery. In addition, the SoH estimating algorithms currently available do not utilise incremental battery usage data. This research presents a digital twin of the EV battery as a solution to the difficulty of onboard computation for incremental SoH prediction.

One important aspect of situation awareness is the correct and thorough monitoring of air pollutants. The monitoring is threatened by sensor faults, power or network failures, or other hazards leading to missing or incorrect data transmission. For this reason, in this work we propose two complementary approaches for predicting missing sensor data and a combined technique for detecting outliers. The proposed solution can enhance the performance of low-cost sensor systems, closing the gap of missing measurements due to network unavailability, detecting drift and outliers thus paving the way to its use as an alert system for reportable events. The techniques have been deployed and tested also in a low power microcontroller environment, verifying the suitability of such a computing power to perform the inference locally, leading the way to an edge implementation of a virtual sensor digital twin.","","978-1-6654-8828-0","10.23919/SpliTech55088.2022.9854299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9854299","LSTM;Random Forest;Machine learning;Environmental data","Performance evaluation;Microcontrollers;Soft sensors;Image edge detection;Time series analysis;Machine learning;Sensor systems;Climate change","","","","20","","19 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lately, Near-human accuracy in automated sleep staging has been achievable by Deep Learning (DL) based approaches, enabling multi-fold progress in this area. However, An extensive and expensive clinical setup is required for EEG based sleep staging. Additionally, the EEG setup being obtrusive in nature and requiring an expert for setup adds to the inconvenience of the subject under study, making it adverse in the point of care setting. An unobtrusive and more suitable alternative to EEG is Electrocardiogram (ECG). Unsurprisingly, compared to EEG in sleep staging, its performance remains sub-par. In order to take advantage of both the modalities, transferring knowledge from EEG to ECG is a reasonable approach, ultimately boosting the performance of ECG based sleep staging. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a promising notion in DL that shares knowledge from a superior performing but usually more complex teacher model to an inferior but compact student model. Building upon this concept, a cross-modality KD framework assisting features learned through models trained on EEG to improve ECG-based sleep staging performance is proposed. Additionally, to better understand the distillation approach, extensive experimentation on the independent modules of the proposed model was conducted. Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) dataset consisting of 200 subjects was utilized for this study. The results from the proposed model for weighted-F1-score in 3-class and 4-class sleep staging showed a 13.40 % and 14.30 % improvement, respectively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of KD for single-channel ECG based sleep staging's performance enhancement in 3-class (W-R-N) and 4-class (W-R-L-D) classification.","","978-1-6654-8299-8","10.1109/MeMeA54994.2022.9856508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9856508","Sleep Staging;Deep Learning;Knowledge Distillation;EEG;ECG","Deep learning;Analytical models;Sleep;Point of care;Electrocardiography;Brain modeling;Boosting","","1","","14","IEEE","22 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach overcomes limitations of previous methods which make them dependent on clean in-domain target signals and thus, sensitive to any domain mismatch between train and test samples. RemixIT is based on a continuous self-training scheme in which a pre-trained teacher model on out-of-domain data infers estimated pseudo-target signals for in-domain mixtures. Then, by permuting the estimated clean and noise signals and remixing them together, we generate a new set of bootstrapped mixtures and corresponding pseudo-targets which are used to train the student network. Vice-versa, the teacher periodically refines its estimates using the updated parameters of the latest student models. Experimental results on multiple speech enhancement datasets and tasks not only show the superiority of our method over prior approaches but also showcase that RemixIT can be combined with any separation model as well as be applied towards any semi-supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation task.

These represent a significant drawback when attempting to learn the underlying data manifold. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop better ways of obtaining generalization and representation of the underlying manifold. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to DML that we call Guided Deep Metric Learning, a novel architecture oriented to learning more compact clusters, improving generalization under distributional shifts in DML. This novel architecture consists of two independent models: A multi-branch master model, inspired from a Few-Shot Learning (FSL) perspective, generates a reduced hypothesis space based on prior knowledge from labeled data, which guides or regularizes the decision boundary of a student model during training under an offline knowledge distillation scheme. Experiments have shown that the proposed method is capable of a better manifold generalization and representation to up to 40% improvement (Recall@1, CIFAR10), using guidelines suggested by Musgrave et al. to perform a more fair and realistic comparison, which is currently absent in the literature.","2160-7516","978-1-6654-8739-9","10.1109/CVPRW56347.2022.00154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9857203","","Measurement;Manifolds;Training;Analytical models;Adaptation models;Visualization;Computer architecture","","4","","44","IEEE","23 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel approach to complement self-supervised pretraining via an auxiliary pretraining phase, based on knowledge similarity distillation, auxSKD, for better generalisation with a significantly smaller amount of video data, e.g. Kinetics-100 rather than Kinetics-400. Our method deploys a teacher network that iteratively distils its knowledge to the student model by capturing the similarity information between segments of unlabelled video data. The student model meanwhile solves a pretext task by exploiting this prior knowledge. We also introduce a novel pretext task, Video Segment Pace Prediction or VSPP, which requires our model to predict the playback speed of a randomly selected segment of the input video to provide more reliable self-supervised representations. Our experimental results show superior results to the state of the art on both UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets when pretraining on K100 in apple-to-apple comparisons.

EFDLS consists of a central server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run different TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components: a feature-based student–teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM) scheme. For each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its teacher’s hidden layers to its student’s hidden layers via knowledge distillation, where the teacher and student have identical network structures. For each connected user, its student model’s hidden layers’ weights are uploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the server, with the least square distance (LSD) used to measure the similarity between the weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected user such that the user’s and its partner’s weights are the closest among all the weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user’s and its partner’s weights to these two users which then load the received weights to their teachers’ hidden layers. Experimental results show that compared with a number of state-of-the-art federated learning (FL) algorithms, our proposed EFDLS wins 20 out of 44 standard UCR2018 datasets and achieves the highest mean accuracy (70.14%) on these datasets.

When a user has multiple tasks to offload and only one task can be transmitted to server at a time, while server processes tasks according to the transmission order, the problem is NP-hard. However, it is difficult for traditional optimization methods to quickly obtain the optimal solution, while approaches based on reinforcement learning face with the challenge of excessively large action space and slow convergence. In this paper, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-assisted RL-based task scheduling method in order to improve the performance and convergence of the RL. We use DT to simulate the results of different decisions made by the agent, so that one agent can try multiple actions at a time, or, similarly, multiple agents can interact with environment in parallel in DT. In this way, the exploration efficiency of RL can be significantly improved via DT, and thus RL can converges faster and local optimality is less likely to happen. Particularly, two algorithms are designed to made task scheduling decisions, i.e., DT-assisted asynchronous Q-learning (DTAQL) and DT-assisted exploring Q-learning (DTEQL). Simulation results show that both algorithms significantly improve the convergence speed of Q-learning by increasing the exploration efficiency.","2577-2465","978-1-6654-8243-1","10.1109/VTC2022-Spring54318.2022.9860495","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860495","task scheduling;digital twin;reinforcement learning;exploration efficiency","Vehicular and wireless technologies;Q-learning;Simulation;Optimization methods;Quality of service;Space-air-ground integrated networks;Scheduling","","6","","11","IEEE","25 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, medical data involves mass patient privacy, and datasets of different medical institutions cannot be directly shared due to privacy protection. So medical data often exists in the form of data islands, which makes it difficult for most existing prediction models to complete disease prediction. In this paper, a digital twin assisted efficient clustering Federated Learning (FL) algorithm for disease prediction is proposed. It can break data islands to predict diseases on the premise of privacy security. Firstly, we design an efficient clustering Federated Learning with Client Selection (FLCS) protocol based on heterogeneity and contribution to improve the training efficiency and prediction accuracy. Secondly, we use digital twin to assist the FLCS protocol to carry out large-scale prediction. In addition, the shapley value introduced in the calculation of client contribution makes the model interpretable and enhances the reliability of prediction results.

As the concept of HDT is new, conventional connectivity schemes cannot meet the unique requirements of HDT in terms of reliability, security and privacy. This paper thus proposes an edge-assisted connectivity scheme for HDT and adopts an integrated blockchain and federated learning techniques to ensure security and privacy. To minimize long-term average connectivity cost, we formulated the connectivity problem as a Markov decision process and adopted the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to learn the optimal connectivity policy in terms of connectivity cost. The obtained results were then compared with the conventional deep Q-network-based solution. The results show that the proposed DDPG-based connectivity solution is feasible to perform the connectivity process better by optimally allocating system resources, thus reducing the overall connectivity cost, while ensuring data security and privacy.","2577-2465","978-1-6654-8243-1","10.1109/VTC2022-Spring54318.2022.9860619","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860619","Artificial intelligence;blockchain;edge;ehealth;human digital twin","Privacy;Vehicular and wireless technologies;Costs;Energy resources;Data security;Medical services;Markov processes","","7","","17","IEEE","25 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these methods cannot work for Incremental Implicitly-Refined Classification (IIRC), an incremental learning extension where the incoming classes could have two granularity levels, a superclass label and a subclass label. This is because the previously learned superclass knowledge may be occupied by the sub-class knowledge learned sequentially. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation (MTKD) strategy. To preserve the subclass knowledge, we use the last model as a general teacher to distill the previous knowledge for the student model. To preserve the superclass knowledge, we use the initial model as a superclass teacher to distill the superclass knowledge as the initial model contains abundant superclass knowledge. However, distilling knowledge from two teacher models could result in the student model making some redundant predictions. We further propose a post-processing mechanism, called as Top-k prediction restriction to reduce the redundant predictions.

To explore new methods for training, the combined use of vision-based location tracking, motion sensing, and virtual ultrasound generation methods was studied in this work to offer a more low-cost and intuitive interaction system for virtual ultrasound scanning. The feasibility of the proposed workflow was verified by a user study on simple tasks and a clinical evaluation on a virtual ultrasound examination of three fetal heart specimens. As a result, the proposed interaction device facilitated virtual ultrasound examination by making it more efficient and intuitive, according to objective and subjective measurements. Therefore, while virtual ultrasound provides great data extensibility, the proposed device provides a smooth interaction, making the system simple and cost-effective for the end user.

Hence, when properly applied, it leads to an improvement in process understanding, production planning, quality control, and predictive maintenance. Despite these merits, the adaptability and reliability of condition monitoring at the production field level are limited by the modeling uncertainties due to the rapidly changing industrial environment driven by dynamic customer demands. This study presents a novel strategy to overcome these shortcomings by employing machine internal signals and prior knowledge-embedded machine learning techniques. A concept of incorporating production domain-specific physical models and logical rules into generalized data-driven methods is proposed. A hybrid learning force model based on machine internal signals was constructed. As a result, the soft sensor encompasses stochastic effects that are neglected in the existing model and estimates the reliability of the modeled findings. Prospectively, this allows for online parametrization of the model within dynamically changing conditions.

However, medical image data are more expensive and time-consuming to obtain than ordinary image data. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised method named CAU for medical image segmentation, which can easily use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to segment 2D images. The network learns through a combination of common supervision losses for labeled data and losses for unlabeled data. Specifically, we augment the unlabeled data strongly and weakly and send them to the student model and the teacher model respectively. We take full advantage of unlabeled data learning through a novel combination of minimizing the difference between network predictions for different data augmentation processing scenarios and using an unsupervised loss of min-entropy on the outputs of the two networks. In order to improve the regularization effect, we use the teacher-student model to optimize the teacher model by averaging the student model weights.

With the advance of machine learning (ML) and digital maps, i.e., digital twins, we have a big opportunity to learn the propagation environment and design novel methods to derive and report CSI. In this work, we propose to combine untrained neural networks (UNNs) and conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) for MIMO channel recreation based on prior knowledge. The UNNs learn the prior-CSI for some locations which are used to build the input to a cGAN. Based on the prior-CSI estimates, their locations and the location of the desired channel, the cGAN is trained to output the channel expected at the desired location. This combined approach can be used for low overhead CSI reporting as, after training, we only need to report the desired location. Our results show that our CSI recreation method is successful in modelling the wireless channel under different configurations of prior-CSI spatial sampling. In addition, the results consider a real world measurement campaign for indoor line of sight and non-line of sight channels. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) achieved by our CSI recreation is better than the SNR reported by the measured campaign providers. Moreover, our CSI recreation provides means for low overhead CSI reporting as the UNN structure is underparameterized compared to the full explicit CSI, and only the desired location is needed for the cGAN to recreate the desired CSI.","2644-125X","","10.1109/OJCOMS.2022.3208323","German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(grant numbers:16KIS1184 (FunKI)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9897088","Channel estimation;channel interpolation;UNN;cGAN;digital twin","Channel estimation;Wireless communication;Digital twins;MIMO communication;Interpolation;Data models;Generative adversarial networks","","2","","34","CCBYNCND","21 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, the combustion process is managed rather inefficiently, and steam outputs and emission levels are not optimal. This article investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) can help enhance process automation and, thus, optimize the combustion process, e.g., by making more frequent and diverse interventions. An RL agent is trained via trial and error with a reward function that includes the optimization criteria. Since the actual equipment, i.e., the real WIP, cannot be used as the training environment, a digital twin is built using original plant data and a neural network. The RL agent is then trained in this offline environment with the deep Q-network algorithm. First, our work demonstrates that a digital twin of a WIP can be built in a data-driven way. Second, we show that the RL agent outperforms the human operator.

The two systems (physical and digital) exist side by side, sharing all the inputs and operations using real-time data communications and information transfer. With the incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3D models, next generation mobile communications (5G/6G), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), distributed computing, Transfer Learning (TL), and electronic sensors, the digital/virtual counterpart of the real-world system is able to provide seamless monitoring, analysis, evaluation and predictions. The DT offers a platform for the testing and analysing of complex systems, which would be impossible in traditional simulations and modular evaluations. However, the development of this technology faces many challenges including the complexities in effective communication and data accumulation, data unavailability to train Machine Learning (ML) models, lack of processing power to support high fidelity twins, the high need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and the absence of standardized development methodologies and validation measures.

At the KC, the student network aims to learn the comprehensive bad weather removal problem from multiple well-trained teacher networks where each of them is specialized in a specific bad weather removal problem. To accomplish this process, a novel collaborative knowledge transfer is proposed.

As a popular semi-supervised learning method, the teacher-student framework (a student model is supervised by the pseudo labels from a teacher model) has also yielded a large accuracy gain in cross-domain object detection. However, it suffers from the domain shift and generates many low-quality pseudo labels (e.g., false positives), which leads to sub-optimal performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose a teacher-student framework named Adaptive Teacher (AT) which leverages domain adversarial learning and weak-strong data augmentation to address the domain gap. Specifically, we employ feature-level adversarial training in the student model, allowing features derived from the source and target domains to share similar distributions. This process ensures the student model produces domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we apply weak-strong augmentation and mutual learning between the teacher model (taking data from the target domain) and the student model (taking data from both domains). This enables the teacher model to learn the knowledge from the student model without being biased to the source domain. We show that AT demonstrates superiority over existing approaches and even Oracle (fully-supervised) models by a large margin.

In contrast, we empirically show that a simple knowledge distillation technique is enough to significantly narrow down the teacher-student performance gap. We directly reuse the discriminative classifier from the pre-trained teacher model for student inference and train a student encoder through feature alignment with a single ℓ2 loss. In this way, the student model is able to achieve exactly the same performance as the teacher model provided that their extracted features are perfectly aligned. An additional projector is developed to help the student encoder match with the teacher classifier, which renders our technique applicable to various teacher and student architectures.

Directly employing previous distillation approaches yields inferior results due to the intrinsic challenges of point cloud, i.e., sparsity, randomness and varying density. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we propose the Point-to-Voxel Knowledge Distillation (PVD), which transfers the hidden knowledge from both point level and voxel level. Specifically, we first leverage both the pointwise and voxelwise output distillation to complement the sparse supervision signals. Then, to better exploit the structural information, we divide the whole point cloud into several supervoxels and design a difficulty-aware sampling strategy to more frequently sample supervoxels containing less-frequent classes and faraway objects. On these supervoxels, we propose inter-point and inter-voxel affinity distillation, where the similarity information between points and voxels can help the student model better capture the structural information of the surrounding environment. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular LiDAR segmentation benchmarks, i.e., nuScenes [3] and SemanticKITTI [1]. On both benchmarks, our PVD-consistently outperforms previous distillation approaches by a large margin on three representative backbones, i.e., Cylinder3D [36], [37], SPVNAS [25] and MinkowskiNet [5].

It is an important step toward reducing laborious human supervision. Most existing works first pretrain a model on captioned images covering many novel classes and then finetune it on limited base classes with mask annotations. However, the high-level textual information learned from caption pretraining alone cannot effectively encode the details required for pixelwise segmentation. To address this, we propose a cross-modal pseudo-labeling framework, which generates training pseudo masks by aligning word semantics in captions with visual features of object masks in images. Thus, our framework is capable of labeling novel classes in captions via their word semantics to self-train a student model. To account for noises in pseudo masks, we design a robust student model that selectively distills mask knowledge by estimating the mask noise levels, hence mitigating the adverse impact of noisy pseudo masks.

Despite the promising results, the label mismatch problem is not yet fully explored in the previous works, leading to severe confirmation bias during self-training. In this paper, we delve into this problem and propose a simple yet effective LabelMatch framework from two different yet complementary perspectives, i.e., distribution-level and instance-level. For the former one, it is reasonable to approximate the class distribution of the unlabeled data from that of the labeled data according to Monte Carlo Sampling. Guided by this weakly supervision cue, we introduce a re-distribution mean teacher, which leverages adaptive label-distribution-aware confidence thresholds to generate unbiased pseudo labels to drive student learning. For the latter one, there exists an overlooked label assignment ambiguity problem across teacher-student models. To remedy this issue, we present a novel label assignment mechanism for self-training framework, namely proposal self-assignment, which injects the proposals from student into teacher and generates accurate pseudo labels to match each proposal in the student model accordingly. Experiments on both MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC datasets demonstrate the considerable superiority of our proposed framework to other state-of-the-arts.

With growing use cases of model reuse and distillation, there is a need to also study transfer of interpretability from one model to another. We present Proto2Proto, a novel method to transfer interpretability of one prototypical part network to another via knowledge distillation. Our approach aims to add interpretability to the “dark” knowledge transferred from the teacher to the shallower student model. We propose two novel losses: “Global Explanation” loss and “Patch-Prototype Correspondence” loss to facilitate such a transfer. Global Explanation loss forces the student prototypes to be close to teacher prototypes, and Patch-Prototype Cor-respondence loss enforces the local representations of the student to be similar to that of the teacher. Further, we propose three novel metrics to evaluate the student's proximity to the teacher as measures of interpretability transfer in our settings. We qualitatively and quantitatively demon-strate the effectiveness of our method on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets.

Due to inherent sensor characteristics, Radar performs well under extreme weather conditions (snow, rain, fog) that significantly degrade camera and Lidar. Recently, a few works have developed vehicle detection methods fusing Lidar and Radar signals, i.e., MVD-Net. However, these models are typically developed under the assumption that the models always have access to two error-free sensor streams. If one of the sensors is unavailable or missing, the model may fail catastrophically. To mitigate this problem, we propose the Self-Training Multimodal Vehicle Detection Network (ST-MVDNet) which leverages a Teacher-Student mutual learning framework and a simulated sensor noise model used in strong data augmentation for Lidar and Radar. We show that by (1) enforcing output consistency between a Teacher network and a Student network and by (2) introducing missing modalities (strong augmentations) during training, our learned model breaks away from the error-free sensor assumption. This consistency enforcement enables the Student model to handle missing data properly and improve the Teacher model by updating it with the Student model's exponential moving average. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed learning framework for multi-modal detection is able to better handle missing sensor data during inference. Furthermore, our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance (5% gain) on the Oxford Radar Robotcar dataset under various evaluation settings.","2575-7075","978-1-6654-6946-3","10.1109/CVPR52688.2022.00099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9879704","Recognition: detection;categorization;retrieval; Navigation and autonomous driving; Representation learning","Training;Meteorological radar;Laser radar;Vehicle detection;Computational modeling;Snow;Radar detection","","11","","44","IEEE","27 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome the limitation, online knowledge distillation is proposed to perform one-stage distillation when the teacher is unavailable. Recent researches on online knowledge distillation mainly focus on the design of the distillation objective, including attention or gate mechanism. Instead, in this work, we focus on the design of the global architecture and propose Tree-Structured Auxiliary online knowledge distillation (TSA), which adds more parallel peers for layers close to the output hierarchically to strengthen the effect of knowledge distillation. Different branches construct different views of the inputs, which can be the source of the knowledge. The hierarchical structure implies that the knowledge transfers from general to task-specific with the growth of the layers. Extensive experiments on 3 computer vision and 4 natural language processing datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without bells and whistles.

But existing online distillation methods have several drawbacks, such as unavailable teacher models and the lack of diversity among student models. These hinder the further improvement of network performance. In this work, we propose a new online knowledge distillation technique that trains diverse architecture auxiliary peers to enhance the final effect of knowledge distillation. We propose a Multi-Architecture Peers (MAP) mechanism, which enhances student models to learn diverse features and delivers a powerful ensemble result. Furthermore, we introduce a Feature Learning Module (FLM) that efficiently learns rich semantic information by combing feature maps generated from the last block of student models and generates precise weights for each student model.

Experiments of the regression of bilateral joint angles on the legs (hip, knee, and ankle) are carried out using the MoBI dataset in a subject-specific manner.

The coupling among different resources and the impact of UT mobility create challenges in resource management. To address the challenges, we develop digital twin (DT) empowered network planning with two elements, i.e., multi-resource reservation and resource reservation reconfiguration. First, DTs are designed for collecting UT status data, based on which UTs are grouped according to their mobility patterns. Second, an algorithm is proposed to customize resource reservation for different groups to satisfy their different resource demands.

Algorithms based on deep learning have been widely used in the field of sewage pipeline inspection, but these models have a large number of parameters and are computationally time-consuming. Edge or embedded devices with weak GPUs cannot accept the time and storage costs of these large models.

High-temperature distillation allows the student model to obtain dark knowledge from the pre-trained, well-performing teacher model, which is combined with ground truth (GT) for training. Experiments show that KD is effective. By adjusting the KD hyperparameters, the classification accuracy of the student model is improved by 1.41%, and the F1-score is improved by 1.12%.

The existing researchers have proposed many models with lightweight structures, but their performance still has a gap compared with the deep model. A promising approach to optimize the lightweight model is knowledge distillation (KD), which can be viewed as knowledge transfer from the teacher model. However, the existing KD approaches have some issues. On one hand, offline distillation methods usually ignore the interactive learning between the student model and the teacher model. On the other hand, knowledge transfer does not consider instance property. This offline distillation strategy without property perception may not suitable for multiscale, diverse, and complex RS instances and results in a suboptimum training status. In this article, we propose a dynamic interactive learning (DIL) framework for optimizing RS lightweight detectors. First, we propose an instance interaction learning module. It calculates the value of every instance in the batch of the teacher and student prediction by each model’s real-time state and instance property. Then according to the DIL thought, we facilitate the low-quality instance to learn from the high-quality one whether it is from the teacher or student model. Moreover, we also propose the instance property perception (IPP) strategy that weighs the distillation knowledge of instances according to their feature, category, and location property. In the proposed DIL framework, both the teacher and student models are trained together and it is cost-free in the testing phase. Extensive experiments on three RS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the DIL.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3215146","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171436); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921272","Knowledge distillation;lightweight model;object detection;remote sensing (RS) imagery","Task analysis;Detectors;Remote sensing;Object detection;Training;Real-time systems;Feature extraction","","2","","40","IEEE","17 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our proposed framework contains three stages: self-supervised pre-training, supervised training, and knowledge distillation. Specifically, a feature encoder is firstly trained in a self-supervised manner with a large number of unlabeled samples through a momentum contrastive mechanism. Secondly, a fully-connected classifier on top of the feature encoder is trained in a supervised manner with a small amount of labeled samples to build a teacher model. Finally, a compact student model is trained with the help of the teacher model using knowledge distillation, in order to avoid overfitting to labeled data and have better generalizability on mismatched datasets.

A common requirement for such systems is to detect objects in the scene and predict their pose either for building a map, for navigation, or for manipulation purposes. Predicting segmentation masks for the objects is usually helpful for accurate object localization. In robotic manipulation however, the objects of interest can often have complicated geometries or there can be several objects in the scene simultaneously. This makes the manual annotation of an object segmentation dataset especially challenging. In this paper, an automated annotation procedure for object segmentation datasets is presented. Our method uses an industrial robot arm and a camera mounted to the robot’s end effector to collect a set of images showing a scene from multiple viewpoints. Assuming that the end effector transformation and scene geometry are known with respect to the robot’s base frame, the object masks can be computed to each image using the projection model of the camera. Through a real-world implementation of the method, our study demonstrates the accuracy of our automated annotation including a genetic algorithm-based optimization of the camera intrinsic parameters and the transformation between the robot’s flange and the camera frame. Our results suggest, that the proposed automated dataset annotation can be a good alternative to manual labeling.

CPS are now autonomous and networked systems of systems with state-space exceeding the capabilities of conventional risk analysis methods. Model-based fault injection methods allow assessment of a system’s fault tolerance not only during its design phase but also in the course of operation. This allows the evaluation of updates and new modules before deploying such changes to a real system. Such operational model-based fault injection on a system’s digital twin can ensure continuous safety throughout all system life cycles.Modern risk analysis tools and Machine Learning-based safety methods require vast amounts of representative input and training data. Such methods not only will require mountains of erroneous time-series data from a myriad of operational cycles, but also corresponding fault parameter labels. As the state space of the system component explodes in complexity, it becomes problematic to cover all possible component fault combinations. As such, only those faults that could lead to potential failures or increased risk scenarios are of interest for automated safety assessment methodologies. It is clear that an intelligent and effective model-based fault injection method is required for the operational safety assessment of industrial CPS.Recently we introduced a new model-based fault injection method implemented as a highly customizable Simulink block called FIBlock. It supports the model-based injection of typical faults of CPS components such as sensors, software, computing, and network hardware. In this paper, we proposed a Deep Learning-based approach for model-based fault injection called FIDGET. It extends the FIBlock with Deep Reinforcement Learning capabilities. We employed a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to train the Reinforcement Learning agent to per-form the automated search of fault parameters that yield the biggest system response. It allows automatic generation of labeled training data for further use in risk analysis tools or to train fault classifiers. The generated training data consists of errors that lead to the biggest response (i.e., disturbance) of the system.","","978-1-6654-9996-5","10.1109/ETFA52439.2022.9921507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921507","cyber-physical system;error mitigation;fault injection;model-based method;deep learning;reinforcement learning;LSTM;exoskeleton system","Training;Software packages;Computational modeling;Software algorithms;Neural networks;Training data;Reinforcement learning","","1","","9","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To compute the situative risk, the proposed approach uses multi-agent adversarial reinforcement learning. Unlike the usual approach that uses the self-play mechanism to harden the agents against disturbances, the approach directly uses the self-play to determine the confidence that the system can handle the current situation. Based on the evaluation of the strength of the perceived perturbations, the robot’s digital twin calibrates the action space of the adversarial agents. In this way, the adversarial agents represent the disturbances that are likely to occur. From the simulation results of the competing agents, the digital twin infers the confidence with which the system can handle the situation. In the event that the system cannot handle the situation and crashes in the simulation, the digital twin calculates the probability that the simulated scenario will occur in reality. To calculate this probability, the authors propose the method of game-theoretic event trees. Combining the probability of an accident scenario with the damage caused by the simulated hazard, the results of situative risk are obtained. The approach is qualitatively evaluated using a case study. In this case study, a industrial mobile robot called Robotino is considered that connects workstations in a matrix production system. The case study shows that the approach is promising.","","978-1-6654-9996-5","10.1109/ETFA52439.2022.9921440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921440","situative risk;runtime risk assessment;safety;Industrial Mobile Robot;multi-agent adversarial reinforcement learning;risk estimation","Prototypes;Estimation;Reinforcement learning;Probability;Observers;Hazards;Digital twins","","1","","23","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed ML-based models are deployed on the field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for faster-than-real-time (FTRT) digital twin hardware emulation of the real power system. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) algorithm is adopted to train the SGM and DEM, where the training and testing datasets are obtained from the off-line simulation tool DSAToolsTM/TSAT®. A test system containing 15 ACTIVSg 500-bus systems interconnected by a 15-terminal DC grid is established for validating the accuracy of the proposed FTRT digital twin emulation platform. Due to the complexity of emulating large-scale AC-DC grid, multiple FPGA boards are applied, and a proper interface strategy is also proposed for data synchronization. As a result, the efficacy of the hardware emulation is demonstrated by two case studies, where an FTRT ratio of more than 684 is achieved by applying the GRU-SGM, while it reaches over 208 times for hybrid computational-ML based digital twin of AC-DC grid.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3217228","Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9930512","AC-DC grid;digital twin;dynamic equivalents;faster-than-real-time;field programmable gate arrays;gated recurrent unit;machine learning;parallel processing;power system stability;real-time systems;recurrent neural networks;synchronous generator","Mathematical models;Power system dynamics;Power system stability;Hardware;Computational modeling;Logic gates;Generators","","4","","27","CCBY","26 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This emerging technology has been considered a promising solution for various sectors to enhance the sustainability of business development. In general, DT relies on the living models for simulating system behaviors to monitor the systems or assets in production. Such models could be either mathematical/physics-based or data-driven, which are able to explain, predict, and describe system behaviors timely and accurately. Therefore, the machine learning-enabled modeling technology has become a powerful tool to develop such data-driven living models. However, data-driven models developed with supervised learning techniques carry a fatal deficiency: once the operational environments are changed, the model may hardly work well or even becomes useless due to the distribution shift between the training data and the new dataset. This paper attempts to address this issue by proposing to apply transfer learning techniques to develop lifetime robust living models for real-world DT systems. This paper presents a framework for developing lifetime data-driven living models.

Many modern airline accidents can be characterized as Interaction Accidents – no component failed, but the interaction of components resulted in a hazardous state.Due to the dependence of time, emergent behavior cannot be evaluated by analysis of the design. In theory it can be evaluated by Digital-Twin agent-based simulations. However, the running these simulations to uncover rare event emergent hazardous states is prohibitive due to: (1) the combinatorics of initial states of each of the components, and the (2) combinatorics of the time dimension (i.e. small variations in timing can result in very different outcomes). Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLNN) have shown promise to capture the underlying combinatoric behavior as well as compress the time dimension.This paper demonstrates the application of DLNN to identify emergent behavior from components with hybrid moded/continuous behavior that plays out over time. DLNNs were trained and tested for three systems with increasing behavioral complexity. The DLNNs accurately were able to represent the time dependent behavior for which they were trained/tested. The DLNNs were also able to learn and predict emergent behavior for behaviors that were not included in the training/testing data (up to 63% of the missing cases). The implications of these results are discussed.","2155-7209","978-1-6654-8607-1","10.1109/DASC55683.2022.9925815","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9925815","Deep Learning Neural Networks;Validation Testing;Emergent behavior;agent-based modeling.

However, their storage, runtime memory and computing requirements hinder their deployment on edge devices. This paper proposes a ViT pruning method with knowledge distillation, which can prune the ViT model and avoid the performance loss of the model after pruning. Based on the idea that knowledge distillation can make the student model improve the performance of the model by learning the unique knowledge of the teacher model, the convolution neural network (CNN) which has the unique ability of parameter sharing and local receptive field is used as a teacher model to guide the training of the ViT model and enable the ViT model to obtain the same ability.

Firstly, a four-degree-of-freedom dynamics simulation model was proposed for the rapid generation of bearing fault characteristics with a well-defined time-frequency domain. Subsequently, the commonalities and differences between the measured data distribution and the dynamics simulation signal were explored. Finally, a dynamic adversarial adaptive network that can extract invariant features in the hidden domain and automatically align the distribution of data in the source domain of the simulation and the data to be diagnosed in the target domain is developed. A rolling bearing fault diagnosis simulation experiment was designed, which used the dynamic model to generate the simulated signal with label information and the measured signal without label information to train the neural network. The classification and recognition of unlabeled samples are completed. The results show that the simulated signals contain information on the characteristics of bearing faults, which can characterise real bearing data. Moreover, the proposed dynamic adversarial adaptive network can achieve more accurate fault diagnosis of bearings.","","978-1-6654-9631-5","10.1109/PHM-Yantai55411.2022.9941841","National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9941841","component;bearing dynamics;domain adaptation;fault diagnosis;digital twin;transfer learning","Fault diagnosis;Vibrations;Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Rolling bearings;Vibration measurement;Feature extraction","","","","33","IEEE","14 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the increasing share of volatile, decentralised renewable energies and the promotion of electromobility, the grid operators of the transmission and distribution grids are facing new challenges among others in the operational management of the electrical grid. To be able to train future engineers and students for this challenging grid operation and to train employees of grid operators, practical, realistic experience is essential in addition to theoretical knowledge. Since incorrect switching operations on the real grid can have serious consequences, it is necessary to set up a simulation of a grid control station for this purpose. Current service providers train employees in special simulators. However, the use of these simulators is strictly limited to fixed dates. In addition, the participation of prospective engineers as students is often not accessible due to the high costs involved in theses training sessions. Therefore, this paper describes a grid control station in virtual reality. Real grids are represented as a digital twin and are integrated into the virtual reality control station. However, the coupling of these two components currently exists only as a concept but will be realised soon. The participants immerse into the virtual grid control station, perform switching actions in different scenarios, and experience the consequences of their actions to increase their practical knowledge in grid operations to face the future grid challenges. The VR grid control station is to be offered as an education opportunity in the field of power engineering at Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences.","","978-1-6654-5170-3","10.1109/GeCon55699.2022.9942753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9942753","Grid control station;virtual reality;grid security;digital twin;education opportunity","Training;Solid modeling;Renewable energy sources;Three-dimensional displays;Europe;Virtual reality;Switches","","1","","14","IEEE","14 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With applications like electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage, effective management of lithium-ion batteries is a vital enabler for a low-carbon future. Monitoring the battery’s condition of health and charge over the lifetime of an EV is, therefore, a highly pertinent issue. Battery Management Systems (BMS) are used during the operation of EVs to monitor, estimate and control battery states to ensure that batteries can function effectively and safely. Additionally, the materials composition, system design, and operating circumstances substantially impact a battery’s usable life, making it more challenging to govern and maintain battery systems. This work proposes the structure of a battery digital twin-based battery for the electronic vehicle, which has the potential to enhance BMS situational awareness greatly and enable the optimal functioning of battery storage units. Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence (AI) present an opportunity and offer. In this paper, a Digital Twin (DT) is proposed as a solution to the difficulty of onboard computation for the incremental State Of Health (SOH) and State Of Charge (SOC) by using Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) model and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to predict the state estimate for the EV battery. The battery’s condition has been determined by using the EKF, which can provide vital information for maintenance. First, the battery’s usable life can be extended with an accurate estimate of the SOC to continue; then a learning-based prediction approach to gauge the battery’s health state is suggested in order to increase battery life. A SOC model is frequently retrained to depict the effects of aging, and a SOH model is often performed to foretell the reduction in the highest battery capacity. According to a result, DT models are useful for managing batteries, and full life cycle statistics are important for planning the battery’s upgrade path.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3225093","Ministry of Small and Medium -Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and Startups (MSS), South Korea, under the Regional Specialized Industry Development Plus Program (Research and Development), supervised by the Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT)(grant numbers:S3246057); Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT) Grant through the Korea Government [Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy of Korea (MOTIE)], The Establishment Project of Industry-University Fusion District(grant numbers:P0016977); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9964197","Battery management system;digital twin;the battery state;electric vehicle;XGBoost","Battery management systems;Predictive models;Electric vehicles;Batteries;Digital twins;State of charge","","12","","53","CCBY","28 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we focus on intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) which is a life-threatening emergency that needs immediate diagnosis and treatment. ICH is caused by bleeding inside the skull or brain. Radiologists typically examine computed tomography (CT) scans of the patients to determine the ICH and its subtype. But the manual assessment of the CT scan is a complex and time-consuming task. The existing pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models are state-of-the-art for ICH classification. However, they employ poor feature extraction techniques which hinder overall model performance. Furthermore, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality and use redundant and noisy features. The problem of imbalanced data is also crucial for achieving model generalization. This paper proposes a hybrid attention-based ResNet architecture for ICH detection and classification. An attention mechanism allows the model to focus on a specific region and extract relevant features. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction and redundant feature removal whereas deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) is used for resolving the class imbalance problem. The proposed model is evaluated using the dataset assembled during the Radiologist Society of North America (RSNA) ICH detection challenge 2019. The results show that our proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and F1-score. ICH classification achieved accuracies of 99.2%, 97.1%, 96.7%, 96.7% and 96.1%, for detecting epidural hemorrhage (EH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), subdural hemorrhage (SH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) subtypes respectively. The F1-score of 96.1% for EH subtype is also best when compared with the benchmark models.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3225671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9966583","Computed tomography;data augmentation;deep convolutional generative adversarial network;deep learning;digital twin;health 4.0;intracranial hemorrhage;principal component analysis;ResNet-152V2","Computed tomography;Hemorrhaging;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Deep learning;Principal component analysis;Machine learning","","2","","48","CCBY","30 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ideally, a well trained deep reinforcement learning algorithm should be robust to unseen cases or unseen tasks with limited data. This paper proposes a new meta reinforcement learning algorithm with the Hebbian learning algorithm. According to the neuroscientific theory, Hebbian learning mimics the learning behaviours of the human brain. Neurons are activated repeatedly, and new neural networks are built with newly formed connections. Researchers have proved that compared with deep reinforcement learning, Hebbian learning can obtain the near-optimal solutions within short training iterations. In this paper, we use a teacher-student learning architecture. In the teacher model, the Hebbian learning model is trained with an evolutionary strategy while the student model is a deep reinforcement learning model trained with modified training procedures. Experiments prove that our proposed algorithm overwhelms the performances of the Hebbian learning algorithm and the original deep reinforcement learning vastly. Besides, with strong inductive biases introduced by learned knowledge from subtasks, the data efficiency of deep reinforcement learning is significantly boosted. Moreover, we set the target task and subtasks different primarily to prove the robustness of Hebbian learning as the teacher model. Experiments prove that this proposed meta reinforcement learning algorithm could boost data efficiency largely.","","978-1-6654-9299-7","10.1109/UEMCON54665.2022.9965711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9965711","Meta reinforcement learning;Hebbian learning;Transfer learning;Deep reinforcement learning","Deep learning;Training;Neurons;MIMICs;Reinforcement learning;Mobile communication;Data models","","4","","36","IEEE","1 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The team leader usually plays a key role in collaborative learning. However, the existing research ignores the key characteristics of learners and constraints relevant to e-learners when identifying appropriate team leaders and compatible members. A novel collaborative optimization approach to learning team formation is proposed based on a refined learner model and the environments—classes, agents, roles, groups, and objects (E-CARGO) model. With the proposed approach, a learner is modeled by combining 5-D characteristics (i.e., cognitive ability, leadership, sociability, learning style, and personality) and three types of constraints (e.g., conflicts, genders, and the number of members), and an assessment mechanism is designed to measure the comprehensive abilities of learners for identifying an ideal team leader and selecting the team members for a team. By innovatively introducing the role-based collaboration theory and E-CARGO model, the leader-centered learning team formation problem is formalized as a collaborative optimization problem. The mathematical model and the constraint relations are established for this problem, which is solved based on the IBM CPLEX package. Finally, a case study and experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is efficient and feasible, in favor of improving the satisfaction degree of learners.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2022.3224762","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62077014,71971221); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2021JJ30886); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9970248","Collaborative learning;environments–classes;agents;roles;groups;and objects (E-CARGO);learner model;learning team formation;team leader-centered","Federated learning;Optimization;Collaboration;Mathematical models;Leadership;Computational modeling;Genetic algorithms","","3","","","IEEE","5 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The UKF-based algorithm uses simulations of a digital twin directly to optimize the control policy and does not require gradients to be computed―making it suitable for differential-algebraic constraints, where gradients may be inaccessible. The proposed UKF-based algorithm does not require explicit knowledge of the internal model of the digital twin, nor the control map; that is, it is a purely simulation data-driven approach. The main advantage is that a high-precision simulation-oriented digital twin can approximate the physical dynamical system more accurately than an analytical control-oriented model and thus, can improve the performance of the controller. The digital twin-based optimal control approach is evaluated on two case studies. First, a pendulum on a cart is optimized to swing up and stabilize.

This paper proposes a machine learning-based digital twin model for pressure prediction in a fuel injection system, split into two steps. First, we extract statistical engine features based on a predefined time window to represent the engine behavior over time. Second, a digital twin implemented through a machine learning model is used to predict pressure levels in the fuel injection system.

The LSTM model is configured with Adam optimizer and the mean absolute error (MAE) loss function. The early stopping criterion is also employed as a regularization technique to overcome model overfitting. Secondly, we develop our proposed hybrid DT by integrating both the existing DT and the LSTM model. Thirdly, we formulate an empirical mathematical model, which allows us to better replicate behavior of battery degradation of any lithium-ion battery.

The usage of digital twins in manufacturing processes leads to an enhancement in process understanding due to the continuous processing and evaluation of production data. Hence, when properly implemented, it empowers the ability to increase the agility, traceability, and resilience of production systems. Despite these merits, the scalability and fidelity of digital twins at the manufacturing field level are limited by heterogeneous data sources as well as modeling uncertainties, e.g., due to coarse approximation and imprecise parameter identification. This study proposes a novel approach to overcome these deficiencies by exploiting machine learning on aggregated data throughout the product development process. A procedure is established to contextualize metadata sources from the construction, planning, manufacturing, and quality stages into a quality feature-based digital thread. On this basis, a hybrid approach for quantifying modeling uncertainties across the model chain is developed by incorporating the production domain knowledge into AI techniques. As a result, the digital twin takes into account disturbances from the physical manufacturing environment and estimates the reliability of the modeled outcomes. An exemplary implementation of this concept is demonstrated by using a cutting-edge digital process twin for machining quality monitoring.","","978-1-6654-6297-6","10.1109/DASC/PiCom/CBDCom/Cy55231.2022.9928016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9928016","Digital Twin;Cyber Manufacturing;Industry 4.0;Artificial Intelligence","Uncertainty;Systematics;Computational modeling;Soft sensors;Metadata;Digital twins;Reliability","","1","","20","IEEE","13 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Knowledge distilling techniques and keeping subset of data from the old classes have been proposed to revamp models to accommodate new classes. These techniques allow models to sustain their knowledge without forgetting everything they already know but somewhat alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem. In this study we propose class incremental learning using bi-distillation (CILBD) method that effectively learn not only the classes of the new data but also previously learned classes. The proposed architecture uses knowledge distillation in such a way that the student model directly learns knowledge from two teacher model and thus alleviate the forgetting of the old class.

To examine the model’s suitability for anomaly detection, we execute several simulations of fault conditions.

Such stressors can lead to a reduction in the remaining useful life of electrical cables, jeopardizing the safety of NPP systems. To evaluate the effect of stressors on the degradation of electrical cables, electrical reflectometry methods are commonly employed. Frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) is a non-destructive electrical reflectometry method that uses transmission line theory to detect degradation or impedance changes within electrical cables. However, in most cases FDR is only applied to de-energized cables, limiting the application in NPPs as the cable system must be taken offline. In this work, we explore the development of an FDR digital twin to predict the degradation of an electrical cable exposed to elevated temperature, which is expected to reduce the need for offline FDR. A 3-conductor low-voltage electrical cable was selected for evaluation of the digital twin. The fully three-dimensional digital twin was developed in COMSOL using the radio frequency module. A cable length of 30-m and frequency bandwidth of 400 MHz was selected to mimic real-world application of FDR. Over a 1-m region, the permittivity of the insulation was varied by up to 20% to model thermal degradation. The results demonstrate accurate detection of the insulation damage region, supporting further investigation of the FDR digital twin using real-world data and machine learning for predictive damage estimation or remaining lifetime.","2576-2397","978-1-6654-6795-7","10.1109/CEIDP55452.2022.9985387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9985387","Digital twin;electrical cable;insulation;FDR","Degradation;Three-dimensional displays;Power cables;Frequency-domain analysis;Power cable insulation;Machine learning;Reflectometry","","","","4","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the final performance of UDA method is still far behind that of supervised learning due to the lack of annotations. Researchers introduce the semi-supervised learning (SSL) and propose a more practical setting, semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA), that is, having labeled source domain data and a small number of labeled target domain data. To address the inter-domain gap, current researches focus on domain alignment by mixing annotated data from two domains, but we argue that adapting the target domain data distribution through model transfer is a better solution. In this paper, we propose a two-stage SSDA framework based on this assumption. Firstly, we adapt the model from the source domain to the labeled dataset in the target domain. To verify the assumption, we choose a basic transfer mode: finetuning. Then, to align the labeled subspace and the unlabeled subspace of the target domain, we choose teacher-student model with class-level data augmentation as the basis to realize online self-training. We also provide a deformation to solve overfitting on the target domain with a small number of annotated data. Extensive experiments on two synthetic-to-real benchmarks have demonstrated the correctness of our idea and the effectiveness of our method.

On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence is taking over some elements and tasks with automatic control (independent of human interaction). If the result is out of tolerance or if a random sample of the result is audited, the decision support system is validating the Artificial Intelligence result for execution (by human interaction). The hybrid production management system is to be used to control production processes and generates learning effects. The extension by methods of Artificial Intelligence opens possibilities to process and to master certain tasks independently of human interaction.

Moreover, at end-of-life electronic devices, the PCBs become Waste PCBs (WPCBs), the primary source of high-value materials in electronic waste. However, the recycling process is challenging because of the WPCB’s high composition diversity. EC detection in WPCBs can reduce the uncertainty about WPCBs composition and help select a better recycling process. Nevertheless, large fully-annotated datasets for the PCB domain are available at a high cost. For WPCBs, there is only one publicly available dataset, the PCB-DSLR, and it is partially labeled. As for PCBs, the FICS-PCB dataset is available. However, it contains images of modern and clean PCBs, all in good condition, while the first has broken and dirty parts. Thus, we propose a self-training strategy for object detection algorithms without needing a fully labeled dataset. In the strategy, the YOLOv5 model is used to detect the eight types of electronic components present in FICS-PCB in PCB-DSLR, which initially has labels only for integrated circuits. The process occurs through the interaction between a teacher model, trained with the FICSPCB data, and a student model, which is trained by joining the FICS-PCB data and the teacher-generated labels for PCB-DSLR. The results show that the student model performs better in the electronic components detection task, obtaining greater precision and sensitivity when compared to the teacher model. Since we are dealing with partially labeled data, we provide a low-dimensional representation of the detections of both models using t-SNE.","2377-5416","978-1-6654-5385-1","10.1109/SIBGRAPI55357.2022.9991743","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9991743","Self-training;Electronic components detector;Teacher-student models","Uncertainty;Sensitivity;Printed circuits;Electronic components;Detectors;Object detection;Data models","","1","","18","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In CTDE, centralized information is dedicated to learning the allocation of the team reward with a mixing network, while the learning of individual Q-values is usually based on local observations. The insufficient utility of global observation will degrade performance in challenging environments. To this end, this work proposes a novel Centralized Teacher with Decentralized Student (CTDS) framework, which consists of a teacher model and a student model. Specifically, the teacher model allocates the team reward by learning individual Q-values conditioned on global observation, while the student model utilizes the partial observations to approximate the Q-values estimated by the teacher model. In this way, CTDS balances the full utilization of global observation during training and the feasibility of decentralized execution for online inference. Our CTDS framework is generic, which is ready to be applied upon existing CTDE methods to boost their performance.

There are also attempts to bridge the gap between the two by incorporating learning-based AI algorithms into digital twins to mitigate mismatches between the digital twin model and the physical system. One of the most straightforward approaches to this is direct input adaptation. In this paper, we ask whether it is useful to employ a generic learning algorithm in such a setting, and our conclusion is “not very”. We denote an algorithm to be more useful than another algorithm based on three aspects: 1) it requires fewer data samples to reach a desired minimal performance, 2) it achieves better performance for a reasonable number of data samples, and 3) it accumulates less regret. In our evaluation, we randomly sample problems from an industrially relevant geometry assurance context and measure the aforementioned performance indicators of 16 different algorithms. Our conclusion is that blackbox optimization algorithms, designed to leverage specific properties of the problem, generally perform better than generic learning algorithms, once again finding that “there is no free lunch”. Note to Practitioners—Digital twins have the potential to improve productivity and quality in complex systems such as manufacturing systems. Their impact on system performance hinges on the accuracy of their digital models around the system’s operating points. Difficult to measure phenomena, such as wear and tear of equipment, however, may cause a mismatch between the digital twin model and the physical system. In this paper, we formalize this problem and compare 16 potential solution strategies under practical aspects. We argue that readily available off-the-shelf blackbox optimization algorithms may prove more useful for this problem, than more recent learning-based approaches. Specifically, gradient-based algorithms will perform best in systems with high-dimensional, continuous, and non-linear performance functions – even in the presence of white measurement noise.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3231386","Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research through the Smart Assembly 4(grant numbers:0000DONOTUSETHIS0000.0); Project within the Winquist Laboratory; Vinnova; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10003111","Smart manufacturing;cyber-physical systems;digital twins;learning (artificial intelligence);adaptive optimization;blackbox optimization","Digital twins;Optimization;Adaptation models;Closed box;Geometry;Artificial intelligence;Additives","","","","","IEEE","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, no digital twin has been developed in this field due to the complexity of greenhouse production. Therefore, this paper presents a case study of a DT development for a Danish greenhouse production flow using multi-method modeling and multi-agent simulation. The results show that the developed DT can accurately represent the greenhouse production process and estimate the plant growth state with an absolute error of 0.31 days compared to the observed production. Furthermore, the developed DT can accurately predict deviations to the plant growth state corresponding to previously observed behavior at the facility. To capture the greenhouse production process flow at the top-level greenhouse DT agent, the underlying physical agents developed included: compartments, growth climate, conveyors, staff, tables, plants, soil machine, table loading, and packing station as well as the packing station.

In this paper, we consider a scenario of utilizing computing resources at the edge servers to render the virtual representation of physical industrial scenes for workers. In order to provide an immersive experience, the rendered virtual representation in the form of high-quality video needs to be delivered with low latency. The quality of delivered contents is associated with rendering resources and content bitrate, and high-quality contents result in large rendering and transmission delay. The joint resource allocation problem has been formulated, allocating limited bandwidth and edge computing resources, and determining the bitrate of content to achieve low latency and high content quality, in which two objectives are conflicting. To solve this problem, we employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based multi-objective optimization approach which decomposes the original problem into a series of subproblems. Instead of training the DRL model for each subproblem with equal number of episodes, an adaptive subproblem model training scheme has been proposed which terminates the training of subproblem model early based on the model convergence to improve the overall training efficiency. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation strategy in terms of content quality and delay.","","978-1-6654-3540-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10001316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10001316","Digital twin;resource allocation;deep reinforcement learning;multi-objective optimization","Training;Adaptation models;Solid modeling;Bit rate;Rendering (computer graphics);Digital twins;Manufacturing","","","","15","IEEE","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to address the above issues, a digital twin-driven dynamic prediction method for the operational performance of RPL is proposed. Firstly, the manufacturing process description model and operational performance evaluation indicator are constructed based on multi-source manufacturing data from products, industrial robot equipment, and system operation dimensions. Exploring the time-varying mechanism of the manufacturing system, the digital twin model of RPL is constructed from multi-dimension. Then the correlation between manufacturing data and operational performance is explored using grey relational analysis (GRA).

In this paper, we explore self-supervised learning for the purpose of learning generalized features and propose a score fusion module to integrate outputs from multiple expert models to obtain a unified prediction. Specifically, we take inspiration from the observation that networks trained on a less unbalanced subset of the distribution tend to produce better performance than networks trained on the entire dataset. However, subsets from tail classes are not adequately represented due to the limitation of data size, which means that their performance is actually unsatisfactory. Therefore, we employ self-supervised learning (SSL) on the whole dataset to obtain a more generalized and transferable feature representation, resulting in a sufficient improvement in subset performance. Unlike previous work that used knowledge distillation models to distill the models trained on a subset to get a unified student model, we propose a score fusion module that directly exploits and integrates the predictions of the subset models.

Digital-twins are an established technology and will play a crucial role in optimizing manufacturing plants in the near future.

Scattered communities of users are assigned a limited number of channels, and the flying BS is autonomously and optimally placed according to predefined criteria. Q-learning, a common type of RL, is employed as a solution to optimization of BS placement. Two optimization objectives are considered to maximize the per-user data rate in the worst condition and minimize the total BS transmitted power, respectively. To overcome resource limitations of the aerial BS, the RL training with many iterations is done in the DT virtual space connected to the physical space via an aerial BS. In particular, a practically sound max-min technique is proposed to handle the measurement and prediction uncertainties. It is shown that, even if the models used in DT are imperfect and measurements are inaccurate, nearly-optimal results can be obtained in DT. Compared to RL training 100% in the physical space, a huge number of BS moves can be avoided and a significant amount of time and energy can be saved. The assessment results suggest that model and measurement errors, especially when applying DT, should be seriously considered, and the robust optimization technique has potential to handle the uncertainties.","2577-2465","978-1-6654-5468-1","10.1109/VTC2022-Fall57202.2022.10012827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10012827","6G;aerial base station (BS);beyond 5G (B5G);digital twin (DT);reinforcement learning (RL);robust Q-learning","Training;Measurement errors;Base stations;Q-learning;Uncertainty;Atmospheric measurements;Measurement uncertainty","","","","17","IEEE","18 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DLSC significantly boost communication efficiency by only transmitting the meaning of data, showing great potentials for applications like automatic driving, digital twin and smart health. However, DLSC are fragile to black-box adversarial attacks due to the openness of wireless channel and sensitivities of neural models. To this end, this paper proposes SemBAT, a novel approach for crafting physical layer black-box adversarial attacks for semantic communication systems. The key ingredients of our method include the training of surrogate encoder and generation of adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we train our surrogate encoder by directly estimating the gradients based on Jacobian-matrixs, and then generate the adversarial perturbations by the particle swarm optimizations. Extensive experiments on a public benchmark show the effectiveness of our proposed SemBAT. We observe that our SemBAT with black-box adversaries can sharply decrease the classification accuracy of the semantic communication system from 78.4% to 11.6%.

During crane operations, kinematic data were collected, which were classified by machine learning algorithms for activity recognition and duration extraction. Based on the identified durations, Goodness-of-Fit techniques determined suitable probability density functions. The resulting probability density functions were used as input parameters in stochastic discrete event simulations. It was shown that with enriched data collection, probability density functions have to be updated.

The greatly reduced and deterministic computational costs enable new use cases such as digital twin control systems and global optimization. The challenge of building these proxy models is generating the training data. A naive uniform sampling of the input space can result in a non-uniform sampling of the output space of a model. This can cause gaps in the training data coverage that can miss finer scale details resulting in poor accuracy. While larger and larger data sets could eventually fill in these gaps, the computational burden of full-scale simulation codes can make this prohibitive. In this paper, we present an adaptive data generation method that utilizes uncertainty estimation to identify regions where training data should be augmented. By targeting data generation to areas of need, representative data sets can be generated efficiently. The effectiveness of this method will be demonstrated on a simple one-dimensional function and a complex multidimensional physics model.","","978-1-6654-8045-1","10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020884","UT-Battelle; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10020884","component;formatting;style;styling;insert","Adaptation models;Uncertainty;Computational modeling;Training data;Machine learning;Big Data;Aerospace electronics","","","","30","IEEE","26 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in open-world scenarios, streaming big data can be Out-Of-Distribution (OOD), rendering these algorithms ineffective. Prior solutions to the OOD challenge seek to identify invariant features across different training domains. The underlying assumption is that these invariant features should also work reasonably well in the unlabeled target domain. By contrast, this work is interested in the domain-specific features that include both invariant features and features unique to the target domain. We propose a simple yet effective approach that relies on correlations in general regardless of whether the features are invariant or not. Our approach uses the most confidently predicted samples identified by an OOD base model (teacher model) to train a new model (student model) that effectively adapts to the target domain.

Therefore, we proposed the concept of topological twin. The aim of topological twin is to (1) extract topological structures hidden implicitly in the real world, (2) reproduce them explicitly in the cyber world, and (3) simulate and analyze the real world in the cyber world. The topological twin plays the important role in extracting and connecting structures hidden in real world from the mutliscopic point of view. In this talk, we discuss the concept of topological twin for sophisticated service to people in order to bridge the cyber-physical gap from the multiscopic point of view.

We can bring the trailer living laboratory to elderly houses, hospitals, and public spaces, and discuss the co-creation towards open innovation using daily life settings with multi-stakeholder approach.

Deep learning methods have been utilized in and have achieved a lot of successes in various applications involving wearables fields. However, wearable sensor data has unique issues related to sensitivity and variability between subjects, and dependency on sampling-rate for analysis. To mitigate these issues, a different type of analysis using topological data analysis has shown promise as well. Topological data analysis (TDA) captures robust features, such as persistence images (PI), in complex data through the persistent homology algorithm, which holds the promise of boosting machine learning performance. However, because of the computational load required by TDA methods for large-scale data, integration and implementation has lagged behind. Further, many applications involving wearables require models to be compact enough to allow deployment on edge-devices. In this context, knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely applied to generate a small model (student model), using a pre-trained high-capacity network (teacher model). In this paper, we propose a new KD strategy using two teacher models - one that uses the raw time-series and another that uses persistence images from the time-series. These two teachers then train a student using KD. In essence, the student learns from heterogeneous teachers providing different knowledge. To consider different properties in features from teachers, we apply an annealing strategy and adaptive temperature in KD. Finally, a robust student model is distilled, which utilizes the time series data only. We find that incorporation of persistence features via second teacher leads to significantly improved performance. This approach provides a unique way of fusing deep-learning with topological features to develop effective models.","2576-2303","978-1-6654-5906-8","10.1109/IEEECONF56349.2022.10052019","NIH(grant numbers:R01GM135927); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10052019","knowledge distillation;topological data analysis;time series data analysis;wearable sensor data","Temperature distribution;Data analysis;Annealing;Computational modeling;Wearable computers;Image edge detection;Time series analysis","","1","","30","IEEE","7 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, the huge storage and computational costs of high-performance models severely limit their deployment on resource-limited embedded devices. Knowledge distillation (KD) is the mainstream approach for models compression, but the existing KD framework has some limitations. First, the student model underperforms when there is a considerable capacity gap between the student and teacher models, which reduces the model compression rate in knowledge distillation. Second, compared with training from scratch, the billions of additional forward propagation of the complex teacher model is time-consuming, resulting longer train time in the distillation process. This paper proposes AKD, an efficient difference-adaptive knowledge distillation framework. AKD consists of two modules. The distillation module uses a modified auxiliary teaching architecture as the backbone, and the adaptive module introduces a difference-adaptive method, which can adjust the teacher model adaptively according to the continuously improving representation ability of the student model. Experimental results on different kinds of datasets and models indicate that AKD not only improves the efficiency of distillation, but also enhances the performance of the compact student model and raise the compression rate.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074781","model compression;embedded devices;knowledge distillation","Training;Performance evaluation;Deep learning;Adaptation models;Smart cities;Computational modeling;Neural networks","","","","32","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The construction of a new-type power system at the industrial park level is the first demonstration of the coordinated optimization and intelligent control of power sources, grid, load, and energy storage to make overall planning to achieve diversified development. To sustain the ‘balance, security, diversity, and low cost’ construction goals of the new-type power system at the park level, the power grid dispatching and control system is transformed to the direction of intelligence and automation, which is reflected in the rapid emergence and construction of complex systems such as digital twin, simulation, reinforcement learning, model training and prediction, and intelligent decision-making of the EMS (Energy Manage System). This brings more complex data sharing, interaction, construction, and other technical requirements than ever before. At the same time, along with the simultaneous construction of new power systems such as micro-grids, virtual power plants, and distributed photovoltaic systems, it has exacerbated the problems of data divergence from business, low data utilization, and centralized architecture brought by the data lakes and data warehouses under the previous monolithic architecture, leading to the data model hard to deploy to meet the demand for efficient collection, interaction, and sharing of scattered and heterogeneous data under the new generation energy structure and greatly increases the work pressure of the data team, making the data team a bottleneck for business applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel design scheme of data processing framework with the data mesh concept, supports the federal computing and analysis engine by building a distributed metadata center, changes the previous centralized data modeling method through data service and productization, realizes data sharing and interaction between complex multi-systems by defining service invocation and encapsulation technology means, improves data utilization, and better supports the automation, rationalization, and balanced construction of the intelligent dispatch system to meet the challenges and requirements brought by the new-type park-level power system.","","978-1-6654-9327-7","10.1109/ICEI57064.2022.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10097342","data mesh;dispatching system;interaction;metadata","Automation;Buildings;Distributed databases;Computer architecture;Predictive models;Metadata;Data processing","","1","","23","IEEE","12 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When few human annotations are available, active self-training is one of the efficient approaches for reducing human annotation costs which integrates pseudo labels of self-training into the procedure of active learning. The traditional active self-training approaches mix manual labels and pseudo labels indistinguishably without considering the impact of active learning and self-training on each other. There are two problems for active self-training in few-shot text classification: (1) The noise in a large number of pseudo-labels may mislead the model training. (2) The confusing samples in overlap boundaries between classes are especially difficult to identify correctly with a few labels. To solve these problems, we propose UCL-AST, an active self-training framework that boosts the performance of the active teacher model to provide superior pseudo labels for the self-training student model and facilitates the active teacher model to learn more clear class boundaries with uncertainty-aware clouded logits in few-shot.

Traditionally, WT manufacturers carry out grid compliance tests at full-scale prototype turbines whereas WPP developers and Transmission System Operators (TSOs) mainly perform studies for new WPPs based on offline RMS and EMT simulations. Until now, these strategies have been sufficient for ensuring grid compliance of WTs and WPPs, however moving forward the wind sector needs new testing methods to meet the increasing WT capacity, WPP complexity, and deployment pace to achieve society's desired sustainability targets. In this paper, the emerging strategies that target these challenges are presented as: a) subsystems and component testing of WTs specified in IEC 61400- 21-4; b) - hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) real time simulation for WT/WPP control and protection appraisals (future 61400-21-5). Finally, a future outlook is given on the importance of addressing model validation and how these strategies can be complemented with other modern analytical tools such as artificial intelligence/machine learning, data-driven dynamic modelling, digital twin technology, and software-in-the-loop (SiL) real time simulation.","","978-1-83953-833-9","10.1049/icp.2022.2745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10117508","","","","","","","","5 May 2023","","","IET","IET Conferences"

They serve as pressure, temperature, and flow rate regulators. Hence detailed information about these parameters within the complex valve shape is particularly useful for design, optimisation, and efficient operation of control valves. For better reliability and operation under safety-critical installations, extensive research is being carried out to develop multi-layer and knowledge-intensive digital twins for such valves. This paper reports a computational investigation to determine the local valve flow coefficient (Cv) at various valve opening positions (VOP)/flow rate conditions and develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the local Cv distribution within the valve-pipe system. This is expected to provide sufficient information to embed extensive knowledge base in the valve’s digital twin. Ten internal locations (at L/D=1 to 10) were chosen for data extraction to give a detailed Cv profile from the pipe inlet through the valve to the pipe outlet. Three VOPs (20, 60, and 100%) were considered and for each, three inlet velocities of 1, 2 and 3 m/s were simulated. This combination resulted in a database of 90 data-points which were used to train the ANN using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. MATLAB’s Neural Network Toolbox was used with 70%, 15%, and 15% of the data used for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Model performance was measured using the mean-square-error and square-of-residuals (R2) metrics. Sensitivity analysis of hidden layer neuron number was conducted, and the results show that 10 neurons produced a robust prediction of the CV profile. An overall average R2 of 0.92 was obtained. Hence, it may be efficiently used for the valve’s internal (rather than global) CV prediction for design and other purposes – including implementation within digital twin architectures for remote/condition monitoring in difficult to reach areas such as offshore and within complex industrial sites.","","978-1-6654-6179-5","10.1109/ICMIAM56779.2022.10146806","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10146806","Artificial neural network;Control valve;Digital Twin;Single-phase flow;Pressure drop","Training;Oils;Neurons;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Valves;Mathematical models","","","","14","IEEE","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Metaverse relies on a core approach, digital twinning, which is a means to replicate physical world objects, people, actions and scenes onto the virtual world. Being able to access scenes and information associated with the physical world, in the Metaverse in real-time and under mobility, is essential in developing a highly accessible, interactive and interconnective experience for all users. This development allows users from other locations to access high-quality real-world and up-to-date information about events happening in another location, and socialize with others hyper-interactively. Nevertheless, receiving continual, smooth updates generated by others from the Metaverse is a challenging task due to the large data size of the virtual world graphics and the need for low latency transmission. With the development of Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR), users can interact via the Metaverse in a highly interactive manner, even under mobility. Hence in our work, we considered an environment with users in moving Internet of Vehicles (IoV), downloading real-time virtual world updates from Metaverse Service Provider Cell Stations (MSPCSs) via wireless communications. We design an environment with multiple cell stations, where there will be a handover of users' virtual world graphic download tasks between cell stations. As transmission latency is the primary concern in receiving virtual world updates under mobility, our work aims to allocate system resources to minimize the total time taken for users in vehicles to download their virtual world scenes from the cell stations. We utilize a deep reinforcement learning approach and evaluate the performance of the algorithms under different environmental configurations.

We use a new training scheme for marine microalgae detection that consists of two phases: a teacher benchmark model phase and a student model learning phase. Using teacher model supervision to get better student model training results. Through a simple and fast image fusion method, we can obtain more realistic algae-generated images to extend the training set and eventually improve the convergence speed and performance of the model. Based on the algorithms of YOLOv5 and YOLOv6, we use the DHLC backbone network fusion method to fuse features from different levels of C3 modules and BepC3 modules together as the input of the PANet middle layer. We also use the module in BoTNet network to obtain stronger feature extraction capability by introducing self-attention mechanism in the yolo model. Since there are many small targets in marine microalgae images, we also extend the YOLOv6l model to the more powerful YOLOv6l-P6 model, which can get better detection results in the input image size of 1280. In addition, we also use time-test augmentation (TTA), weighted boxes fusion (WBF) and Single-class wighted boxes fusion (SinWBF) techniques to optimize the performance of each class. These strategies greatly improve the model detection performance and robustness under the conditions of small amount of marine microalgae microscopic image data.

This paper studies the adaptive scheduling of flexible workshops and combines the digital twin technology to establish a digitaltwin-based prototype system of self-adaptive scheduling of flexible workshop. Targeting the real-time and adaptability requirements of workshop scheduling in dynamic production environments, and based on the digital twin environment of workshops, this paper selects the average delivery time of workpieces as the optimization target, and proposes a Deep Q-network (DQN) method driven by the perception-cognitive dual system. The perception system generates workshop states using digital twins and knowledge graphs; the cognitive system abstracts the scheduling process into a process sequencing agent to optimize the completion time, and uses a workshop state matrix to describe the constraints of the problem, introducing order selection and workpiece selection actions step by step into the scheduling decision-making process; then a reward function is designed to evaluate the decision. The superiority of the proposed method is verified by the example verification and algorithm comparison analysis in the sewing workshop of a garment factory.","","979-8-3503-4655-8","10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-ScalCom-DigitalTwin-PriComp-Metaverse56740.2022.00359","Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10189650","Smart factory;flexible workshop;deep reinforcement learning;digital twin;DQN network","Job shop scheduling;Conferences;Decision making;Production equipment;Production;Optimal scheduling;Search problems","","","","14","IEEE","27 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computation offloading is a mechanism to utilize resources well by moving resource-intensive applications from terminal devices to network edge or cloud servers. However, there are still some challenges in applying computation offloading to the Industrial Internet environment due to the complexity and uncertainty of the actual industrial environment. Emerging Digital Twin (DT) is capable of predicting, estimating, and analyzing the real-time state of physical entities and monitoring system environments by creating virtual models of physical entities. Therefore, in this paper, we design a Digital Twin-assisted End-Edge-Cloud collaboration architecture for Industrial Internet (DT-EEC) and propose a computation offloading method based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to minimize the average delay and energy consumption of task processing under this architecture. In addition, we find the extra delay and energy consumption caused by the unreliability of computing nodes are often ignored in previous studies, so the reliability of IoT terminal devices and edge servers are also considered in our computation offloading.

An adaptive e-learning system needs to deduce the learner model for adding personalization to instructional websites. The learner model is the perception repository about the e-content user, which can be inferred implicitly by employing meaningful semantic analysis of the text. In this research, a novel methodology is proposed to conceptually deduce the semantic learner model for personalized e-learning recommendations. Firstly, Conceptual Learner Model (CLM) is developed based on the learner's behavior and context-based text semantic representation by exploiting concepts from the ConceptNet knowledge base, with a significant association of patterns and rules. Then, Expanded Contextual Learner Model (ECLM) is developed by exploring the latent semantics in graphs to add concepts with the common-sense meanings that exceeded the named entities. The learner's knowledge graph is defined based on contextually associated concepts. Semantic relations in ConceptNet are exploited to extend learner models. The Normalized Particle Swarm Optimization (NPSO) algorithm is used to learn the importance of the relation types between the concepts. Thus, CLM and ECLM each are represented as a vector of weighted concepts in which updating is obtained automatically. The proposed recommendation system incorporates dynamic learner models to predict an appropriate e-content with the highest ranking, matching the true needs of a particular learner. Our simulation results show that the performance of ECLM is better Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) value 0.780 than other existing methods.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10246921","Personalized E-learning recommendation;contextual learner model;semantic analysis;knowledge graph;normalized PSO;prefix tree","Analytical models;Adaptation models;Social computing;Electronic learning;Computational modeling;Simulation;Semantics","","","","32","","22 Sep 2023","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

Sentiment Analysis gives us perception on how a specific scientific material is suitable to be recommended to the learner. It depends on the feedback of a similar learner taking many factors under consideration such as preference, knowledge level, and learning pattern. In this work, a hybrid e-learning recommendation system is proposed based on individualization and Sentiment Analysis. A new approach is provided for modelling the semantic user model based on the generated semantic matrix to capture the learner's preferences based on their selections of interest. The extracted semantic matrix is used for text representation by utilizing ConceptNet knowledge base which relies on contextual graph and expanded terms to represent the correlation among terms and materials. On the extracted terms from semantic user model, Word Embeddings-Based-Sentiment Analysis (WEBSA) must recommend the learning materials with highest rating to the learners properly. Variant models of (WEBSA) are proposed relying on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate effective vocabulary representations along with the use of qualitative customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for sentiment multi-classification tasks. To validate the language model, two datasets are used, a tailored dataset that has been created by scraping reviews of different e-learning resources, and a public dataset.

In this work, we propose FedAUX, an extension to FD, which, under the same set of assumptions, drastically improves the performance by deriving maximum utility from the unlabeled auxiliary data. FedAUX modifies the FD training procedure in two ways: First, unsupervised pre-training on the auxiliary data is performed to find a suitable model initialization for the distributed training. Second,  $(\varepsilon, \delta)$ -differentially private certainty scoring is used to weight the ensemble predictions on the auxiliary data according to the certainty of each client model. Experiments on large-scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer models demonstrate that our proposed method achieves remarkable performance improvements over state-of-the-art FL methods, without adding appreciable computation, communication, or privacy cost.

In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised nuclei segmentation framework which exploits only sparsely annotated bounding boxes, without any segmentation labels. The key is to integrate the traditional image segmentation and self-training into fully supervised instance segmentation. We first leverage the traditional segmentation to generate coarse masks for each box-annotated nucleus to supervise the training of a teacher model, which is then responsible for both the refinement of these coarse masks and pseudo labels generation of unlabeled nuclei. These pseudo labels and refined masks along with the original manually annotated bounding boxes jointly supervise the training of student model. Both teacher and student share the same architecture and especially the student is initialized by the teacher. We have extensively evaluated our method with both our DNA-ICM dataset and public cytopathological dataset.

In this article, we take a first step towards mitigating one of the most advanced misclassification attacks in transfer learning. We design a distilled differentiator via activation-based network pruning to enervate the attack transferability while retaining accuracy. We adopt an ensemble structure from variant differentiators to improve the defence robustness. To avoid the bloated ensemble size during inference, we propose a two-phase defence, in which inference from the Student model is first performed to narrow down the candidate differentiators to be assembled, and later only a small, fixed number of them can be chosen to validate clean or reject adversarial inputs effectively. Our comprehensive evaluations on both large and small image recognition tasks confirm that the Student models with our defence of only 5 differentiators are immune to over 90% of the adversarial inputs with an accuracy loss of less than 10%.

In this article, we propose a novel method for online knowledge distillation, termed feature fusion and self-distillation (FFSD), which comprises two key components: FFSD, toward solving the above problems in a unified framework. Different from previous works, where all students are treated equally, the proposed FFSD splits them into a leader student set and a common student set. Then, the feature fusion module converts the concatenation of feature maps from all common students into a fused feature map. The fused representation is used to assist the learning of the leader student. To enable the leader student to absorb more diverse information, we design an enhancement strategy to increase the diversity among students. Besides, a self-distillation module is adopted to convert the feature map of deeper layers into a shallower one. Then, the shallower layers are encouraged to mimic the transformed feature maps of the deeper layers, which helps the students to generalize better. After training, we simply adopt the leader student, which achieves superior performance, over the common students, without increasing the storage or inference cost.

Intelligent Digital Twin-based Software-Defined Vehicular Networks (IDT-SDVN) can overcome these weaknesses and maximize the advantages of the conventional SDVN architecture by enabling the controller to construct virtual network spaces and provide virtual instances of corresponding physical objects within the Digital Twin (DT). In this paper, we propose a junction-based hierarchical routing scheme in IDT-SDVN, namely, intelligent digital twin hierarchical (ELITE) routing. The proposed scheme is conducted in four phases: policy training and generation in the virtual network, and deployment and relay selection in physical networks. First, the policy learning phase employs several parallel agents in DT networks and derives multiple single-target policies. Second, the generation phase combines the learned policies and generates new policies based on complex communication requirements. Third, the deployment phase selects the most suitable generated policy according to the real-time network status and message types. A road path is calculated by the controller based on the selected policy and then sent to the requester vehicle. Finally, the relay selection phase is utilized to determine relay vehicles in a hop-by-hop process along the selected path. Simulation results demonstrate that ELITE achieves substantial improvements in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and communication overhead compared with its counterparts.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2022.3179254","Department of Science and Technology of Liaoning Province; Science Foundation of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:2020-MS-237); Liaoning Provincial Department of Education Science Foundation(grant numbers:JYT19052); Fujian Normal University(grant numbers:202001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872086); Science Foundation of Liaoning Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785887","Fuzzy logic;hierarchical routing;intelligent digital twin networks;reinforcement learning;software-defined vehicular networks","Routing;Relays;Roads;Measurement;Fuzzy logic;Vehicle dynamics;Training","","49","","41","IEEE","31 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this regard, federated learning (FL), a distributive AI paradigm, has opened up new opportunities for privacy preservation in IoMT without accessing the confidential data of the participants. Further, FL provides privacy to end-users as only gradients are shared during training. For these specific properties of FL, in this paper, we present privacy-related issues in IoMT.

As people become gradually inalienable to smart home infrastructures, their security conditions are getting more and more closely tied to everyone's privacy and safety. In this paper, we consider smart apps, either malicious ones with evil intentions or benign ones with logic errors, that can cause property loss or even physical sufferings to the user when being executed in a smart home environment and interacting with human activities and environmental changes. Unfortunately, current preventive measures rely on permission-based access control, failing to provide ideal protections against such threats due to the nature of their rigid designs. In this paper, we propose CommandFence, a novel digital-twin-based security framework that adopts a fundamentally new concept of protecting the smart home system by letting any sequence of app commands to be executed in a virtual smart home system, in which a deep-q network (DQN) is used to predict if the sequence could lead to a risky consequence. CommandFence is composed of an Interposition Layer to interpose app commands and an Emulation Layer to figure out whether they can cause any risky smart home state if correlating with possible human activities and environmental changes. We fully implemented our CommandFence implementation and tested against 553 official SmartApps on the Samsung SmartThings platform and successfully identified 34 potentially dangerous ones, with 31 of them reported to be problematic Author: Please provide index terms/keywords for your article.

However, the design of current traffic control systems fail to account for the vehicular traffic heterogeneity. In addition, the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) based traffic control strategies require large quantities of computation resources and generate high delay, which cannot meet the fault-intolerance requirement of the traffic control system. Therefore, there is an urgent need for constructing a new traffic control framework to jointly satisfy the fault-intolerance requirement and realize ubiquitous control over the heterogeneous vehicles. Inspired by this, a digital twin (DT) empowered edge AI framework is proposed in this article. The DT's virtualization capability is utilized to enable virtual risk assessment and performance analysis under the fault-intolerant traffic control system. In addition, the DT's offline learning capability helps the edge AI understand the road traffic data more intelligently to perform enforced optimizations and decisions. Then, a three-layer vehicle control paradigm is discussed under the proposed framework. In the first layer, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is utilized to intelligently control the CAV acceleration and lane-changing. In the second layer, indirect CV/HV control can be performed by adjusting the target speed and penetration rate of the DRL-controlled CAVs which are mixed in the traffic flow. In the third layer, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications and variable message signs are utilized to realize the direct control of CVs and HVs.

For example, unbalanced labels and sub-task learning difficulties may result in the biases that some labels and sub-tasks are overfitting, while the others are underfitting. To address these issues, inspired by neuro-symbolic learning systems, we propose a meta-based self-training method with a meta-weighter (MSM). We believe that a generalizable model can be achieved by appropriate symbolic representation selection (in-domain knowledge) and effective learning control (regulation) in a neural system. Thus, MSM trains a teacher model to generate in-domain knowledge (e.g., unlabeled data selection and pseudo-label generation), where the generated pseudo-labels are used by a student model for supervised learning. Then, the meta-weighter of MSM is jointly trained with the student model to provide each instance with sub-task-specific weights to coordinate their convergence rates, balancing class labels, and alleviating noise impacts introduced from self-training. The following experiments indicate that MSM can utilize 50% labeled data to achieve comparable results to state-of-arts models in ABSA and outperform them with all labeled data.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2022.3202831","Key Research and Development Program of Ningxia Hui Nationality Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2022BEG02025); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2021GXLH-Z-095); Industry Alignment Fund â Industry Collaboration Projects(grant numbers:RIE2020); Innovative Research Group of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61721002); Innovation Research Team of the Ministry of Education; Project of China Knowledge Centre for Engineering Science and Technology(grant numbers:IRT_17R86); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9870538","Aspect-based sentiment analysis;meta learning;self-training","Task analysis;Data models;Computational modeling;Training;Sentiment analysis;Portable computers;Gold","","27","","58","IEEE","30 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, in this article, we integrate the digital twin (DT) and the mobile edge computing (MEC) technologies into a hierarchical FL framework in the heterogeneous cellular network scenario. When the UDs are not in the service range of the small base stations (SBSs), the framework allows macro base stations to assist UDs' local computation, thus reducing the transmission delay.

To reduce the energy consumption of BSs, inactive components of BSs, with a certain activation/deactivation time, can sleep. In this study, we model the problem of BS energy saving utilizing multiple sleep modes as a sequential MDP and propose an online traffic-aware deep Q-learning approach to maximize the long-term energy saving. However, there is a risk that BS is not sleeping at the right time and incurs delays to the users. To tackle this issue, we propose to use a digital twin model to encapsulate the dynamics underlying the investigated system and estimate the risk of decision-making (RDM) in advance. We define a novel metric to quantify RDM and predict the performance degradation. Mobile operators can compare the RDM with a tolerable threshold to decide on deactivating SMs, re-training, or activating SMs. We trained an agent using real traffic, obtained from an operator's BS in Stockholm. The data-set contains data rate information with very coarse-grained time granularity. Thus, we propose a scheme to generate a new data-set using the real network data-set which 1) has finer-grained time granularity and 2) considers the bursty behavior of traffic data. Simulation results show that using proposed methods, considerable energy saving is obtained at cost of negligible number of delayed users. Moreover, the proposed digital twin model can predict the performance of the DQN proactively in terms of RDM hence preventing the performance degradation in the network in anomalous situations.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3206498","Vinnova, Swedish Innovation Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9891780","5G;base station;deep learning;digital twin;energy saving;sleep modes","Delays;Prediction algorithms;5G mobile communication;Energy consumption;Behavioral sciences;Heuristic algorithms;Digital twins","","","","37","IEEE","14 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing semi-supervised solutions show great potential for solving this problem. Their key idea is constructing consistency regularization with unsupervised data augmentation from unlabeled data for model training. The perturbations for unlabeled data enable the consistency training loss, which benefits semi-supervised semantic segmentation. However, these perturbations destroy image context and introduce unnatural boundaries, which is harmful for semantic segmentation. Besides, the widely adopted semi-supervised learning framework, i.e. mean-teacher, suffers performance limitation since the student model finally converges to the teacher model. In this paper, first of all, we propose a context friendly differentiable geometric warping to conduct unsupervised data augmentation; secondly, a novel adversarial dual-student framework is proposed to improve the Mean-Teacher from the following two aspects: (1) dual student models are learned independently except for a stabilization constraint to encourage exploiting model diversities; (2) adversarial training scheme is applied to both students and the discriminators are resorted to distinguish reliable pseudo-label of unlabeled data for self-training. Effectiveness is validated via extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2012 and Cityscapes. Our solution significantly improves the performance and state-of-the-art results are achieved on both datasets.

However, the dual challenges of limited energy capacity and insufficient computing power of unmanned aerial vehicles make it difficult to establish digital twin on aerial networks. In light of this, in this paper, we propose a lightweight DT empowered air-ground network architecture, where the DT modelling task is distributed to diverse ground devices based on federated learning. To improve the efficiency of DT modelling, we design a distributed incentive mechanism that incentivizes high-performance ground devices to take part in federated learning. Considering the computing burden and possible private disclosure caused by the incentive, we further solve the incentive scheme with a new distributed algorithm.

These simulation models often require calibration, or the estimation of an optimal set of parameters in some goodness-of-fit sense, to reflect a system’s observed behavior. While searching over the parameter space is an inevitable part of the calibration process, simulation models are rarely designed to be valid for arbitrarily large parameter spaces. The application of existing calibration methods, therefore, often results in repeated model evaluations using parameters that can cause the simulations to be impractically slow or even result in catastrophic failure. In general, the shape of subregions in the parameter space that could result in simulation failure is unknown. In this article, we propose a novel failure-robust Bayesian optimization (FR-BO) algorithm that learns these failure regions (FRs) from online simulations and informs a Bayesian optimization algorithm to avoid FRs while optimizing model parameters. This results in acceleration of the optimizer’s convergence and prevents wastage of time trying to simulate parameters with high failure probabilities. The effectiveness of the proposed FR-BO algorithm is demonstrated via a well-known benchmark example where we compare against state-of-the-art gradient matching techniques, and a practical example related to parameter estimation for digital twins of buildings.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2022.3216790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9936652","Bayesian optimization (BO);digital twin;dynamical systems;Gaussian processes;machine learning;numerical methods;simulation;system identification","Computational modeling;Data models;Calibration;Biological system modeling;Numerical models;Dynamical systems;Bayes methods","","1","","40","IEEE","3 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most previous studies concentrated on guiding the student network to learn the same representations on the normality, neglecting the different behaviors of the abnormality. This leads to a high probability of false detection of subtle defects. To address such an issue, we propose to push representations on abnormal areas of the teacher and student network as far as possible while pulling representations on normal areas as close as possible. Based on this idea, we design an efficient teacher-student model for anomaly detection and localization, which maximizes pixel-wise discrepancies for anomalous regions approximated by data augmentation and simultaneously minimizes discrepancies for pixel-wise normal regions between these two networks. The explicit differential knowledge distillation enlarges the margin between normal representations and abnormal ones in favour of discriminating them. Then, the appropriate small student network is not only efficient, but more importantly, helps inhibit the generalization ability of anomalous patterns when learning normal patterns, facilitating the precise decision boundary. The experimental results on the MVTec AD, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better performance than current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Especially, For the MVTec AD dataset with high resolution images, we achieve 98.1 AUROC% and 93.6 AUPRO% in anomaly localization, outperforming knowledge distillation based SOTA methods by 1.1 AUROC% and 1.5 AUPRO% with a lightweight model.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3218587","National Natural Science Foundation Program of China(grant numbers:U1909207,U21B2029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9940966","Unsupervised learning;knowledge distillation;anomaly detection;anomaly segmentation","Anomaly detection;Feature extraction;Training;Image reconstruction;Artificial neural networks;Task analysis;Location awareness","","2","","66","IEEE","7 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we propose a discriminative-generative distillation approach to learn privacy-preserving deep models. Our key idea is taking models as bridge to distill knowledge from private data and then transfer it to learn a student network via two streams. First, discriminative stream trains a baseline classifier on private data and an ensemble of teachers on multiple disjoint private subsets, respectively. Then, generative stream takes the classifier as a fixed discriminator and trains a generator in a data-free manner. After that, the generator is used to generate massive synthetic data which are further applied to train a variational autoencoder (VAE). Among these synthetic data, a few of them are fed into the teacher ensemble to query labels via differentially private aggregation, while most of them are embedded to the trained VAE for reconstructing synthetic data. Finally, a semi-supervised student learning is performed to simultaneously handle two tasks: knowledge transfer from the teachers with distillation on few privately labeled synthetic data, and knowledge enhancement with tangent-normal adversarial regularization on many triples of reconstructed synthetic data. In this way, our approach can control query cost over private data and mitigate accuracy degradation in a unified manner, leading to a privacy-preserving student model.

Evacuation systems are of great importance to ensure life safety. Due to panic, people in a building may not be able to make the right judgment to choose an optimal path to leave the building in case of an emergency event such as a fire. As a branch of machine learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can model an evacuation scene, collect real-time information, such as crowd distribution and disaster location, find the optimal escape path with a path-planning algorithm, induce the movement state of the crowd through dynamic guidance signs, and improve the evacuation efficiency. In this article, we apply DRL technology to solve the efficient emergency evacuation problem with the help of metaverse and show a training system built upon metaverse that would enable evacuees to choose the most efficient route and leave the building in the least amount of time. The information collected by various sensors, such as video cameras and smoke detectors, can give a whole picture of the status of the building in a real-time manner. The collected data are processed by cloud servers in which a DRL model is trained to dynamically guide evacuees.

To tackle this issue, this article proposes a geometry-enhanced network with incomplete shape recovery (GER-Net) to estimate the 6D pose of industrial parts. First, an incomplete 3-D shape recovery (ISR) module with a learnable shape protection (SP) layer is introduced to recover the complete 3-D geometry shapes of raw point clouds obtained from depth measurements. Subsequently, the multimodal features extracted from raw RGB-D data are enhanced with the geometry information from the recovered point cloud via multiscale concatenation and recurrent forward fusion in the point cloud space. In this way, the enhanced RGB-D representations contribute to the regression of accurate 6D pose. Experiments on two popular benchmark datasets (LineMOD and Occlusion-LineMOD) show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

The conventional SOH estimation approaches with digital twin are end-of-cycle estimation that require the completion of a full charge/discharge cycle to observe the maximum available capacity. However, under dynamic operating conditions with partially discharged data, it is impossible to sense accurate real-time SOH estimation for LIBs. To bridge this research gap, we put forward a digital twin framework to gain the capability of sensing the battery's SOH on the fly, updating the physical battery model. The proposed digital twin solution consists of three core components to enable real-time SOH estimation without requiring a complete discharge. First, to handle the variable training cycling data, the energy discrepancy-aware cycling synchronization is proposed to align cycling data with guaranteeing the same data structure. Second, to explore the temporal importance of different training sampling times, a time-attention SOH estimation model is developed with data encoding to capture the degradation behavior over cycles, excluding adverse influences of unimportant samples. Finally, for online implementation, a similarity analysis-based data reconstruction has been put forward to provide real-time SOH estimation without requiring a full discharge cycle. Through a series of results conducted on a widely used benchmark, the proposed method yields the real-time SOH estimation with errors less than 1$\%$ for most sampling times in ongoing cycles.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2022.3230698","EMA-EP011-SLEP; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10018489","Battery management system;cycling synchronization;digital twin;machine learning;state of health (SOH) estimation","Estimation;Digital twins;Real-time systems;Batteries;Data models;Degradation;Machine learning","","5","","35","IEEE","17 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Considering the limited energy resource of both MUs and UAVs, we formulate an online problem of resource scheduling to minimize the weighted energy consumption of them. To tackle the difficulty of the combinational problem, we formulate it as a Markov decision process (MDP) with multiple types of agents. Since the proposed MDP has huge state space and action space, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) with Beta distribution and attention mechanism to pursue the optimal computation offloading policy. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme is able to efficiently reduce the energy consumption and outperforms the benchmarks in performance, convergence speed and utilization of resources.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2023.3235997","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101277,62201219,U20B2039); Natural Science Foundation on Frontier Leading Technology Basic Research Project of Jiangsu(grant numbers:BK20212001); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20200822); Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(grant numbers:SKLNST-2021-1-14); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:KYCX22_1204); Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology Students’ Platform for Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program(grant numbers:202210300104Y); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10021296","Mobile edge computing;unmanned aerial vehicle;computation offloading;deep reinforcement learning;digital twin","Computational modeling;Servers;Training;Task analysis;Energy consumption;Real-time systems;Optimization","","6","","36","IEEE","18 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Knowledge distillation demonstrates favorable potential in this case by transferring knowledge from a cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight student model. However, previous distillation methods are plagued with massive misleading background information in remote sensing images and ignore investigating the relationships between different instances. In this article, we propose an instance-aware distillation (InsDist for short) method to derive efficient remote sensing object detectors. Our InsDist combines feature-based and relation-based knowledge distillation to make the most of instance-related information in the knowledge transfer from the teacher to the student. On one hand, we propose a parameter-free masking module to decouple instance-related foreground from instance-irrelevant background in multiscale features. On the other hand, we construct the relationships between different instances to enhance the learning of intraclass compactness and interclass dispersion. The student comprehensively imitates both features and relationships from the teacher, yielding considerable effectiveness in dealing with complex remote sensing images. In addition, our InsDist can be easily built on mainstream object detectors with negligible extra cost. Extensive experiments on two large-scale remote sensing object detection datasets, namely DIOR and DOTA, show that our InsDist obtains noticeable gains over other distillation methods for both one-stage and two-stage, as well as both anchor-based and anchor-free detectors.

Motivated by this constraint and recent advances in S2S learning, we apply the teacher-student framework to recurrent-based S2S- VC models. A major challenge is how to minimize degradation due to the use of causal layers which masks future input information.

In this article, we compare multiple data-driven approaches to forecast the SOC of a BESS based on realistic dataset and real battery operation.

In this paper, we challenge this basic assumption. For final deployment, we often need the model to be small. But small models usually do not have enough capacity to effectively adapt to new tasks. In the mean time, we often have access to the large dataset and extensive computing power during meta-training since meta-training is typically per-formed on a server. In this paper, we propose task-specific meta distillation that simultaneously learns two models in meta-learning: a large teacher model and a small student model. These two models are jointly learned during meta-training. Given a new task during meta-testing, the teacher model is first adapted to this task, then the adapted teacher model is used to guide the adaptation of the student model. The adapted student model is used for final deployment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in few-shot image classification using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML).

Unlike Deep-fake, Out-of-Context misinformation, in which the unaltered unimode contents (e.g. image, text) of a multi-modal news sample are combined in an out-of-context manner to generate deception, requires limited technical expertise to create. Therefore, it is more prevalent a means to confuse readers. Most existing approaches extract features from its uni-mode counterparts to concatenate and train a model for the misinformation classification task. In this paper, we design a self-supervised feature representation learning strategy that aims to attain the multi-task objectives: (1) task-agnostic, which evaluates the intra- and inter-mode representational consistencies for improved alignments across related models; (2) task-specific, which estimates the category-specific multi-modal knowledge to enable the classifier to derive more discriminative predictive distributions. To compensate for the dearth of annotated data representing varied types of misinformation, the proposed Self-Supervised Distilled Learner (SSDL) utilizes a Teacher network to weakly guide a Student network to mimic a similar decision pattern as the teacher. The two-phased learning of SSDL can be summarized as: initial pretraining of the Student model using a combination of contrastive self-supervised task-agnostic objective and supervised task-specific adjustment in parallel; finetuning the Student model via self-supervised knowledge distillation blended with the supervised objective of decision alignment. In addition to the consistent out-performances over the existing baselines that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, the explainability capacity of the proposed SSDL also helps users visualize the reasoning behind a specific prediction made by the model.","2642-9381","978-1-6654-9346-8","10.1109/WACV56688.2023.00284","Advanced Research Projects Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10030784","Applications: Social good;Image recognition and understanding (object detection;categorization;segmentation;scene modeling;visual reasoning);Vision + language and/or other modalities","Representation learning;Training data;Predictive models;Streaming media;Semisupervised learning;Multitasking;Feature extraction","","2","","47","IEEE","6 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One decision boundary exploring technique is to leverage adversarial attack methods, which add crafted perturbations within a ball constraint to clean inputs to create attack examples of the teacher called adversarial examples. These adversarial examples are informative examples because they are near decision boundaries. In this paper, we formulate a teacher adversarial local distribution, a set of all adversarial examples within the ball constraint given an input. This distribution is used to sufficiently explore the decision boundaries of the teacher by covering the full spectrum of possible teacher model perturbations. The student model is then regularized by matching the loss between teacher and student using these adversarial example inputs.

Thereby concerning these problems, the recent development of the vision transformer model has substituted the DL model for classification tasks. However, the high performance of the vision transformer model depends on a large-scale dataset as well as self-attention calculations between the number of image patches which result in a quadratic computational complexity. To address these problems, the vision transformer must be data-efficient to be well-trained with a limited amount of data, and the computational complexity must be linear with the number of image patches. Consequently, this paper presents a novel linear-complexity data-efficient image transformer called LCDEiT for training with small-size datasets by using a teacher-student strategy and linear computational complexity concerning the number of patches using an external attention mechanism. The teacher model comprised a custom gated-pooled convolutional neural network to provide knowledge to the transformer-based student model for the classification of MRI brain tumors. The average classification accuracy and F1-score for two benchmark datasets including Figshare and BraTS-21 are found 98.11% and 97.86% and 93.69% and 93.68% respectively. The results indicate that the proposed model could have a great impact on medical imaging-based diagnosis where data availability and faster computations are the main concern.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3244228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10042403","Brain tumor;classification;external attention;MRI;transformer","Computational modeling;Transformers;Tumors;Image classification;Data models;Feature extraction;Brain modeling","","2","","45","CCBY","13 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we propose an end-to-end optimized teacher-student framework to simultaneously conduct image enhancement and domain adaptation. The student network uses synthetic pairs for supervised enhancement, and regularizes the enhancement model to reduce domain-shift by enforcing teacher-student prediction consistency on the real fundus images without relying on enhanced ground-truth. Moreover, we also propose a novel multi-stage multi-attention guided enhancement network (MAGE-Net) as the backbones of our teacher and student network. Our MAGE-Net utilizes multi-stage enhancement module and retinal structure preservation module to progressively integrate the multi-scale features and simultaneously preserve the retinal structures for better fundus image quality enhancement.

The increased adoption of cyber-physical systems in SM leads to the comprehensive framework of cyber-physical manufacturing systems (CPMS) where data-enabled decision-making mechanisms are coupled with cyber-physical resources on the plant floor. Due to their cyber-physical nature, CPMS are susceptible to cyber-attacks that may cause harm to the manufacturing system, products, or even the human workers involved in this context. Therefore, detecting cyber-attacks efficiently and timely is a crucial step toward implementing and securing high-performance CPMS in practice. This paper addresses two key challenges to CPMS cyber-attack detection. The first challenge is distinguishing expected anomalies in the system from cyber-attacks. The second challenge is the identification of cyber-attacks during the transient response of CPMS due to closed-loop controllers. Digital twin (DT) technology emerges as a promising solution for providing additional insights into the physical process (twin) by leveraging run-time data, models, and analytics. In this work, we propose a DT framework for detecting cyber-attacks in CPMS during controlled transient behavior as well as expected anomalies of the physical process. We present a DT framework and provide details on structuring the architecture to support cyber-attack detection. Additionally, we present an experimental case study on off-the-shelf 3D printers to detect cyber-attacks utilizing the proposed DT framework to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Note to Practitioners—This work is motivated by developing a general-purpose and extensible digital twin-enabled cyber-attack detection framework for manufacturing systems. Existing works in the field consider specialized attack scenarios and models that may not be extensible in practical manufacturing scenarios. We utilize digital twin (DT) technology as a key enabler to develop a systematic and extensible framework where we identify the abnormality of a resource and detect if the abnormality is due to an attack or an expected anomaly. We provide several remarks on how our proposed framework can extend existing industrial control systems (ICS) and can accommodate further extensions. The presented DTs utilize data-driven machine learning models, physics-based models, and subject matter expert knowledge to perform detection and differentiation tasks in the context of expected anomalies and model-based controllers that control the manufacturing process between multiple setpoints.

Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners’ performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners’ final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners’ actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners’ performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners’ action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial in the deep learning model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3249286","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2021R1C1C2004868); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054028","Early performance prediction;learner model;educational games;computational thinking;deep learning","Games;Predictive models;Performance evaluation;Machine learning;Adaptation models;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Education;Learning systems","","","","41","CCBYNCND","27 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Federated learning (FL) is a better privacy-preserving, distributed learning scheme that can be used to model twin models. Although FL can offer performance enhancement, it requires careful design. Therefore, in this article, we present an overview of FL for a twinbased vehicular network. A general architecture for FL-enabled digital twins for a vehicular network is presented. Our proposed architecture consists of two spaces, such as twin space and the physical space. A physical space consists of all the physical entities (e.g., cars and edge servers) required for vehicular networks, whereas, the twin space refers to the logical space that is used for the deployment of twins.

To deal with the lack of annotated training samples for learning deep models in robotics, Sim-to-Real transfer has been invented and widely used. However, such deep models trained in simulation environment typically do not transfer very well to the real world due to the challenging problem of “reality gap”. In response, this letter presents a conceptually new Digital Twin (DT)-CycleGAN framework by integrating the advantages of both DT methodology and the CycleGAN model so that the reality gap can be effectively bridged. Our core innovation is that real and virtual DT robots are forced to mimic each other in a way that the gaps or differences between simulated and realistic robotic behaviors are minimized. To effectively realize this innovation, visual grasping is employed as an exemplar robotic task, and the reality gap in zero-shot Sim-to-Real transfer of visual grasping models is defined as grasping action consistency losses and intrinsically penalized during the DT-CycleGAN training process in realistic simulation environments. Specifically, first, cycle consistency losses between real visual images and simulation images are defined and minimized to reduce the reality gaps in visual appearances during visual grasping tasks. Second, the grasping agent's action consistency losses are defined and penalized to minimize the inconsistency of the grasping agent's actions between the virtual states generated by the DT-CycleGAN generator and the real visual states. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our novel DT-CycleGAN framework for zero-shot Sim-to-Real transfer.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2023.3254460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064001","Grasping;continual learning;computer vision for automation","Grasping;Robots;Visualization;Adaptation models;Cameras;Robot vision systems;Training","","3","","31","CCBY","8 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, such a vanilla loss would unfortunately yield ambiguous feature embeddings for texts of different videos, causing inaccurate cross-modal matching and unreliable retrievals. Toward this end, we propose a multimodal contrastive knowledge distillation method for instance video-text retrieval, called MCKD, by adaptively using the general knowledge of self-supervised model (teacher) to calibrate mixed boundaries. Specifically, the teacher model is tailored for robust (less-ambiguous) visual-text joint semantic space by maximizing mutual information of co-occurred modalities during multimodal contrastive learning. This robust and structural inter-instance knowledge is then distilled, with the help of explicit discrimination loss, to a student model for improved matching performance. Extensive experiments on four public benchmark video-text datasets (MSR-VTT, TGIF, VATEX, and Youtube2Text) demonstrate that our MCKD can achieve at most 8.8%, 6.4%, 5.9%, and 5.3% improvement in text-to-video performance by the  $\text{R}\text{@}1$  metric, compared with 14 SoTA baselines.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2023.3257193","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072465,62172155,62102425,62201014); Science and Technology Innovation Program of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2022RC3061,2021RC2071); Postgraduate Research and Innovation Project of Hunan Province(grant numbers:CX20210080); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10068529","Cross-modal retrieval;contrastive learning;knowledge distillation","Semantics;Videos;Reliability;Task analysis;Electronic mail;Correlation;Annotations","","","","51","IEEE","14 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Aeronautical Ad-hoc Networks (AANETs) take the attention of both industry and academia to satisfy this connectivity requirement with the low cost, easy deployment, and continuous coverage features. On the other hand, the ultra-dynamic characteristics of AANET with unstructured topology make its environment hard-to-follow. Here, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methodologies have an essential role in handling the management complexity of this hard-to-follow environment. However, these methodologies increase the computational complexity of aircraft due to the continuous update, convergence time, and scalability issues. At that point, we propose the utilization of the Digital Twin (DT) technology to handle the management complexity of AANET while solving the main issues of AI-based methodologies on it. The DT can virtually replicate the physical AANET components through closed-loop feedback in real-time. Therefore, this work introduces the utilization of DT technology for the AANET orchestration and, accordingly, proposes a DT-enabled AANET (DT-AANET) topology management framework. This framework consists of the Physical AANET Twin and Controller, including Digital AANET Twin with Operational Module. Here, the Digital AANET Twin virtually represents the physical environment while the operational module executes the AI-based computations on them through unsupervised learning-based training or supervised learning-based prediction.

In this paper, we explore the effects of LC on Cooperative Perception and propose a novel approach to mitigate these effects. Our approach includes an LC-aware Repair Network (LCRN) and a V2V Attention Module (V2VAM) with intra-vehicle attention and uncertainty-aware inter-vehicle attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the public OPV2V dataset (a digital-twin simulated dataset) using point cloud-based 3D object detection. Our results show that our approach improves detection performance under lossy V2V communication.

The machine learning (ML) paradigm provides new methodologies for task assignment. However, ML methods are usually of heavy resource-consumption that cannot be directly applied in the UAV. In this article, a digital-twin (DT)-assisted task assignment approach is proposed to improve the resource-intensive utilization and the efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in multi-UAV system. The approach has a three-layer network structure which can dynamically assign tasks based on the task time constraints. Moreover, the approach is divided into two stages of initial task-assignment and task-reassignment. In the first stage, airship divides a task into multiple subtasks according to the shortest distance based on genetic algorithm and assigns them to UAVs. In the second stage, the DT can be leveraged to enable the airships to learn from the features of tasks and to generate the  $Q$ -value of the estimated value network of DRL for UAVs via pretrain of DT. The  $Q$ -value can be directly applied for deep  $Q$ -learning network (DQN) in the UAVs to reduce the training episode. Furthermore, the DQN is adopted to train task-reassignment strategy. Simulation results indicate that the DQN with DT can significantly reduce the training episode, improving 30% of the task completion ratio and 19% of the system energy efficiency compared with that of the baseline methods.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3263574","Guangxi Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2019GXNSFFA245007); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U22A2054,61971148); Guangxi Key Laboratory of Wireless Wideband Communication and Signal Processing(grant numbers:GXKL06200103); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1807802); Research Grant of University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2020-00107-IOTSC); Guangdong-Macau Joint Laboratory for Advanced and Intelligent Computing(grant numbers:GDST2020B1212030003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10089851","Deep reinforcement learning (DRL);digital twin (DT);multiunmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) system;task assignment","Task analysis;Training;Heuristic algorithms;Internet of Things;Real-time systems;Planning;Energy consumption","","3","","31","CCBY","31 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach is used to prioritize the required Design for Reliability and Maintainability activities during the development phases of health care Systems and Solutions. It is supported by an ‘easy’ and ‘intuitive’ web-based toolset.The presented approach is applicable to product development and continuous improvement of fielded systems. It also serves as an enabler of digital twins for further Availability optimization.The Design for Availability approach starts with modeling of the System and Solution design in the Availability Design Tool, considering existing and new functionalities as well as different maintenance types. This is done in a hierarchal way to manage complexity. Historical data analysis as well as change point analysis are used to predict the Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Life Cycle Cost of the Systems and Solutions under development.Field data on both Reliability as well as Maintainability aspects are obtained via a data pipeline, thereby connecting the web-based Availability Design Tool with the data lake. For non-part related Maintenance activities, work order text analytics with Deep Learning algorithms is used to classify the activities and their impact. This is fed to the Availability model to improve the overall predictive capability of the model.With the Availability model and FMEA as inputs, a qualitative and quantitative analysis is executed to determine the Maintainability and Reliability of critical elements and parts in the proposed design. Easy execution of the FMEA is supported by a web based FMEA tool, allowing clear technical risk identification and prioritization.Based on the criticality analysis, work packages are defined. The work packages contain the Design for Reliability and Maintainability activities required, to ensure that the Systems and Solutions Availability and Life Cycle Cost objectives are met.Upon execution of the Design for Reliability and Maintainability activities, the initial model will require updates because of improved knowledge and understanding of probabilities of failure modes. This is also necessary due to the implemented design changes which mitigate the identified Reliability and Maintainability criticalities; either by preventing failures from occurring, implementation of fault tolerance or fault removal strategies.The approach allows for creating a hierarchical Availability model which includes Hardware as well as Software elements and feeding it with (near real-time) field data. This allows and prepares the model for use as digital twin for further optimization of the Availability of health care Systems and Solutions. The approach can be applied on an individual system as well as on multiple systems; enabled by an easy and free-to-use web-based toolset.","2577-0993","978-1-6654-6053-8","10.1109/RAMS51473.2023.10088264","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10088264","Availability;Reliability & Maintainability applications in Health care","Analytical models;Costs;Statistical analysis;Medical services;Predictive models;Maintenance engineering;Reliability engineering","","","","3","IEEE","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such large-scale CNNs may not be able to be utilized in practice because they require a lot of computational resources. Therefore, there is a need to realize a CNN in a small model that has high performance similar to the large CNN. One method to solve these problems is Distillation, which uses a model of large scale and high performance as the teacher and a small model as the student model, and performs model compression by transferring the knowledge of the teacher model to the student model. However, in distillation, even when the teacher model incorrectly guesses the training input, the student model learns to mimic the teacher. This can prevent the student model from learning better. In this paper, we propose Meritbased Distillation, in which the accuracy of the teacher model’s output determines the degree to which the student model mimics the teacher model’s output, thereby preventing the student to learn undesired mappings. In the experiment, the effect of the Merit-based Distillation is evaluated. Consequently, the proposed method outperforms the improvements in the generalization by the student models trained by other known methods.","","978-1-6654-7692-8","10.1109/CSPA57446.2023.10087390","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10087390","Model compression;Distillation;Hint-based Training;Image classification","Training;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Convolutional neural networks;Task analysis","","","","11","IEEE","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simply put, it is a virtual representation of a physical asset, enabled through data and simulators, that can be used for a variety of purposes such as prediction, monitoring, and decision-making. However, the concept of digital twin can be vague and difficult to understand, which is why a new concept called “capability level” has been introduced. This concept categorizes digital twins based on their capability and defines a scale from zero to five, with each level indicating an increasing level of functionality. These levels are standalone, descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive, and autonomous. By understanding the capability level of a digital twin, we can better understand its potential and limitations. To demonstrate the concepts, we use a modern house as an example. The house is equipped with a range of sensors that collect data about its internal state, which can then be used to create digital twins of different capability levels. These digital twins can be visualized in virtual reality, allowing users to interact with and manipulate the virtual environment. The current work not only presents a blueprint for developing digital twins but also suggests future research directions to enhance this technology. Digital twins have the potential to transform the way we monitor and optimize physical assets, and by understanding their capabilities, we can unlock their full potential.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3265191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10093855","Digital twin;artificial intelligence;virtual reality;machine learning;building physics","Three-dimensional displays;Digital twins;Solid modeling;Data models;Buildings;Rendering (computer graphics);Real-time systems","","2","","63","CCBY","6 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

FSA does not require a special module or network to match features between the teacher model and the student model. By removing the multi-head structure and the repeated self-attention blocks in the existing self-attention mechanism, it minimizes the addition of parameters. Based on ResNet-18, 34, the added parameters are only 2.00M and the training speed is also the fastest in comparison to benchmark models.

In response to the aforementioned dilemma, the social-aware computation offloading system is analyzed, where the digital twin (DT) paradigm is used to simulate tasks offloading and assess the associated costs. Next, to obtain the best offloading choice, we fully consider the social relationship constraints and further propose an online task execution method that includes two stages of cluster selection and computing offloading, named TOFDS.

A typical paradigm among the existing WS-VAD methods is to employ multiple modalities as inputs, e.g., RGB, optical flow, and audio, as they can provide sufficient discriminative clues that are robust to the diverse, complicated real-world scenes. However, such a pipeline has high reliance on the availability of multiple modalities and is computationally expensive and storage demanding in processing long sequences, which limits its use in some applications. To address this dilemma, we propose a privileged knowledge distillation (KD) framework dedicated to the WS-VAD task, which can maintain the benefits of exploiting additional modalities, while avoiding the need for using multimodal data in the inference phase. We argue that the performance of the privileged KD framework mainly depends on two factors: 1) the effectiveness of the multimodal teacher network and 2) the completeness of the useful information transfer. To obtain a reliable teacher network, we propose a cross-modal interactive learning strategy and an anomaly normal discrimination loss, which target learning task-specific cross-modal features and encourage the separability of anomalous and normal representations, respectively. Furthermore, we design both representation-and logits-level distillation loss functions, which force the unimodal student network to distill abundant privileged knowledge from the well-trained multimodal teacher network, in a snippet-to-video fashion. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed privileged KD framework can train a lightweight yet effective detector, for localizing anomaly events under the supervision of video-level annotations.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3263966","Centre for Advances in Reliability and Safety (CAiRS) admitted; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10098140","Privileged knowledge distillation (KD);teacher–student model;video anomaly detection (VAD);weakly supervised learning","Videos;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Training;Knowledge engineering;Anomaly detection;Annotations","","2","","","IEEE","10 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Although existing deep-learning-based anomaly detection methods generally perform well on static data, they struggle to respond timely to streaming data after distribution changes. However, streaming data suffers from conceptual drift due to the highly dynamic nature of IoT. In network security, concept drift-oriented anomaly detection is a crucial task, because it can adjust the model to adapt to the latest data, and detect attacks in time. Existing streaming anomaly detection methods are confronted with some challenges, including the latency of model updates, the uneven importance of new data, and the self-poisoning due to model self-updates. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a knowledge distillation-based adaptive anomaly detection model toward concept drift, ADTCD. ADTCD transfers the knowledge of the teacher model to the student model and only updates the student model to reduce the delay. We construct an algorithm of dynamically adjusting model parameters, which dynamically adjusts model weights through local inference on new samples, in order to improve the model’s responsiveness to new distribution data, meanwhile solving the problem of uneven importance of new data. In addition, we adopt a one-class support vector-based outlier removal method to tackle the self-poisoning problem. In comprehensive experiments on seven high-dimensional data sets, ADTCD achieves an AUC improvement of 12.46% compared to the state-of-the-art streaming anomaly detection methods. Our future direction will focus on exploring the concept-drift problem using methods beyond autoencoders.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3265964","Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2021MF132,ZR2020YQ06); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172244); National Major Program for Technological Innovation 2030-New Generation Artifical Intelligence(grant numbers:2020AAA0107700); Innovation Ability Pormotion Project for Small and Medium-Sized Technology-Based Enterprise of Shandong Province(grant numbers:2022TSGC2098); Pilot Project for Integrated Innovation of Science, Education and Industry of Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences)(grant numbers:2022JBZ01-01); Taishan Scholars Program(grant numbers:tsqn202211210); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10097858","Anomaly detection;concept drift;network security;time series","Anomaly detection;Data models;Adaptation models;Deep learning;Time series analysis;Mathematical models;Computational modeling","","1","","53","IEEE","10 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, we accurately predict the temperature of the furnace by a soft sensor to approximate the billet temperature. Limited by the complexity of the heating process and the lack of computing resources in factories, the existing research pays little attention to or even cannot meet the temperature prediction requirements of multiple heating zones in multiple heating furnaces. To address the above problems, we propose a temperature prediction method for multiheating furnaces based on transfer learning and knowledge distillation. The method establishes a multisource domain model of a source domain furnace on a cloud platform. Then, the multisource knowledge is transferred to the target domain heating furnace, and the target domain teacher model is established by fine-tuning the source domain model through the target domain data. Next, to efficiently predict the furnace temperature, a shallow multitask student model is established at the edge server to predict multiple heating zones in the target furnace. Furthermore, a knowledge distillation method for regression prediction is proposed so that the student model can improve the prediction accuracy under the guidance of the cloud teacher model. The effectiveness of the method is verified by experiments on 20 different heating zone datasets in two heating furnaces and two wind turbine datasets. The consistency of multiple experiments shows that this method cannot only improve the accuracy by transferring the source domain knowledge but also reduce the size of model parameters by knowledge distillation on the premise of meeting the requirements of prediction error.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2023.3267520","Basic Research Program Project of Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:2022000346); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62203431); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10103564","Furnace temperature prediction;knowledge distillation;multitask learning (MTL);transfer learning","Furnaces;Heating systems;Predictive models;Data models;Temperature sensors;Computational modeling;Heat transfer","","1","","43","IEEE","17 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As bootstrapping VMs is time-consuming, a key challenge for latency-critical tasks is to predict future workload demands to provision VMs proactively. However, existing AI-based solutions tend to not holistically consider all crucial aspects such as provisioning overheads, heterogeneous VM costs and Quality of Service (QoS) of the cloud system. To address this, we propose a novel method, called CILP, that formulates the VM provisioning problem as two sub-problems of prediction and optimization, where the provisioning plan is optimized based on predicted workload demands. CILP leverages a neural network as a surrogate model to predict future workload demands with a co-simulated digital-twin of the infrastructure to compute QoS scores. We extend the neural network to also act as an imitation learner that dynamically decides the optimal VM provisioning plan. A transformer based neural model reduces training and inference overheads while our novel two-phase decision making loop facilitates in making informed provisioning decisions. Crucially, we address limitations of prior work by including resource utilization, deployment costs and provisioning overheads to inform the provisioning decisions in our imitation learning framework. Experiments with three public benchmarks demonstrate that CILP gives up to 22% higher resource utilization, 14% higher QoS scores and 44% lower execution costs compared to the current online and offline optimization based state-of-the-art methods.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2023.3268250","President’s PhD scholarship by Imperial College London; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10104137","Resource provisioning;cloud computing;co-simulation;imitation learning","Cloud computing;Optimization;Costs;Quality of service;Predictive models;Time factors;Task analysis","","1","","66","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is great for companies or organizations to display ads based on their user behavior. However, this has an adverse effect on user productivity by spending a lot of time on social media for momentary pleasures. Many organizations have taken additional steps to address this problem, like Apple introduced a new feature in IOS 14, Focus to disable application notifications so people can focus on their work. Similarly, Google added a feature in YouTube to show how much time is spent on YouTube for personal reflection. However, other organizations aren't as socially responsible compared to the above, and they're enticing users to spend more time in the digital world. To address this problem, the same technology empowering ads personalization can be utilized to provide digital learning personalization based on individuals' behavior metrics. This can enable the users of such technology to spend their time based on their own self-improvement goals as part of life-long learning. Therefore in this work, we propose a framework of a conversational digital twin agent that can assist in personalized learning.","","979-8-3503-3531-6","10.1109/iCoMET57998.2023.10099333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099333","Digital twin;life-long learning;personalized recommendations;recommender systems;chatbots;MOOCs","Productivity;Measurement;Video on demand;Social networking (online);Education;Companies;Reflection","","","","23","IEEE","20 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this project, a Recurrent Neural Network model was created to predict human joint accelerations through the automatic digitalization of human body movement using video and acceleration sensors. The project aimed to prevent injuries and fractures in athletes and the elderly population because there is a lack of tools that predicts the risk of these traumas as a preventive method. Acceleration data was collected using Matlab mobile installed in cell phones attached to the arms and legs of volunteers doing physical tasks (walking, running, jumping). Experiments were video recorded, and machine learning models were trained using acceleration and video using Python libraries. After model evaluation, we observed that the selected model could predict the best on the XY axes and the worst on the Z axis, probably due to predicting a three-dimensional feature with a two-dimensional input. A biomechanical Digital Twin was created by combining the information from wearable devices, computer vision, and machine learning algorithms. This tool was able to estimate human joint accelerations (up to an extent) during movements with more refinement; it can help to evaluate movement performance within exercises or tasks and aid in injury/fracture risk prediction.","","978-1-6654-9416-8","10.1109/IEEECONF56852.2023.10104757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10104757","biometrics;machine learning;biomechanics;educational innovation;higher education","Legged locomotion;Biomechanics;Solid modeling;Biological system modeling;Machine learning;Predictive models;Mathematical models","","","","19","IEEE","21 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The low accuracy of teacher models initially trained with limited labeled samples, however, often affects the performance of pseudo-labeling methods. Besides, when the existing consistency regularization methods are applied to vibration signals, there is also the problem that the label information may be damaged due to the difficulty in interpreting the 1-D data augmentation (DA) tool. To address these obstacles, a novel two-stage hybrid SSL method based on grouped pseudo labeling and consistency regularization is developed to generalize mechanical fault diagnosis ability under limited labeled samples. In the first stage, inspired by the label coherence among samples at similar acquisition times, the proposed method fed signal samples with similar acquisition times into the teacher network in groups. Then, the obtained predicted labels are averaged, and a threshold evaluates the validity of the obtained averaged pseudo labels. In the second stage, mixed labeled and remaining grouped unlabeled samples are fed into the student model for supervised and consistency regularization training. In addition, compared with traditional consistency regularization algorithms using mean square error (MSE) metric to estimate label information consistency between the original and related augmented samples, the trace of the covariance matrix is introduced to realize estimating the label information consistency among multiple unlabeled samples in a group.

In this work, we propose a unified and effective semi-supervised learning framework called Mix-Teaching that can be applied to most monocular 3D object detectors. Based on the idea of decomposition and recombination, unlabelled samples are firstly decomposed into collections of image patches with high-quality predictions and collections of background images containing no objects. The student model is then trained on the mixed images containing dense instances with high-quality pseudo-labels generated by the recombination operation. In addition, we propose an uncertainty-based filter to distinguish high-quality pseudo-labels from noisy predictions during the decomposition process. As results in KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks, Mix-Teaching consistently improves MonoFlex and GUPNet by significant margins under various labeling ratios. Our method achieves around +6.34%  $AP_{3D}$  improvement against the GUPNet on the validation set when using only 10% labelled data. Using the full training set and the additional 38K raw images from KITTI, it can further improve the MonoFlex by +4.65% absolute improvement on  $AP_{3D}$  for car detection, reaching 18.54%  $AP_{3D}$ , which ranks the 1st place among all monocular based methods on the KITTI test leaderboard.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2023.3270728","National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFE0204300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62273198,U1964203); China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021M691780); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10108965","Semi-supervised learning;3D object detection;autonomous driving","Three-dimensional displays;Object detection;Training;Semisupervised learning;Noise measurement;Detectors;Databases","","3","","73","IEEE","26 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although these approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various fields such as glucose prediction in type 1 diabetes (T1D), challenges remain in the acquisition of large-scale individual data for personalized modeling due to the elevated cost of clinical trials and data privacy regulations. In this work, we introduce GluGAN, a framework specifically designed for generating personalized glucose time series based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Employing recurrent neural network (RNN) modules, the proposed framework uses a combination of unsupervised and supervised training to learn temporal dynamics in latent spaces. Aiming to assess the quality of synthetic data, we apply clinical metrics, distance scores, and discriminative and predictive scores computed by post-hoc RNNs in evaluation. Across three clinical datasets with 47 T1D subjects (including one publicly available and two proprietary datasets), GluGAN achieved better performance for all the considered metrics when compared with four baseline GAN models. The performance of data augmentation is evaluated by three machine learning-based glucose predictors. Using the training sets augmented by GluGAN significantly reduced the root mean square error for the predictors over 30 and 60-minute horizons. The results suggest that GluGAN is an effective method in generating high-quality synthetic glucose time series and has the potential to be used for evaluating the effectiveness of automated insulin delivery algorithms and as a digital twin to substitute for pre-clinical trials.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2023.3271615","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/P00993X/1); President's Ph.D. Scholarship at Imperial College London, (U.K.); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10114940","Artificial intelligence (AI);continuous glucose monitoring (CGM);diabetes;generative adversarial network (GAN);glucose time series","Glucose;Time series analysis;Insulin;Generative adversarial networks;Monitoring;Data models;Training","Humans;Blood Glucose;Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1;Time Factors;Glucose","2","","53","IEEE","3 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Even if the entire conversation flow is modeled in some work, it is not suitable for real-world task-oriented dialogue systems, where future contexts are not visible until a response is given based on the current dialogue state.

Methods based on the teacher-student model use consistency regularization and uncertainty estimation and have shown good potential in dealing with limited annotated data. Nevertheless, the existing teacher-student model is seriously limited by the exponential moving average algorithm, which leads to the optimization trap. Moreover, the classic uncertainty estimation method calculates the global uncertainty for images but does not consider local region-level uncertainty, which is unsuitable for medical images with blurry regions. In this article, the Voxel Stability and Reliability Constraint (VSRC) model is proposed to address these issues. Specifically, the Voxel Stability Constraint (VSC) strategy is introduced to optimize parameters and exchange effective knowledge between two independent initialized models, which can break through the performance bottleneck and avoid model collapse. Moreover, a new uncertainty estimation strategy, the Voxel Reliability Constraint (VRC), is proposed for use in our semi-supervised model to consider the uncertainty at the local region level. We further extend our model to auxiliary tasks and propose a task-level consistency regularization with uncertainty estimation. Extensive experiments on two 3D medical image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods under limited supervision.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2023.3273609","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62027827,62032022,61929104,61972375); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:Z200027,7222167); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10120761","Semi-supervised learning;medical image segmentation;consistency regularization;uncertainty estimation","Image segmentation;Predictive models;Task analysis;Uncertainty;Medical diagnostic imaging;Training;Bioinformatics","Humans;Reproducibility of Results;Algorithms;Knowledge;Supervised Machine Learning;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","","","45","IEEE","8 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, error-free data are most desirable, but due to extreme operating environments, the possibility of faults occurring in sensors is high. So, detecting faults in data obtained by sensors is important. In this article, a digital twin (DT)-inspired detection approach is proposed, and its ability to detect a single type of fault in several sensors is analyzed. The digital equivalent of the sensor is developed using a generative adversarial network (GAN). As GANs inherently perform well with images, Gramian angular field (GAF) encoding is used to convert time series data to images. The GAF encoding preserves the temporal relations of the time series data. The GAN is trained with the GAF images. The trained GAN model acts as the virtual representation of the sensor, and the discriminator network of the GAN model, once it has learned the pattern of normal data, is used as the fault detector. The performance of the virtual sensor is promising because it successfully generates data for normal conditions. The best fault detection accuracy achieved by the proposed model is 98.7%, which makes this GAN-based DT-inspired approach a promising candidate for sensor fault detection.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2023.3272908","2023 Research Fund of the University of Ulsan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10122519","Deep learning;digital twin (DT)-inspired model;generative adversarial network (GAN);Gramian angular field (GAF);sensor faults","Sensors;Circuit faults;Generative adversarial networks;Fault detection;Sensor systems;Internet of Things;Fault diagnosis","","1","","56","IEEE","9 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For QoT prediction, we further develop a novel neural-network architecture for erbium-doped fiber amplifiers that, after factory training on a single device and with fully loaded configurations only, generalizes to partially loaded configurations seen after deployment and to different gain and tilt settings and other physical devices of the same type. We combine refined parameters and a novel method that predicts the difference in per-channel power when individual services are added or removed or multiple services are lost due to a fiber cut. The impact of error amplification due to cascading of individual components’ models is shown to be reduced, yielding predictions that are substantially more accurate than simply cascaded predictions. As the network ages, the digital twin can be updated by retraining while using only information available in the current network state.","1943-0639","","10.1364/JOCN.487870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10125091","","Optical fiber networks;Load modeling;Digital twins;Predictive models;Gain;Artificial neural networks;Signal to noise ratio","","","","","","16 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For data-driven life prediction model, the model-based DT technology among them offers a significant amount of multi-condition training data. The proposed MRADA fully utilizes the benefits of DT simulation data by using intra-group alignment strategy, inter-group alignment strategy, adversarial learning, and regressor alignment strategy to learn domain-invariant features and supervision from multiple sources.

We formulate a contextual reinforcement learning problem to learn a human-like and stochastic policy with domain-informed choices for states, actions, and reward functions. To leverage very limited training data and build human-like diverse behavior, we fit a probabilistic model to the expert demonstrations called the reference distribution, draw samples out of it, and use them as context for the reinforcement learning agent with context-specific states and rewards. In contrast to the non-human-like stochasticity introduced by Gaussian noise, our method contributes to a more effective exploration, better performance and a policy with human-like variance in evaluation metrics. Compared to previous work using a behavioral cloning agent, which is unable to complete competitive laps robustly, our agent outperforms the professional driver used to collect the demonstrations by around 0.4 seconds per lap on average, which is the first time known to the authors that an autonomous agent has outperformed a top-class professional race driver in a state-of-the-art, high-fidelity simulation. Being robust and sensitive to vehicle setup changes, our agent is able to predict plausible lap time and other performance metrics.

It enables a student model to distill knowledge from the teacher’s predictions of extra unlabeled data. However, such knowledge flow is typically unidirectional, having the accuracy vulnerable to the quality of teacher model. In this paper, we seek to robust 3D reconstruction of stereo endoscopic images by proposing a novel fashion of bidirectional learning between two learners, each of which can play both roles of teacher and student concurrently. Specifically, we introduce two self-supervisions, i.e., Adaptive Cross Supervision (ACS) and Adaptive Parallel Supervision (APS), to learn a dual-branch convolutional neural network. The two branches predict two different disparity probability distributions for the same position, and output their expectations as disparity values. The learned knowledge flows across branches along two directions: a cross direction (disparity guides distribution in ACS) and a parallel direction (disparity guides disparity in APS). Moreover, each branch also learns confidences to dynamically refine its provided supervisions. In ACS, the predicted disparity is softened into a unimodal distribution, and the lower the confidence, the smoother the distribution. In APS, the incorrect predictions are suppressed by lowering the weights of those with low confidence. With the adaptive bidirectional learning, the two branches enjoy well-tuned mutual supervisions, and eventually converge on a consistent and more accurate disparity estimation. The experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate our superior accuracy over other state-of-the-arts with a relative decrease of averaged disparity error by at least 9.76%.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2023.3279899","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62202189); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFE0200600); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2021XXJS033); Research Grants from Wuhan United Imaging Healthcare Surgical Technology Company Ltd; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10136208","Semi-supervised learning;stereo matching;endoscopic images","Estimation;Three-dimensional displays;Predictive models;Training;Image reconstruction;Adaptation models;Data models","Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Endoscopy;Neural Networks, Computer;Probability;Supervised Machine Learning","","","43","IEEE","25 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, conventional systems are typically built on the assumption that all modalities exist, and the lack of modalities always leads to poor inference performance. Furthermore, extracting pretrained embeddings for all modalities is computationally inefficient for inference. In this work, to achieve high efficiency-performance multimodal transfer learning, we propose VideoAdviser, a video knowledge distillation method to transfer multimodal knowledge of video-enhanced prompts from a multimodal fundamental model (teacher) to a specific modal fundamental model (student). With an intuition that the best learning performance comes with professional advisers and smart students, we use a CLIP-based teacher model to provide expressive multimodal knowledge supervision signals to a RoBERTa-based student model via optimizing a step-distillation objective loss—first step: the teacher distills multimodal knowledge of video-enhanced prompts from classification logits to a regression logit—second step: the multimodal knowledge is distilled from the regression logit of the teacher to the student. We evaluate our method in two challenging multimodal tasks: video-level sentiment analysis (MOSI and MOSEI datasets) and audio-visual retrieval (VEGAS dataset). The student (requiring only the text modality as input) achieves an MAE score improvement of up to 12.3% for MOSI and MOSEI. Our method further enhances the state-of-the-art method by 3.4% mAP score for VEGAS without additional computations for inference. These results suggest the strengths of our method for achieving high efficiency-performance multimodal transfer learning.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3280187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10136716","Multimodal transfer learning;knowledge distillation;fundamental model","Data models;Task analysis;Visualization;Transfer learning;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Sentiment analysis","","","","59","CCBYNCND","26 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nowadays unsupervised person re-identification methods have achieved great progress by training with pseudo labels. However, how to purify feature and label noise is less explicitly studied in the unsupervised manner. To purify the feature, we take into account two types of additional features from different local views to enrich the feature representation. The proposed multi-view features are carefully integrated into our cluster contrast learning to leverage more discriminative cues that the global feature easily ignored and biased. To purify the label noise, we propose to take advantage of the knowledge of teacher model in an offline scheme. Specifically, we first train a teacher model from noisy pseudo labels, and then use the teacher model to guide the learning of our student model. In our setting, the student model could converge fast with the supervision of the teacher model thus reduce the interference of noisy labels as the teacher model greatly suffered. After carefully handling the noise and bias in the feature learning, our purification modules are proven to be very effective for unsupervised person re-identification. Extensive experiments on two popular person re-identification datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

In this paper, we propose a novel packet loss inferring framework that can train lightweight models to distinguish between channel losses and collisions by learning the data trace from both simulation and real devices.

Deep learning-based methods have shown great potential in this field compared to traditional methods that rely on hand-crafted features. However, deep learning-based methods for railway point clouds still face typical challenges that need to be addressed. In this regard, we propose a novel learning framework named SALAProNet, which consists of a set of effective and concise modular solutions. The first challenge addressed is the massive data scale of railway point clouds, which makes it difficult to directly process large-scale point clouds due to memory limitations. To solve this problem, we adapt efficient random sampling in the network and propose the Self-Attentive Aggregation (SAA) module based on an attention mechanism to greatly expand the receptive field, which covers the unsampled points and successfully retains information in a high-dimensional feature space. The second challenge is fine-grained segmentation, where we propose the Local Geometry Embedding (LGE) module to embed local geometry. With the help of context information provided by SAA, the network can perform fine-grained segmentation for railway infrastructures. The third challenge is the insufficient generalization ability of the network, where we propose a Prototype Guided Regularization (PGR) method to guide the network to segment the point cloud among railways with different construction standards. This method enhances the network’s interpretability and improves its generalization ability. We have validated our proposed framework through experiments on different datasets, and it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3281352","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB4300601); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61833002); Research Project of State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety(grant numbers:RCS2022ZT005); Research Project of China State Railway Group Company Ltd.(grant numbers:P2022X001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10144473","Attention mechanism;digital twin;high-speed railway;infrastructure;point cloud semantic segmentation;prototype guided regularization","Point cloud compression;Rail transportation;Semantic segmentation;Wires;Geometry;Three-dimensional displays;Semantics","","","","46","IEEE","5 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Emotion recognition in healthcare is becoming increasingly important due to recent developments in Machine Learning methods. However, it may face technical problems such as limited datasets, occlusion and lighting issues, identifying key features, incorrect emotion classification, high implementation costs, head posture, and a person’s cultural background. This paper proposes a novel approach based on facial expression and body movement recognition for emotion recognition. It uses three devices (Kinect 1, Kinect 2, and RGB HD camera) to construct a new bi-modal database containing 17 participants’ performances of six emotional states. Two mono-modal classifiers have been developed to obtain sufficient state information based on facial expression and body motion analysis. The system’s performance is assessed using three algorithms: Bagged Trees,  $k$ -Nearest Neighbors ( $k$ -NN), and Support Vector Machine (Linear and Cubic). The acquired findings demonstrate the excellent performance of the suggested method and the effectiveness of the proposed features, particularly the combination of 3D distance and 3D angle, in characterising and identifying emotions. Results obtained using Kinect 2 marginally surpass those with Kinect 1. Comparing 2D RGB and RGB-D data reveals that the depth information significantly raises the recognition rate. RGB-D features can be used to represent emotions, but there are discrepancies between RGB and RG-D data.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3285398","SAFE_RH Project(grant numbers:ERASMUS+ CBHE-619483-EPP-1-2020-1-UK-EPPKA2-CBHE); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10148978","Body movement;classification;emotion recognition;facial expression;geometrical feature;healthcare;human digital twin;RGB;RGB-D;virtual reality","Emotion recognition;Digital twins;Feature extraction;Face recognition;Biomedical monitoring;Three-dimensional displays;Cameras","","1","","49","CCBYNCND","12 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the technology depends heavily on dataset labels, leading to high annotation costs. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel efficient end-to-end hybrid consistency regularization algorithm (EI-HCR) for the semisupervised semantic segmentation of RSI, wherein only a few labeled images and a large number of unlabeled images are effectively used. First, we devise data perturbation (DP) consistency regularization (CR), which includes a data mix-up method to combine unlabeled and labeled images. Then, we employ teacher and student networks to conduct model perturbation (MP) CR. Both segmentation results are regarded as pseudo-labels for each other. In the end, the semisupervised loss is composed of DP and MP consistency loss and supervises network training along with the fully supervised loss. More importantly, we first combine the characteristics of knowledge distillation to make the student network more lightweight, efficiently reducing the model inference time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EI-HCR on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Massachusetts Buildings datasets. With only 5% of the labeled images, EI-HCR can achieve the same accuracy as the fully supervised training with 50% of the labeled images, and the number of student model parameters is only 9.64 M, indicating the method’s great advantages over other algorithms.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3285752","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61725501); Key Laboratory of Precision Opto-Mechatronics Technology, Ministry of Education, Beihang University, China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10153098","Consistency regularization (CR);knowledge distillation;remote sensing image (RSI);semantic segmentation;semisupervised learning","Training;Perturbation methods;Semantic segmentation;Remote sensing;Data models;Generative adversarial networks;Semantics","","1","","53","IEEE","14 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study provides a framework to develop a digital twin for vibration prediction and fatigue life prognosis of a vertical oil well drillstring. The nature and the severity of the down-hole vibrations are identified and estimated based on the vibrational and operational parameter measurements made at the surface level. Because of the difficulty in accessing full-scale industrial drilling data, a reduced-scale drillstring was constructed that could exhibit bit bounce, stick-slip and whirl. A bond graph simulation model was tuned to match the apparatus, and then used to generate synthetic training data. The trained machine learning algorithm can classify the incoming surface monitoring data from the physical twin into different types and severities of vibration states which are not otherwise observable. Moreover, the classified vibration condition is used to re-configure the bond graph model with appropriate complexity to generate a loading history for fatigue life prognosis. The fatigue life estimation uses a novel combination of a low-complexity model of the entire drillstring and a high fidelity finite element model of components where stress concentrations are most severe. The digital twin detected the vibration type and its severity and estimated the remaining fatigue life of the physical system using only measurements of the motor current, rig floor axial vibration, and rotary speed.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3287864","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN), Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10156837","Digital twin;bond graph;hidden Markov model;surface monitoring;drillstring","Vibrations;Digital twins;Drilling;Vibration measurement;Machine learning algorithms;Fatigue;Monitoring","","1","","39","CCBY","20 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two amalgamation mechanisms, feature amalgamation and structure amalgamation, are designed from different perspectives, so that the model can generalize better and run fast. Specifically, the feature amalgamation transfers the high-level sematic knowledge from two teacher models to the compact model. The structure amalgamation employs the adversarial learning to ensure the global structure consistency of two teacher models and a student model.

Then, the DT is used for the diagnosis and tolerance of open-switch faults (OSFs) and faults related to voltage and current sensors or for sensorless control. The OSF detection and localization algorithm is implemented based on the dynamic response difference between the physical system and its DT. First, the OSF is detected and localized based on the grid current dynamics, where each switch fault generates a specific pattern in the current dynamics. OSF is tolerated by changing the switching function based on the location of the fault. Second, the voltage and current sensor fault is detected when the DT provides a specific amplitude of currents while the physical sensors do not provide a correct measurement. This case is tolerated by feeding back the grid currents or voltages from the DT as an alternative to the physical sensors.

However, each method has its characteristics and limitations, so they cannot always handle noise well. Besides, the requirements of clean speech and noise data for training a supervised speech enhancement model are difficult to satisfy in the real-world airborne environment. Therefore, in this work, to fully utilize the advantages of those two different methods without any data restrictions, we propose a novel adaptive gain mask (AGM) based teacher-student training approach for speech enhancement. In our method, the AGM, as a robust learning target for the student model, is devised by incorporating the estimated ideal ratio mask from the teacher model into the procedure of the log-MMSE approach. To get an appropriate tradeoff between the two methods, we adaptively update the AGM using a recursive weighting coefficient. Experiments on the real airborne data show that the proposed AGM-based method outperforms other baselines in terms of all essential objective metrics evaluated in this paper.","2075-5597","","10.23919/cje.2022.00.307","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:D5000210974); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10168798","Adaptive ideal mask;Teacher-student learning;Long short-term memory (LSTM);Speech enhancement","Training;Measurement;Deep learning;Adaptation models;Atmospheric modeling;Mean square error methods;Interference","","1","","40","","29 Jun 2023","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

The learner model, which is a representation of different learner’s characteristics, plays a key role in this adaptation. Research on educational psychology showed that emotion and learning have a hidden mutual relationship. If a learning process involves both cognitive and affective dimensions, then learning is like to be more usable, socially appropriate, acceptable and memorable, ultimately leading to significant improvement in the learner’s performance and the learning experience. However, traditional ITS ignore emotional aspects in learner modelling mostly; instead, they focus on learners’ cognition and motivation to maximise the knowledge to be achieved. The characteristics related to cognition are not well defined and primarily sparse when modelling a learner profile tailored to the learning domains. This study attempts to investigate the most common and relevant personal traits involved in the learning process based on the domains of learning. It also explores the most adopted techniques to identify such traits from log files of learners’ interactions with ITS without using physical and physiological sensors (i.e., camera, EEG) to model characteristics learner profiles for ITS aiming to improve its adaptiveness and leverage personalised learning.","2836-4317","979-8-3503-4731-9","10.1109/ISCAIE57739.2023.10165219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10165219","adaptive learning;learner modelling;intelligent tutoring systems;affective computing;emotion in learning.","Learning systems;Industrial electronics;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Psychology;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Brain modeling","","","","60","IEEE","3 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, transformers with self-attention mechanisms have demonstrated superior performance compared with CNNs. However, due to the locality of CNN and the high computational complexity and massive data resource requirements of transformer, neither of them can be well applied in resource-constrained practical remote sensing scenarios. Motivated by the limitations of using either CNNs or transformers alone in the task of semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, a novel cross-model knowledge distillation (KD) framework, named distilling segmenters from CNNs and transformers (DSCTs), is proposed in this article to harness the complementary advantages of both the models. The framework uses a channel-weighted attention-guided feature distillation (CAFD) module to condense the feature from the teacher model and enhance the student model’s focus on the teacher-focused regions. In addition, a target–nontarget KD (TNKD) module is proposed that decouples logit distillation into target and nontarget KD to guide the student model in learning the underlying representations and decision boundaries from the teacher model. By learning the complementary knowledge from the teacher, our proposed DSCT framework improves the student’s segmentation performance without adding trainable parameters. Experiments on four available remote sensing datasets (ISPRS Potsdam, Vaihingen, GID, and LoveDA) indicate that the proposed DSCT outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods and demonstrates its effectiveness and robustness.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3290411","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022ZD0118401); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10173477","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);knowledge distillation (KD);remote sensing images;semantic segmentation;transformer","Transformers;Task analysis;Remote sensing;Semantic segmentation;Computer vision;Decoding;Convolutional neural networks","","3","","68","IEEE","4 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Deep learning model algorithms and a large amount of data make deep learning an effective tool to solve practical problems. However, in the current centralized deep learning model of a large number of client-server models, when we upload our data for training on the server side, there is a risk of leaking privacy. Federated Learning is a type of distributed machine learning that allows multiple institutions or individuals to learn collaboratively without exchanging data. Users only upload their model parameters, and the server aggregates the model parameters of each user into a global model and returns it to the client, and the client updates its local model according to the global model to achieve the global optimal solution, avoiding leakage of private data. However, attackers can still restore user data by obtaining uploaded model parameters from users, which leads to the fact that only transmitting model parameters cannot protect user privacy. Therefore, the issue of privacy protection has become the focus of federated learning. In this paper, the CSP (conjugate search problem) fully homomorphic encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the user model parameters. The CSP encrypt algorithm will not cause the loss of model performance, and at the same time has the characteristics of fast encryption speed, which is very suitable for application in the field of machine learning.","2767-9861","979-8-3503-2105-0","10.1109/DDCLS58216.2023.10167059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10167059","Deep learning;federated learning;privacy protection;CSP homomorphic encryption","Deep learning;Training;Data privacy;Machine learning algorithms;Federated learning;Data models;Classification algorithms","","","","8","IEEE","7 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The existing scheduling system cannot realize the information interaction and collaborative integration between the physical world and the virtual world, while the digital twin (DT) technology can effectively solve the problem of real-time information interaction and the reinforcement learning (RL) method can cope with dynamic scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposed a DT-driven RL method to solve the marine equipment vehicle scheduling problem. Given the dynamic nature of transportation tasks, the diversity of transported goods, and the optimization characteristics of transportation requirements, a framework for scheduling transportation vehicle operations based on DT is constructed, and a RL-based vehicle scheduling method in a dynamic task environment is proposed. A Markov decision process (MDP) model of the vehicle scheduling process is established to realize one-to-one mapping between information and physical elements. An improved RL method based on Q-learning is proposed to solve the MDP model, and the value function approximation and convergence enhancement methods are applied to optimize the solving process. Finally, a case study is used for example verification to prove the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper. Note to Practitioners—The motivation of this paper is to optimize material transportation vehicle scheduling in dynamic task environments and to improve logistics transportation efficiency. Therefore, a DT-based vehicle scheduling method for marine equipment is proposed. Firstly, a framework of vehicle scheduling based on DT is designed to establish a MDP model of the vehicle scheduling process, and the dynamic task characteristics are described by mathematical methods in the design of the elements of the model.

Each slice operates independently with its own dedicated resources, configuration, and management. However, this poses a major challenge in guaranteeing optimal resource allocation among those slices while preserving the obligatory Quality of Service (QoS) levels for each one. This study presents a federated learning-driven digital twin (DT) framework named FED-DT for creating a digital replica of the physical slicing-supported network to mimic its complicated infrastructure and forecast the network's dynamic performance. In FED-DT, the DT of network slicing is designated as non-Euclidean graph representations. A novel lightweight Graph Lineformer Network (GLN) is introduced to collaboratively learn and estimate QoS metrics from the topological structures of the underlying network slices. The FED-DT is empowered with an intelligent self-supervision method to improve generalizability on a large network, while Gaussian Differential Privacy (DP) is applied to guarantee the preservation of model privacy during training. Proof-of-concept simulations on different network topologies demonstrate the effectiveness of FED-DT in fulfilling rigid QoS requirements and achieving ideal performance.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.003.2200609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10179152","","Quality of service;Network topology;Measurement;Resource management;Communication networks;Training;Topology","","","","15","IEEE","11 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

To demonstrate the viability and potential of such approach, a measurement campaign is conducted on MEC nodes deployed with different virtualization environments (bare metal, virtual machine, and containerized), and the results are used to build the DT of each node. Furthermore, machine learning models, including k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), and polynomial fitting (PF), are used to understand the amount of actual measurements required to achieve a suitably low KPI prediction error.

In fact, there exists two main issues which should be well addressed: data imbalance between high and low action-frequency videos, and inferior detection of short actions in high-action-frequency videos. To address the above issues, we propose an effective framework by adapting to the variability of action frequency, namely Action Frequency Adaptive Network (AFAN), which can be flexibly built upon any temporal action proposal generation method. AFAN consists of two modules: Learning From Experts (LFE) and Fine-Grained Processing (FGP). The LFE first trains a series of action proposal generators on different subsets of imbalanced data as experts and then teaches a unified student model via knowledge distillation. To better detect short actions, FGP first finds out high-action-frequency videos and then performs fine-grained detection.

Our approach leverages the concept of substage-based learning to distill knowledge based on the combination of student substages and the correlation of corresponding substages. We also employ the progressive cascade training method to address the accuracy loss caused by the large capacity gap between the teacher and the student. Additionally, we propose a pseudo-label optimization strategy to improve the initial data label. To optimize the loss functions of different distillation substages during the training process, we introduce a new loss method based on feature distribution.

To address this issue, we propose a Cognitive-digital-twin-based Driving Assistance System (CDAS) that issues warnings tailored to the driver's perception of the driving environment and driving style. In this letter, we present a model of the driver's decision-making process that explicitly captures their perception of the driving environment, their utility evaluation of predicted future environments, and their driving style in terms of minimum acceptable risk. The cognitive digital twin of the driver is then created and updated by minimizing the discrepancy between the predicted and actual behaviors of the driver. With the cognitive digital twin, the CDAS warns the driver when there is a significant discrepancy between the predicted driving strategy based on partial observation and that based on full observation. This approach can more accurately identify risks that the driver is not aware of and provide warnings only when necessary. We conducted human and simulated experiments in a virtual driving environment, and our results demonstrate that our proposed CDAS has a similar perception of risky behaviors compared to humans. Furthermore, the digital twin learning framework can identify the driving styles of human participants and accurately predict their driving strategies. Additionally, our proposed cognitive driving assistance system provides fewer false warnings and avoids more collisions compared to state-of-the-art ADAS algorithms.

To mitigate this domain shift, we introduce a unified alignment pretraining framework into the vanilla pretrain-finetune pipeline, that has both instance- and knowledge-level alignments. Specifically, we first devise a novel coarse-to-fine retrieval sampling approach to select target domain-related instances from the large-scale pretraining dataset, thus aligning the instances between pretraining and the target domains (First Stage). Then, we introduce a knowledge guidance-based strategy to further bridge the domain gap at the knowledge level. In practice, we formulate the model pretrained on the sampled instances into a knowledge guidance model and a learner model. On the target dataset, we design an on-the-fly teacher-student joint fine-tuning approach to progressively transfer the knowledge from the knowledge guidance model to the learner model (Second Stage). Therefore, the learner model can maintain more domain-invariant knowledge when learning new knowledge from the target dataset. In the Third Stage, the learner model is finetuned to better adapt its learned knowledge to the target dataset.

The proposed approach takes advantage of the DT-based reference model as well as the physical characteristics of the radial distribution network to compute a new metric, namely Residual Rate of Change (RRC), which allows differentiating False Data Injection (FDI) attacks on load measurements and protective devices. The RRC enables the determination of the attack's location by constructing a directed graph that characterizes the physical dependencies of protective devices. The proposed attack localization method is implemented on a testbed consisting of a digital real-time simulator, feeder protection devices, a real-time automation controller, and advanced communication infrastructure for a power distribution system. The provided experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method to localize cyber attacks in various operation scenarios of the power distribution system.

On the other hand, federated learning (FL), which focuses on privacy protection, also faces challenges such as core network congestion and limited mobile device (MD) resources. The computation offloading technology of mobile edge computing (MEC) can effectively alleviate these challenges, but it ignores the effect of user mobility and the unpredictable MEC environment. In this paper, we first propose an architecture that combines digital twin (DT) and MEC technologies with the FL framework, where the DT network can virtually imitate the statue of physical entities (PEs) and network topology to be used for real-time data analysis and network resource optimization. The computation offloading technology of MEC is used to alleviate resource constraints of MDs and the core network congestion. We further leverage the FL to construct DT models based on PEs’ running data. Then, we jointly optimize the problem of computation offloading and resource allocation to reduce the straggler effect in FL based on the framework. Since the solution of the objective function is a stochastic programming problem, we model a Markov decision process (MDP), and use the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to solve this objective function.

One such type of perception data are evidential occupancy grid maps (OGMs). The computation of a digital twin involves their spatiotemporal alignment and fusion. In this work, we focus on the spatial alignment, also known as registration, and fusion of evidential occupancy grid maps of multiple automated vehicles. While there exists extensive research on the synchronization and fusion of object-based environment representations, the registration and fusion of OGMs originating from multiple connected vehicles has not been investigated much. We propose a methodology that involves training a deep neural network (DNN) to predict a fused evidential OGM from two OGMs computed by different AVs. The output includes an estimate of the first- and second-order uncertainty. We demonstrate that the DNN trained with synthetic data only outperforms a baseline approach based on coordinate transformation and combination rules also on real-world data.

In AR-assisted driving, physical environment scenes are first captured by AR vehicles and are uploaded to the Metaverse for the construction of the Metaverse Map. However, the development of AR-assisted driving applications invites adversaries. These attackers may place adversarial patches on physical objects, seeking to contort the Metaverse Map. As real-time, accurate detection of adversarial patches is compute-intensive, these physical world scenes have to be offloaded to the Metaverse Map Base Station (MMBS) for computation. Therefore, we considered a scenario where AR vehicles capture physical world scenes and upload these scenes in real-time to the MMBSs. We formulated an optimization problem where the MMSP’s objective is to maximize adversarial patch detection mean Average Precision (mAP), while minimizing the computed AR scene uplink transmission latency and minimizing the worst-case (largest) AR vehicle’s uplink transmission battery charge consumption, through optimizing the AR vehicle-MMBS allocation, AR vehicle uplink scene resolution selection, and AR vehicle uplink power output selection.

In order to tackle these issues, based on knowledge distillation (KL), this article proposes an effective lightweight defect detection network (KD-LightNet) suitable for edge scenes. First of all, a LightNet is designed based on structure reparameterization, which can sufficiently improve the capability of network feature extraction and reduce the complexity of model inferring. Moreover, a well-prepared self-distillation strategy is proposed, which utilizes the pretrained LightNet network as a teacher model to transfer knowledge in the same structure. Then, in order to fully utilize the logits predicted by the teacher model, an improved KL divergence loss is proposed to enhance the accuracy of the student model. Finally, in the experiments, three industrial datasets (PKU-Market-PCB, NEU-DET, and Magnetic tile defect dataset) were used to validate the proposed model performance. The KD-LightNet detection accuracy (mAP) is improved by an average of 6.87%, while the average detection speed reaches 72 frames/s at 3070Ti (Params 4.7 M), which meets the requirements of industrial defect detection accuracy and real-time.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2023.3300421","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21A20481,61973071); LiaoNing Revitalization Talents Program(grant numbers:XLYC2002046); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10198385","Deep learning;defect detection;knowledge distill (KL);lightweight network (LightNet)","Computational modeling;Knowledge engineering;Feature extraction;Convolution;Training;Periodic structures;Neck","","1","","35","IEEE","1 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This goes beyond traditional smart solutions by replicating, with high fidelity cross-domain aspects, a physical object into the digital world. The key differentiation is the inclusion of semantics information in the digital replica in a form of knowledge graph. Further, analytics continuously enrich Digital Twin’s information with predictions and insights. In this article, we adopt the Digital Twin approach for the creation of a digital replica of Espinardo’s campus at the University of Murcia (Spain). The starting point is the existing sensor network deployment and the infrastructure under development of Fog-Edge-Cloud computing based on a 5G private network. The smart campus Digital Twin is formed by the Digital Twins of 23 buildings for which different sets of data features have been thoroughly selected.

However, many previous knowledge distillation methods are designed for image classification and fail in more challenging tasks such as object detection. In this paper, we first suggest that the failure of knowledge distillation on object detection is mainly caused by two reasons: (1) the imbalance between pixels of foreground and background and (2) lack of knowledge distillation on the relation among different pixels. Then, we propose a structured knowledge distillation scheme, including attention-guided distillation and non-local distillation to address the two issues, respectively. Attention-guided distillation is proposed to find the crucial pixels of foreground objects with an attention mechanism and then make the students take more effort to learn their features. Non-local distillation is proposed to enable students to learn not only the feature of an individual pixel but also the relation between different pixels captured by non-local modules. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method on thirteen kinds of object detection models with twelve comparison methods for both object detection and instance segmentation. For instance, Faster RCNN with our distillation achieves 43.9 mAP on MS COCO2017, which is 4.1 higher than the baseline. Additionally, we show that our method is also beneficial to the robustness and domain generalization ability of detectors.

RL is able to learn the optimal policy via interacting with a specific environment. However, it has been observed that RL is very sensitive to environment change, mainly because the environment variation disturbs RL training/learning. A possible approach is to execute the RL process in the DT using snapshots of the environment (parameters), and update the parameters at a proper frequency. The DT-RL bundled approach takes advantage of computing resources in the DT, speeds up the process and saves battery energy of the flying base station, and more importantly, mitigates the nonstationary impact on RL. Specifically, the use case is about quickly connecting mobile users with an aerial bass station. The base station is autonomously and optimally placed according to a predefined criterion to connect scattered slow-movement users. Q-learning, a common type of RL, is employed as a solution to the optimization of base station placement. Tailored for this application, a two-stage base station placement algorithm is proposed and evaluated. For the configuration considered in this paper, numerical results suggest that 1) the Q-learning algorithm run solely in the physical space does not work due to intolerable time consuming and optimization divergence, and 2) the proposed scheme can catch up with random slow movement of mobile users, and tolerate certain measurement and model errors. With necessary modification and extension, the proposed framework could be applied to other DT-assisted cyber-physical systems.","2770-162X","979-8-3503-3902-4","10.1109/ISORC58943.2023.00042","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10196824","Aerial/flying base station;digital twin (DT);reinforcement learning (RL);Q-learning","Base stations;Q-learning;Measurement uncertainty;Time measurement;Digital twins;Optimization;Tuning","","","","13","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although current healthcare systems generate abundant digital data, this data is frequently fragmented, stored in multiple locations, organized according to various structures, and lacks context, posing a challenge for integrating and utilizing these data to model the relevant conditions. Effective AI medical solutions, we argue, necessitate the development of an AI-specific medical vocabulary, which we call information tokens. The proposed vocabulary would enable AI methods to access diverse medical records and provide the context for developing treatment models, instead of only conditions-specific models.

Such data streams are usually subject to non-stationary phenomena, causing that the data distribution of the streams may change, and thus the knowledge captured by models used for data analysis may become obsolete (leading to the so-called concept drift effect). The early detection of the change (drift) is crucial for updating the model’s knowledge, which is challenging especially in scenarios where the ground truth associated to the stream data is not readily available. Among many other techniques, the estimation of the model’s confidence has been timidly suggested in a few studies as a criterion for detecting drifts in unsupervised settings.

To address this issue, we propose Deeply-Supervised Knowledge Distillation (DSKD), which fully utilizes class predictions and feature maps of the teacher model to supervise the training of shallow student layers.

Specifically, real situations reflecting complex relationships between objects, results from real situations have to be adaptive to convergence situations and then it should be possible to draw conclusions and make decisions that are not limited to specific situations. So, it is essential to conduct AI based study and analysis by considering these real world characteristics to provide digital twin services based on metaverse. Recently, there are many studies on Graph Neural Network(GNN) and services applied to GNN for learning the relationship between objects detected in real situations. Accordingly, this paper proposes a metaverse-based Digital Twin Convergence Service(DTCS) including spatial elements strategy that is possible to draw accurate conclusions in a changing convergence situation. DTCS is able to conduct causal reasoning and association learning between objects considering directions and distances change characteristics between objects and this is possible to make correct solution and decision making in the process of simulation and analysis of digital twin. In that DTCS proceeds by considering distance and changing angle between objects, this overcomes the limitation of existing GNN which only considers the degree of association or assigns the same parameters to connected objects.

Mainstream methods suffer from the data scarcity of novel classes with insufficient intra-class variations, which makes the trained model biased to base classes. Actually, there are massive unlabeled novel instances in the base dataset and their adequate utilization will enhance the discriminability of model to novel classes. This paper proposes a semi-supervised few-shot object detection method, which utilizes a teacher model and a pre-trained few-shot object detector to guide the learning of a student model through adaptive pseudo labeling. In particular, a class-adaptive threshold filtering (CATF) strategy is designed to deal with the class-imbalance problem of pseudo labels. And for each novel class, the threshold to select valuable pseudo labels is determined by quantile statistics of the confidence score distribution of pseudo labels. Furthermore, the pre-trained detector and the teacher model are associated with the preliminary CATF and in-depth CATF, respectively, and then the pseudo labels from the two-stream CATF are fused to provide supervisions. In this way, the knowledge of these two models is exploited, which improves the quality of pseudo labels. Under these supervisions, the student model is trained and the teacher model is correspondingly updated through parameters sharing, thus forming a positive feedback to improve the performance of both models. Besides, an attention module is integrated to the teacher and student models to enhance the feature representation of novel instances. The validations on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2023.3301854","Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022MQ05); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62073322); CIE-Tencent Robotics X Rhino-Bird Focused Research Program(grant numbers:2022-07); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10208219","Few-shot object detection;adaptive pseudo labeling;semi-supervised learning","Adaptation models;Object detection;Data models;Training;Detectors;Labeling;Feature extraction","","","","","IEEE","4 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, there is a part of the IMD that is not missing in any view, and most previous methods have not utilized this part to guide the process of learning consensus information. To address this issue, we design a knowledge distillation framework for incomplete multi-view clustering and propose an incomplete multi-view clustering with complete view guidance (IMC-CVG). We first train a robust teacher model with contrastive learning loss on the complete part of IMD to learn consensus features containing multi-view information. Then, we train a student model on all the IMD, where we mask partial views of the complete data to simulate missing data, and utilize the teacher model to guide the student model to learn consensus features that contain as much multi-view information as possible.

Ring building is a crucial task involving the assembly of concrete segments into a tunnel ring using an erector unit to reinforce the freshly bored tunnel surface. The erector unit is a human-controlled robot with six degrees of freedom movement used to grab and place the individual tunnel segments. The experience of the erector operator is hence decisive for an efficient ring building process, which can be optimized with the assistance of intelligent control systems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a learning approach that provided many control policies for robotic applications. Currently, no simulation environment is publicly available to train and test RL agents on erector units in tunnel ring building. This research aims to address this gap by designing an Experimental Digital Twin (EDT) for the erector unit in ring building. We created our EDT using the simulation tool MuJoCo and Proximal Policy Optimization as RL method. Our findings reveal that the RL agent learned to successfully build tunnel rings with a control policy that can be further optimized for fine adjustments in segment placing, especially the last ring segment. Our future work consists of investigating the RL agent robustness and studying transfer potential to real-world applications under safety constraints. Our EDT is a first step towards learning control policies that optimally execute segment lining, thus helping human operators build tunnel rings efficiently in a challenging work environment prone to accidents and decreasing interest from future talents.","","978-1-6654-6397-3","10.1109/EUROCON56442.2023.10198935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10198935","Experimental Digital Twins;Reinforcement Learning;Intelligent Control Systems;Tunnel Boring Machines","Buildings;Process control;Robustness;Safety;Digital twins;Task analysis;Collision avoidance","","","","16","IEEE","7 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A major drawback of numerical solvers, especially within the context of FWI, is that they are still computationally expensive requiring often unattainable computational resources and access to high-performance computing (HPC). In this work, we present a near real-time deep-learning forward solver for GPR data that can generate entire B-scans, given certain model parameters as inputs. The machine-learning (ML) model is tuned for reinforced concrete slab scenarios, but the same rationale can be applied in a straightforward manner to other applications as well. The training was performed using entirely synthetic data, where a 3-D digital twin based on the 2000-MHz “palm” antenna from Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc. (GSSI) was included in FDTD simulations for the training set. The accuracy of the deep-learning solver is demonstrated with both synthetic and real data from reinforced concrete slabs. The predicted ML responses were in very good agreement with FDTD, showing a high degree of accuracy. The ML solver is then used as part of an FWI algorithm to characterize the concrete slab and estimate the depth and radius of the buried rebars. Coupled FWI with an ML-based forward solver results in significantly less execution times compared to conventional FWI using numerical solvers. The high accuracy of the proposed FWI, combined with the efficiency and speed of the ML-based forward solver, make the proposed scheme an ideal tool for characterizing concrete structures in nondestructive testing.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3303683","University of Edinburgh; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214072","Concrete;deep learning;finite-difference time-domain (FDTD);forward problem;full-waveform inversion (FWI);ground penetrating radar (GPR);machine learning (ML);neural networks (NNs)","Finite difference methods;Time-domain analysis;Concrete;Antennas;Training;Slabs;Deep learning","","1","","48","IEEE","9 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, many neural networks will strengthen the segmentation ability of the model by artificially adding noise. However, because the noise distribution of the input data is not known, the model training process can only generate random noise, e.g., gaussian noise, but cannot simulate real-world noise. In the medical imaging domain, more attention is paid to the image contours, which can also be used for noising simulation. Meanwhile, considering the existence of rich unlabeled data sets in medical images, this paper proposes a semi-supervised framework for uncertainty estimation by using Monte Carlo Dropout and generates adaptive noise using the uncertainty map. Specifically, the framework consists of three parts, including a noise generation model, a teacher model, and a student model. The noise generation part processes the data input to the other two parts and uses the contour feature identified by the posteriori uncertainty map to simulate priori noise to guide the process of training segmentation model. Meanwhile, the student model updates its parameters based on the teacher model output and the ground truth annotations by minimizing a joint loss. Segmentation experiments on left atrium 3D data show that our method has competitive results with other SOTA semi-supervised methods.","2769-3554","978-1-6654-9125-9","10.1109/ICAIBD57115.2023.10206261","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10206261","semi-supervised learning;uncertainty estimation;contour noise generation;medical image segmentation","Training;Image segmentation;Adaptation models;Uncertainty;Adaptive systems;Three-dimensional displays;Estimation","","","","19","IEEE","10 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the creation of digital twins requires the processing of an enormous amount of data, thereby leading to an increase in mobile network traffic. This traffic is produced by applications in user devices and city services, which engage in local consumption at the city scale through sensor and camera devices using mobile networks. Such increased traffic can compromise the communication speed and stability. To alleviate this burden, traffic offloading becomes a crucial consideration in the beyond-5G era. This paper presents a scheme known as Area-Controlled Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking (AMoND). AMoND uses a hierarchical structure of a location layer and an ad-hoc layer to construct area-controlled mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) for mutual support of the digital twin and MANETs. AMoND effectively suppresses mobile network traffic by harnessing the digital twin to assist the MANETs during data collection for the digital twin construction. Importantly, the digital twin used in AMoND focuses on the management of node location information and does not need to reproduce the real space on a computer fully. AMoND is not dependent on a specific MANET protocol and can be used as an add-on. AMoND exhibits the ability to reduce traffic volumes by up to approximately 65%, while maintaining arrival rates that are comparable to existing MANET protocols under certain conditions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3304374","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP21H04886,JP21K17734); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10214544","MANETs;location information;traffic load;digital twin;machine learning","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Digital twins;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless communication;Machine learning;Internet of Things","","","","47","CCBYNCND","11 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Some recent studies have found that simply relying on reducing parameters or reducing the theoretical FLOPs of the model does not speed up the inference time of the network in a practical sense. Actual speed on the device is probably a better measure than FLOPs. In this work, we propose a new single residual network (SRN). On the one hand, we try to introduce and optimize an attention mechanism module to improve the performance of the network with a relatively small speed loss. On the other hand, we find that residuals in residual blocks do not have a positive impact on networks with adjusted ESA. Therefore, the residual of the network residual block is removed, which not only improves the speed of the network, but also improves the performance of the network. Finally, we reduced the number of channels and the number of residual blocks of the classic model EDSR, and removed the last convolution before the long residual. We set this tuned EDSR as the teacher model and our newly proposed SRN as the student model. Under the joint effect of the original loss and the distillation loss, the performance of the network can be improved without losing the inference time. Combining the above strategies, our proposed model runs much faster than similarly performing models. As an example, we built a Fast and Efficient Network (SRN) and its small version SRN-S, which run 30%-37% faster than the state-of-the-art EISR model: a paper champion RLFN. Furthermore, the shallow version of SRN-S achieves the second-shortest inference time as well as the second-smallest number of activations in the NTIRE2023 challenge.

This extreme concept might lead to the ruin of typical processes for delivery services, such as face-to-face authentication, item checking, and payment in person. So, it may cause insufficiency regarding both sides of the secure item delivery and customers’ personal security. Therefore, this paper comes up with a novel CONTACTFUL delivery service with the digital twin paradigm to resolve contactless problems.

IGSD involves a teacher-student distillation process that uses graph diffusion augmentations and constructs the teacher model using an exponential moving average of the student model. The intuition behind IGSD is to predict the teacher network representation of the graph pairs under different augmented views. As a natural extension, we also apply IGSD to semi-supervised scenarios by jointly regularizing the network with both supervised and self-supervised contrastive loss.

Finally, numerical results are given to validate the performance gain of the proposed scheme, in comparison with the fixed accuracy scheme, the non-spread spectrum scheme and the time division multiple access transmission scheme.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3305711","Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program(grant numbers:XLYC2002078); FDCT(grant numbers:0158/2022/A); Intergovernmental International Cooperation in Science and Technology Innovation Program(grant numbers:2019YFE0111600); National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants(grant numbers:61971083,62071431,62072490,62122069,62201507); FDCT-MOST(grant numbers:0066/2019/AMJ); MYRG(grant numbers:2020-00107-IOTSC); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:2022A1515011287); Major Key Project of PCL(grant numbers:PCL2021A03-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10220230","Digital twin;federated learning;energy minimization;non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA);secrecy provisioning;joint optimization","Digital twins;Computational modeling;Security;Resource management;Quality of service;NOMA;Internet of Things","","1","","","IEEE","16 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We for the first time combine both of their advantages and propose an Adversarial Mean Teacher (AMT) framework. On the one hand, we optimize the student model with domain adversarial learning. On the other hand, we feed perturbed target images to the teacher model to generate pseudo-labels. Furthermore, to improve the quality of the pseudo-labels, we propose an Adaptive Teaching (AT) module, consisting of pseudo-label refinement and credible pseudo-label selection. Concretely, we first generate two candidate pseudo-labels from the prediction of the teacher model and obtain a refined pseudo-label by mixing them at the pixel-level. Moreover, we introduce an auxiliary task of foreground-background classification to assist credible region selection and only activate supervision signals on those regions.

However, security practitioners still do not know what type of vulnerabilities correspond to a given prediction (aka CWE-ID). Thus, a novel approach to explain the type of vulnerabilities for a given prediction is imperative. In this paper, we propose VulExplainer, an approach to explain the type of vulnerabilities. We represent VulExplainer as a vulnerability classification task. However, vulnerabilities have diverse characteristics (i.e., CWE-IDs) and the number of labeled samples in each CWE-ID is highly imbalanced (known as a highly imbalanced multi-class classification problem), which often lead to inaccurate predictions. Thus, we introduce a Transformer-based hierarchical distillation for software vulnerability classification in order to address the highly imbalanced types of software vulnerabilities. Specifically, we split a complex label distribution into sub-distributions based on CWE abstract types (i.e., categorizations that group similar CWE-IDs). Thus, similar CWE-IDs can be grouped and each group will have a more balanced label distribution. We learn TextCNN teachers on each of the simplified distributions respectively, however, they only perform well in their group. Thus, we build a transformer student model to generalize the performance of TextCNN teachers through our hierarchical knowledge distillation framework. Through an extensive evaluation using the real-world 8,636 vulnerabilities, our approach outperforms all of the baselines by 5%–29%. The results also demonstrate that our approach can be applied to Transformer-based architectures such as CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, and CodeGPT. Moreover, our method maintains compatibility with any Transformer-based model without requiring any architectural modifications but only adds a special distillation token to the input. These results highlight our significant contributions towards the fundamental and practical problem of explaining software vulnerability.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2023.3305244","ARC(grant numbers:DE200100941); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10220166","Software vulnerability;software security","Software;Transformers;Security;Static VAr compensators;Data models;Codes;Task analysis","","","","82","IEEE","16 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key issue is to motivate both ESP and UAVs to participate in the energy trading market. To doing so, we design an incentive mechanism that maximizes the revenue of the ESP while guaranteeing desired economic properties, i.e. individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC). In particular, we first consider a single energy unit market, where a deep learning (DL)-based auction scheme is developed to construct neural networks from the analytical results of Myerson auction. The proposed DL-based auction is guaranteed to fulfill the optimal auction. We then consider a general scenario in which ESP has multiple energy units available to UAVs. A novel DL-based auction with feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) is proposed to jointly optimize the energy unit allocation and payment rules. We provide numerical results to demonstrate the performance improvement of the DL-based auction schemes compared to the classical auctions in terms of revenue, IC and IR.

In this paper, we introduce a new deep-learning diagnosis framework, called InterNRL, that is designed to be highly accurate and interpretable. InterNRL consists of a student-teacher framework, where the student model is an interpretable prototype-based classifier (ProtoPNet) and the teacher is an accurate global image classifier (GlobalNet). The two classifiers are mutually optimised with a novel reciprocal learning paradigm in which the student ProtoPNet learns from optimal pseudo labels produced by the teacher GlobalNet, while GlobalNet learns from ProtoPNet’s classification performance and pseudo labels. This reciprocal learning paradigm enables InterNRL to be flexibly optimised under both fully- and semi-supervised learning scenarios, reaching state-of-the-art classification performance in both scenarios for the tasks of breast cancer and retinal disease diagnosis. Moreover, relying on weakly-labelled training images, InterNRL also achieves superior breast cancer localisation and brain tumour segmentation results than other competing methods.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2023.3306781","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:FT190100525); Medical Research Future Fund - Grant MRFAI000090 for the Transforming Breast Cancer Screening with Artificial Intelligence (BRAIx) Project(grant numbers:MRFAI000090); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10225391","Interpretability;Interpretable Classification;Reciprocal Learning;Student-teacher Model;Semi-supervised learning;Weakly-supervised Segmentation;Mammogram;Optical Coherence Tomography","Training;Prototypes;Predictive models;Retina;Mammography;Deep learning;Task analysis","","","","","IEEE","21 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, due to great cross-user variability, it suffers from severe performance degradation when it is trained on one set of user data and then tested with new user data. To improve its cross-user usability, a dual-step domain adaptation network (DSDAN) is proposed to fully exploit useful information in the training data (source domain) and efficiently deliver it to the testing data from a new user (target domain). The DSDAN is based on bidirectional knowledge distillation (KD) and uses a teacher–student model to implement the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which allows the classification model to adapt to a new user in the testing phase without any labeled data. A bidirectional KD technique was adopted to facilitate mutual learning between the teacher and student networks to address the problem of balancing adaptation speed and accuracy in the UDA. A novel dual-step domain adaptation (DSDA) strategy was utilized to mitigate knowledge obsolescence and error accumulation problems in KD. We evaluated the performance of the DSDAN framework on both high- and low-density sEMG datasets and achieved 98.96 ± 4.91% and 98.09 ± 1.86% recognition accuracies, respectively, which are better than those of mainstream UDA methods ( ${p}< {0.01}$ ).

APTs defense requires fusing multi-dimensional Cyber threat intelligence data to identify attack intentions and conducts efficient knowledge discovery strategies by data-driven machine learning to recognize entity relationships. However, data-driven machine learning lacks generalization ability on fresh or unknown samples, reducing the accuracy and practicality of the defense model. Besides, the private deployment of these APT defense models on heterogeneous environments and various network devices requires significant investment in context awareness (such as known attack entities, continuous network states, and current security strategies). In this paper, we propose a few-shot multi-domain knowledge rearming (FMKR) scheme for context-aware defense against APTs. By completing multiple small tasks that are generated from different network domains with meta-learning, the FMKR firstly trains a model with good discrimination and generalization ability for fresh and unknown APT attacks. In each FMKR task, both threat intelligence and local entities are fused into the support/query sets in meta-learning to identify possible attack stages. Secondly, to rearm current security strategies, an finetuning-based deployment mechanism is proposed to transfer learned knowledge into the student model, while minimizing the defense cost. Compared to multiple model replacement strategies, the FMKR provides a faster response to attack behaviors while consuming less scheduling cost. Based on the feedback from multiple real users of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) over 2 months, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can improve the defense satisfaction rate.","","979-8-3503-0252-3","10.1109/SmartNets58706.2023.10216058","Nature; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10216058","Advanced persistent threats (APTs);Contextaware defense;Few-shot knowledge rearming;Meta-learning;Threat intelligence;Industrial internet of things","Metalearning;Costs;Job shop scheduling;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Knowledge discovery;Behavioral sciences","","1","","30","IEEE","22 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the impressive performance of stereo-based 3D object detection is at the huge cost of high-quality manual annotations, which are hardly attainable for any given scene. Semi-supervised learning, in which limited annotated data and numerous unannotated data are required to achieve a satisfactory model, is a promising method to address the problem of data deficiency. In this work, we propose to achieve semi-supervised learning for stereo-based 3D object detection through pseudo annotation generation from a temporal-aggregated teacher model, which temporally accumulates knowledge from a student model. To facilitate a more stable and accurate depth estimation, we introduce Temporal-Aggregation-Guided (TAG) disparity consistency, a cross-view disparity consistency constraint between the teacher model and the student model for robust and improved depth estimation. To mitigate noise in pseudo annotation generation, we propose a cross-view agreement strategy, in which pseudo annotations should attain high degree of agreements between 3D and 2D views, as well as between binocular views. We perform extensive experiments on the KITTI 3D dataset to demonstrate our proposed method's capability in leveraging a huge amount of unannotated stereo images to attain significantly improved detection results.","2575-7075","979-8-3503-0129-8","10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01676","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region(grant numbers:CityU 11206622); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072189); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10203709","3D from multi-view and sensors","Training;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Annotations;Estimation;Object detection;Semisupervised learning","","","","51","IEEE","22 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We start from a key perspective that fixed relative locationsand variable sizes of different organs can provide distribution information where a multi-organ CT scan is drawn. Thus, we treat the prior anatomy as a strong tool to guide the data augmentation and reduce the mismatch between labeled and unlabeled images for semi-supervised learning. More specifically, we propose a data augmentation strategy based on partition-and-recovery N3 cubes cross-and within-labeled and unlabeled images. Our strategy encourages unlabeled images to learn organ semantics in relative locations from the labeled images (cross-branch) and enhances the learning ability for small organs (within-branch). For within-branch, we further propose to refine the quality of pseudo labels by blending the learned representations from small cubes to incorporate local attributes. Our method is termed as MagicNet, since it treats the CT volume as a magic-cube and N3-cube partition-and-recovery process matches with the rule of playing a magic-cube.

We develop a novel distillation scheme that can address these limitations and close the gap between the sensorimotor agent and its privileged teacher. Our key insight is to design a student which learns to align their input features with the teacher's privileged Bird's Eye View (BEV) space. The student then can benefit from direct supervision by the teacher over the internal representation learning. To scaffold the difficult sensorimotor learning task, the student model is optimized via a student-paced coaching mechanism with various auxiliary supervision. We further propose a high-capacity imitation learned privileged agent that surpasses prior privileged agents in CARLA and ensures the student learns safe driving behavior. Our proposed sensorimotor agent results in a robust image-based behavior cloning agent in CARLA, improving over current models by over 20.6% in driving score without requiring LiDAR, historical observations, ensemble of models, on-policy data aggregation or reinforcement learning.","2575-7075","979-8-3503-0129-8","10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.00754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10203984","Autonomous driving","Representation learning;Training;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Reinforcement learning;Data models;Behavioral sciences","","","","85","IEEE","22 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these attempts may fail in dynamic scenarios of real-world applications like autonomous driving, where the environments gradually change and the test data is sampled correlatively over time. In this work, we explore such practical test data streams to deploy the model on the fly, namely practical test-time adaptation (PTTA). To do so, we elaborate a Robust Test-Time Adaptation (RoTTA) method against the complex data stream in PTTA.

Meanwhile, a memory bank is utilized to sample category-balanced data with consideration of timeliness and uncertainty. Further, to stabilize the training procedure, we develop a time-aware reweighting strategy with a teacher-student model.

This generalization brings up two practical benefits that existing methods could not provide: (1) the uncertainty of a face image can be evaluated and further decomposed into aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty, the latter of which can be used as a measure for out-of-distribution detection of faceness; (2) a BEA statistic provably reflects the aleatoric uncertainty of a face image, acting as a measure for face image quality to improve recognition performance.

By reconstructing masked image patches from a small portion of visible image regions, MAE forces the model to infer semantic correlation within an image. Recently, some approaches apply semantic-rich teacher models to extract image features as the reconstruction target, leading to better performance. However, unlike the low-level features such as pixel values, we argue the features extracted by powerful teacher models already encode rich semantic correlation across regions in an intact image. This raises one question: is reconstruction necessary in Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with a teacher model? In this paper, we propose an efficient MIM paradigm named MaskAlign. MaskAlign simply learns the consistency of visible patch features extracted by the student model and intact image features extracted by the teacher model. To further advance the performance and tackle the problem of input inconsistency between the student and teacher model, we propose a Dynamic Alignment (DA) module to apply learnable alignment. Our experimental results demonstrate that masked modeling does not lose effectiveness even without reconstruction on masked regions.

The main limitations of the existing device model lie in (1) unable to update due to the computation limit of the device, (2) the limited generalization ability of the lightweight model. Meanwhile, recent large models have shown strong generalization capability on the cloud while they can not be deployed on client devices due to poor computation constraints. To enable the device model to deal with changing environments, we propose a new learning paradigm of Cloud-Device Collaborative Continual Adaptation, which encourages collaboration between cloud and device and improves the generalization of the device model. Based on this paradigm, we further propose an Uncertainty-based Visual Prompt Adapted (U-VPA) teacher-student model to transfer the generalization capability of the large model on the cloud to the device model. Specifically, we first design the Uncertainty Guided Sampling (UGS) to screen out challenging data continuously and transmit the most out-of-distribution samples from the device to the cloud. Then we propose a Visual Prompt Learning Strategy with Uncertainty guided updating (VPLU) to specifically deal with the selected samples with more distribution shifts. We transmit the visual prompts to the device and concatenate them with the incoming data to pull the device testing distribution closer to the cloud training distribution.

Most existing TTA approaches assume the setting in which the target domain is stationary, i.e., all the test inputs come from a single target domain. However, in many practical settings, the test input distribution might exhibit a lifelong/continual shift over time. Moreover, existing TTA approaches also lack the ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates, which is crucial when distribution shifts occur between the source and target domain. To address these issues, we present PETAL (Probabilistic lifElong Test-time Adaptation with self-training prior), which solves lifelong TTA using a probabilistic approach, and naturally results in (1) a student-teacher framework, where the teacher model is an exponential moving average of the student model, and (2) regularizing the model updates at inference time using the source model as a regularizer. To prevent model drift in the lifelong/continual TTA setting, we also propose a data-driven parameter restoration technique which contributes to reducing the error accumulation and maintaining the knowledge of recent domains by restoring only the irrelevant parameters. In terms of predictive error rate as well as uncertainty based metrics such as Brier score and negative log-likelihood, our method achieves better results than the current state-of-the-art for online lifelong test-time adaptation across various benchmarks, such as CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNetC, and ImageNet3DCC datasets.

To prevent such a weak solution, we introduce an additional objective term, i.e., the mutual information between the teacher and the auxiliary modality model. Besides, to narrow down the information gap between the student and teacher, we further propose to minimize the conditional entropy of the teacher given the student. Novel training schemes based on contrastive learning and adversarial learning are designed to optimize the mutual information and the conditional entropy, respectively.

However, the lightweight stu-dent model lacks adequate representation capacity for effective knowledge imitation during the most critical early training period, causing final performance degeneration. To tackle this issue, we propose a Capacity Dynamic Distillation framework, which constructs a student model with editable representation capacity. Specifically, the employed student model is initially a heavy model to fruitfully learn distilled knowledge in the early training epochs, and the stu-dent model is gradually compressed during the training. To dynamically adjust the model capacity, our dynamic frame-work inserts a learnable convolutional layer within each residual block in the student model as the channel importance indicator.

However, most existing distillation approaches focus on the types of knowledge and how to distil them, which neglect the student model's neuronal responses to the knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that the kullback-leibler loss inhibits the neuronal responses in the opposite gradient direction, which injures the student model's potential during distilling. To address this problem, we introduce a principled dual-stage distillation scheme to rejuvenate all inhibited neurons at the neuronal level. In the first stage, we detect all the neurons in the student model during the standard distillation period and divide them into two parts according to their responses. In the second stage, we propose three strategies to resuscitate the neurons differently, which allows us to exploit the full potential of the student model. Through the experiments in various aspects of knowledge distillation, it is verified that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches. Our work provides a neuronal perspective for studying the response of the student model to the knowledge from the teacher model.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2023.3306601","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172166,61772366,U1811263); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:2022A1515011380); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10227559","Knowledge distillation;transfer learning;model regularization;deep learning","Neurons;Computational modeling;Standards;Optimization;Knowledge engineering;Task analysis;Probabilistic logic","","","","","IEEE","23 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, the increasing system complexity also makes them more vulnerable to cyber-physical threats. Coordinated cyber attacks (CCAs) have emerged as a major concern, requiring effective detection and mitigation strategies within V2G-CPSs. Digital twin (DT) technologies have shown promise in mitigating system complexity and providing diverse functionalities for complex tasks such as system monitoring, analysis, and optimal control. This paper presents a resilient and secure framework for CCA detection and mitigation in V2G-CPSs, leveraging a smart DT-enabled approach. The framework introduces a smarter DT orchestrator that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) based actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (LSTM-DRL) in the DT virtual replica. The LSTM algorithm estimates the system states, which are then used by the DRL network to detect CCAs and take appropriate actions to minimize their impact. To validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed smart DT framework, case studies are conducted on an IEEE 30 bus system-based V2G-CPS, considering different CCA types such as malicious V2G node or control command attacks. The results demonstrate that the framework is capable of accurately estimating system states, detecting various CCAs, and mitigating the impact of attacks within 5 seconds.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2023.3305916","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-2128448,ECCS-2335876); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10220152","Coordinated cyber attacks;digital twin;cyber-physical systems;long short term memory;deep reinforcement learning","Vehicle-to-grid;Cyberattack;Contingency management;Reliability;Complexity theory;Security;Phasor measurement units","","","","48","IEEE","23 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this way, the student model is forced to be distinguishable at different time-steps, so that the teacher model can acquire more diverse task-related information and produce higher-accuracy pseudo labels.

However, existing MT-based SSLs still give rise to two main concerns: (1) limited learning ability of student network that neglects the union of local feature and global cues extraction which may impact the representation learning of variable objects. (2) limited knowledge-transferring ability of teacher network with only pixel-level consistency regularization that may result in inadequate and unstable guidance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning scheme, namely MedFCT, with two appealing designs: (1) A dual student architecture with parallel CNN and Transformer branches is designed for local-global feature extraction, where the full-frequency interaction between CNN and Transformer can be explored by a frequency domain cross-fusion (FDCF) module to learn complementarity of the two-paradigm features.

Moreover, the attention mechanism has been introduced recently to enable each layer of the student to learn knowledge from all teacher layers, which brings about considerable optimization. However, noted that features from different layers, such as shallow and deep layers, might have a big semantic gap, and compulsively aligning one student layer to all teacher layers would mislead the learning process. To tackle this problem, an effective framework called Semantic Stage-Wise learning for Knowledge Distillation (SSWKD) is presented in this paper. We divide all layers into shallow and deep stages, and only allow feature alignment within the same stage to alleviate semantic mismatch. In addition, with the observation that the performance of deep networks relies more on some key features rather than evenly on all of them, a crucial feature enhancement method based on KL divergence is then proposed for SSWKD, forcing the student to pay more attention to critical features of the teacher. Extensive experiments and visualizations show that our SSWKD outperforms other distillation methods on CIFAR-100 and COCO2017 datasets for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks.","1945-788X","978-1-6654-6891-6","10.1109/ICME55011.2023.00145","Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10219880","knowledge distillation;image classification;object detection;instance segmentation","Image segmentation;Visualization;Semantics;Object detection;Task analysis;Optimization;Image classification","","","","33","IEEE","25 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simulation results confirm that the proposed DT-enabled resource allocation scheme for the RIS-empowered MEC network achieves up to 60% lower transmission delay and 20% lower energy consumption compared to without RIS scheme.","2833-0587","978-1-6654-9427-4","10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS57453.2023.10226132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10226132","Deep reinforcement learning;reconfigurable intelligent surface;mobile edge computing;digital twin;ultra-reliability;low-latency communication","Energy consumption;Array signal processing;Simulation;Computer architecture;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Minimization;Delays","","","","23","IEEE","29 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The demand for Metaverse applications and hence, real-time digital twinning of real-world scenes is increasing. Nevertheless, the replication of 2D physical world images into 3D virtual world scenes is computationally intensive and requires computation offloading. The disparity in transmitted scene dimension (2D as opposed to 3D) leads to asymmetric data sizes in uplink (UL) and downlink (DL). To ensure the reliability and low latency of the system, we consider an asynchronous joint UL-DL scenario where the smaller data size of the physical world scenes captured in the UL will be uploaded to the Metaverse Console (MC) to be construed and rendered, and the larger-size 3D virtual world scenes need to be transmitted back in DL. The decisions pertaining to computation offloading and channel assignment are optimized in the UL stage, and the MC will optimize power allocation for users assigned with a channel in the UL transmission stage. To ensure the reliability and low latency of the system, we design a novel Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) structure, namely Asynchronous Actors Hybrid Critic (AAHC).

Recent studies have shown that knowledge distillation approaches can effectively transfer knowledge from a high-resolution teacher model to a low-resolution student model by aligning cross-resolution representations.

In this study, we propose a cross-resolution relational contrastive distillation approach to facilitate low-resolution object recognition. Our approach enables the student model to mimic the behavior of a well-trained teacher model which delivers high accuracy in identifying high-resolution objects. To extract sufficient knowledge, the student learning is supervised with contrastive relational distillation loss, which preserves the similarities in various relational structures in contrastive representation space. In this manner, the capability of recovering missing details of familiar low-resolution objects can be effectively enhanced, leading to a better knowledge transfer.

The dominant approaches are based on the full-supervised learning paradigm that requires a large number of labeled samples to train their models, which is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. To alleviate this problem, this study proposes a semisupervised building instance extraction method that integrates teacher–student learning and pseudo-labeling to improve the building instance extraction from HR RSI. Specifically, the proposed method consists of three modules, the hybrid data augmentation (HDA) module, the pseudo-label generation (PLG) module, and the contour refinement (CR) module. The HDA module is designed to enrich the diversity of labeled samples to optimize the teacher model. The PLG module generates pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to train a student model with pseudo-labels. Finally, the CR module is designed to refine the contours of buildings. Experimental results on three challenging public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance and exhibits great robustness at different proportions of labeled data and different building scenarios.

Meanwhile, mobile network is moving towards data-driven paradigm, the issue of data privacy and data security seem to be a bottleneck. As a result, federated learning (FL) and mobile network are deeply converging. However, the mobile network is time-varying and the parameters of FL-empowered mobile network is huge and continue to increase with exponential growth of wireless terminals, result in the failure of traditional modeling. In the mobile networks, DT is conducive to prototyping, testing, and optimization, enabling mobile networks to be modelled more efficiently in a virtual environment and thus providing guidance for practical application. To this end, a communication-assisted sensing scenario is considered in this paper with FL in DT-empowered mobile networks. More specifically, two communication-assisted sensing architectures are proposed to improve communication efficiency of mobile network, namely, centralized architecture of federated transfer learning (FTL) and decentralized architecture of FTL. For centralized architecture of FTL, feature extraction of sensing information is conducted by FL between partial nodes and central server while the remaining nodes are used to train the fully connected layers at the central server. Considering data safety during the communication between sensing nodes, a decentralized architecture is designed based on FTL and Blockchain, where the feature extraction module is obtained by the fusion of sharing model (by Blockchain) and local model.

In order to protect data privacy, Federated Learning (FL) has been suggested as a solution, involving the sharing of model parameters rather than data itself. Current FL applications, however, still struggle with cost efficiency, especially when IIoT devices with heterogenous resources are involved. To address this, this paper proposes Digital Twin (DT) enabled Asynchronous SplitFed Learning (DT-ASFL) for classification tasks in the e-healthcare system over mobile networks. We first develop SplitFed Learning to introduce communication efficiency in the e-healthcare system, sending only extracted features during the learning process instead of the entire learning model. This enables resource-constrained devices to participate in the learning process by allowing the participants to train a partial learning model. DT is then employed to provide real-time statuses of IIoT devices deployed in the system, enabling asynchronous model updates in SplitFed Learning.

Digital Twin-based VEC is emerging as a promising solution that enables real-time monitoring of the state of the VEC network through mapping and interaction between the physical and virtual worlds, thus assisting in making sound offload decisions in the physical world. Thus, this paper proposes an intelligent partial offloading scheme, namely, Digital Twin-Assisted Intelligent Partial Offloading (IGNITE). First, to find the optimal offloading space in advance, we combine the improved clustering algorithm with the Digital Twin (DT) technique, in which unreasonable decisions can be avoided by reducing the size of the decision space. Second, to reduce the overall cost of the system, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is employed to train the offloading strategy, allowing for automatic optimization of computational delay and vehicle service price. To improve the efficiency of cooperation between digital and physical spaces, a feedback mechanism is established. It can adjust the parameters of the clustering algorithm based on the final offloading results in this clustering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on DT-assisted vehicle offloading that proposes a feedback mechanism, forming a complete closed loop as prediction-offloading-feedback.

Specifically, we propose a novel learning framework that maximizes the sum-rate by jointly optimizing the access point and user association (AUA), power control, and RIS beamforming. This problem is challenging and has never been addressed due to its prohibitively large and complex solution space. Our framework decouples the AUA from the power control and RIS beamforming (PCRB) based on the different natures of their variables, hence reducing the solution space. A new position-adaptive binary particle swarm optimization (PABPSO) method is designed for the AUA. Two twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) models with new and refined state pre-processing layers are developed for the PCRB. Another important aspect is that a DT is leveraged to train the learning framework with its replay of channel estimates stored.

Notably, DT platforms provide a sandbox in which to test artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for communication systems, potentially reducing the need to collect data and test algorithms in the field, i.e., on the physical twin (PT). A key challenge in the deployment of DT systems is to ensure that virtual control optimization, monitoring, and analysis at the DT are safe and reliable, avoiding incorrect decisions caused by “model exploitation”. To address this challenge, this paper presents a general Bayesian framework with the aim of quantifying and accounting for model uncertainty at the DT that is caused by limitations in the amount and quality of data available at the DT from the PT. In the proposed framework, the DT builds a Bayesian model of the communication system, which is leveraged to enable core DT functionalities such as control via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), monitoring of the PT for anomaly detection, prediction, data-collection optimization, and counterfactual analysis. To exemplify the application of the proposed framework, we specifically investigate a case-study system encompassing multiple sensing devices that report to a common receiver.

However, the vision-based methods face the problem of privacy breach, whereas the wearable-based methods may bring inconvenience to users. With the wide deployment of Wi-Fi networks, lots of consumer devices are widely accessible in people’s homes. Motivated by the fact that Wi-Fi signal propagation can be affected by human motion, the opportunity to use Wi-Fi signals for gesture recognition can be further explored. However, the challenge is that the received Wi-Fi signal shows great differences when the same person performs the same gesture in different environments or different person performs the same gesture in the same environment. Therefore, the signal alignment across different domain needs to be solved. In this paper, we propose a gesture recognition system named Phase-Attention-based-Conv-CSI (PAC-CSI), which consists of two modules: data processing and gesture recognition. In the data processing module, we eliminate random phase noise in channel state information (CSI) and perform phase calibration. In the gesture recognition module, we feed the processed phase sequence into a lightweight deep neural network for gesture recognition. PAC-CSI can obtain the gesture category in about 200ms, which can meets the real-time requirements of DT.

The IoV network provides ubiquitous connections even in areas uncovered by RSUs with the assistance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which can act as a relay between RSUs and task vehicles. A virtual representation of the IoV network is established in the aerial network as DT which captures the dynamics of the entities of the physical network in real-time in order to perform efficient resource allocation for delay-intolerant tasks. We investigate an intelligent delay-sensitive task offloading scheme for the dynamic vehicular environment which provides computation resources via local execution, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and vehicle-to-roadside-unit (V2I) offloading modes based on the energy consumption of the system. Moreover, we also propose a multi-network deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation algorithm (RADiT) in the DT-assisted network for maximizing the utility of the IoV network while optimizing the task offloading strategy. Further, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with and without the presence of V2V computation mode. RADiT is further evaluated by comparing it with another benchmark DRL algorithm called soft actor-critic (SAC) and a non-DRL approach called greedy. Finally, simulations are performed to demonstrate that the utility of the proposed RADiT algorithm is higher under every condition compared to its respective conditions in SAC and greedy approach.

Definitive intelligent IoT attack identification enables intelligent algorithms to extract attack features for application scenarios with fixed topological environments but cannot construct the intricate changes of IoT application scenarios. Through the dynamic acquisition, feature awareness, and deep learning, intelligent digital twin-based attack detection can address these issues and enhance attack identification for IoT threats. Thus, this paper proposed an intelligent digital twin method based on spatio-temporal feature fusion for IoT attack behavior identification. Firstly, feature subsets are selected based on information gain to reduce the dimensionality of IoT data with high traffic; Secondly, a parallel spatio-temporal feature extraction model is designed unlike the existing tandem model, which uses a simplified Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model to learn the spatial features of the attack, a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model to learn the temporal features of the attack, an attention mechanism to fuse the temporal and spatial features, and the (Deep Neural Networks) DNN to learn the combined features; Finally, the virtual instance space and topology of the attack scenario are simulated using digital twin (DT) to build a digital version of the complex system for IoT applications and tested in a simulation environment.

The disadvantage of this method is that it cannot effectively capture the long-distance dependencies in the image, and it does not have the ability of dynamic adaptive modeling. Next, the high-quality labeled data of chest X-ray images are very scarce. In order to achieve high-quality artificial intelligence diagnosis, a large number of high-quality annotated chest X-ray images are required.

This paper proposes a DT-driven edge-end collaborative scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous tasks and heterogeneous computing/communication resources. Specifically, multiple end devices (EDs) cooperate with each other to accomplish a complex job, where each ED can offload individual task to multiple edge servers (ESs) for parallel computing. By fully considering deadline requirements of heterogeneous tasks, maximum computing capabilities of ESs and EDs, computing resource estimation deviations of DT, maximum transmit powers of EDs and tolerable peak interference powers to coexisting EDs, we formulate a job completion time minimization problem to jointly optimize the edge-end task division, transmit power control, computing resource type matching and allocation. To solve this non-convex problem, we first reformulate it by multi-agent Markov decision process, where a compound reward leveraging latency reward and deadline reward according to the task criticality is designed. Then, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based scheduling algorithm, where Actor-Critic framework with estimation and target networks is designed for policy and value iterations. Meanwhile, a step-by-step  $\epsilon $ -greedy algorithm is proposed to balance exploration and exploitation, avoiding local optimal trap. Through offline centralized training by DT and online distributed execution by EDs, we realize edge-end collaborative computing for heterogeneous tasks.

Systematic resource management is central in maintaining optimal Quality of Service (QoS) in cloud platforms and is divided into three fundamental types: resource provisioning, AI model deployment and workload placement. To exploit the synergy among these decision types, it becomes imperative to concurrently design (co-design) the provisioning, deployment and placement decisions for optimal QoS. As users and cloud service providers shift to non-stationary AI-based workloads, frequent decision making imposes severe time constraints on the resource management models. Existing AI-based solutions often optimize decision types independently and tend to ignore the dependencies across various system performance aspects such as energy consumption and CPU utilization, making them perform poorly in large-scale cloud systems. To address this, we propose a novel method, called SciNet, that leverages a co-simulated digital-twin of the infrastructure to capture inter-metric dependencies and accurately estimate QoS scores. To avoid expensive simulation overheads at test time, SciNet trains a neural network based imitation learner that aims to mimic an oracle, which takes optimal decisions based on co-simulated QoS estimates. Offline model training and online decision making based on the imitation learner, enables SciNet to take optimal decisions while being time-efficient. Experiments with real-life AI-based benchmark applications on a public cloud testbed show that SciNet gives up to 48% lower execution cost, 79% higher inference accuracy, 71% lower energy consumption and 56% lower response times compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2023.3310678","Imperial College London; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10236903","Concurrent design;cloud computing;resource management;provisioning;deployment;scheduling;imitation learning;deep learning","Cloud computing;Optimization;Quality of service;Computational modeling;Artificial intelligence;Resource management;Costs","","","","46","IEEE","31 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the limitation of storage, computation, and radio resources, the dynamics of the decentralized MEC environment, and the complex spatial relationships of service request types and wireless network states between edge nodes make it difficult to realize efficient edge computing services. To address these challenges, this paper integrates the digital twin (DT) technology with a multi-cell MEC network to study an intelligent cooperative task offloading and service caching scheme, aiming at maximizing a quality of services (QoE)-based system utility. Specifically, we first construct a digital twin edge network (DITEN) to reflect the physical MEC system in real-time and provide data for training. With the help of DT technology, it is easy to access data resources in the DITEN to improve the simulation ability and reduce the communication cost. Then, we propose a graph attention-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (GatMARL) algorithm to learn the optimal task offloading and service caching strategies in the DITEN. The GatMARL employs a graph attention-based value decomposition network to capture the potential spatial relationships between edge nodes to learn better attentive cooperation policy.

To reduce the updating energy, this paper proposes a distributed edge cooperation and data collection scheme. The AI model is partitioned into multiple sub-models deployed on different edge servers (ESs) co-located with access points across wide-area, to update distributively using local sensor data. To reduce the updating energy, ESs can choose to become either updating helpers or recipients of their neighboring ESs, based on sensor quantities and basic updating convergencies. Helpers would share their updated sub-model parameters with neighboring recipients, so as to reduce the latter updating workload. To minimize system energy under updating convergency and latency constraints, we further propose an algorithm to let ESs distributively optimize their cooperation identities, collect sensor data, and allocate wireless and computing resources. It comprises several constraint-release approaches, where two child optimization problems are solved, and designs a large-scale multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation shows that the proposed scheme can efficiently reduce updating energy compared with the baselines.","1673-5447","","10.23919/JCC.fa.2023-0202.202308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10238412","digital twin;smart city;multi-agent deep reinforcement learning;resource allocation","Artificial intelligence;Optimization;Data collection;Predictive models;Monitoring;Data models;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","1 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

One typical advantage of DT is that it can be used to not only virtually replicate a system’s detailed operations but also analyze the current condition, predict the future behavior, and refine the control optimization. Although DT has been widely implemented in various fields, such as smart manufacturing and transportation, its conventional paradigm is limited to embody non-living entities, e.g., robots and vehicles. When adopted in human-centric systems, a novel concept, called human digital twin (HDT) has thus been proposed. Particularly, HDT allows in silico representation of individual human body with the ability to dynamically reflect molecular status, physiological status, emotional and psychological status, as well as lifestyle evolutions. These prompt the expected application of HDT in personalized healthcare (PH), which can facilitate the remote monitoring, diagnosis, prescription, surgery and rehabilitation, and hence significantly alleviate the heavy burden on the traditional healthcare system. However, despite the large potential, HDT faces substantial research challenges in different aspects, and becomes an increasingly popular topic recently. In this survey, with a specific focus on the networking architecture and key technologies for HDT in PH applications, we first discuss the differences between HDT and the conventional DTs, followed by the universal framework and essential functions of HDT. We then analyze its design requirements and challenges in PH applications. After that, we provide an overview of the networking architecture of HDT, including data acquisition layer, data communication layer, computation layer, data management layer and data analysis and decision making layer.

For the requirements of measurement efficiency and precision, robots and optical scanners are applied to measure free-form surface parts increasingly. Due to the complex geometry shapes and occlusions of these parts, how to plan accessible viewpoints of a scanner to achieve the expected coverage rate is a challenging task. This paper presents a novel viewpoint planning method based on the visibility cone space explorer (VP-VCSE) for robotic measurement systems with 7 degrees of freedom (7-DOF). A digital twin for the robotic measurement system is implemented to provide core services for robotic measurement tasks, including sensor simulation and collision detection. To generate initial candidate viewpoints, a novel mesh segmentation algorithm based on the hybrid mixture model is proposed, which is convenient to handle the triangular mesh of the target object. Visibility computation for a target object in given viewpoints is the key to dealing with the occlusion problem. For this purpose, a general visibility model of a structured-light scanner is presented to compute visible areas accurately. In order to reduce occlusions, a visibility cone space explorer is designed to search optimal candidate viewpoints considering inverse kinematics and physical collisions simultaneously. The viewpoint planning problem is formulated as a set covering optimization problem and a next-best-view operator is introduced to improve the efficiency of the genetic algorithm for searching the resultant viewpoint set, guaranteeing the expected coverage rate and data overlap rate. The simulation and experiment results for four different test models show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods in terms of the uncovered rate and the minimum number of viewpoints. Note to Practitioners—This paper addressed a viewpoint planning problem for the robotic measurement system with a binocular structured light 3D scanner mounted on the end effector of the robot, where a robot and a turntable cooperate to complete the measurement tasks. The goal is to find a minimal number of viewpoints that provides full coverage of the target surfaces. Although many studies have addressed this problem, there is little discussion about strategies to improve coverage rate when the target object has complex occlusions. This paper suggested a valuable practice to construct a visibility cone space to adjust viewpoint to reduce occlusions and improve the overall coverage rate. Simulation and experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. This paper showed how to deal with various constraints that a feasible viewpoint needs to satisfy in the viewpoint generation, viewpoint adjustment, and viewpoint selection phase. Moreover, this paper provided a solution for developing the visualization, simulation, and interaction of a digital twin for the 7-DOF robotic measurement system. All core services for robotic measurement tasks are implemented based on a set of open source libraries, which provides a convenient learning and research software platform for practitioners.

It is achievable because of the anytime, anywhere service access mechanism and machine-learning-based smart predictions over the cloud computing platform.

Unfortunately, the use of these technologies, in turn, intensifies the attack surface and poses a serious threat to the new goals of Industry 5.0, such as improving the user experience, sustainability and resilience.

However, one of the biggest difference between the sixth generation (6G) and its predecessor is the ability to support high speed connectivity of mobile services for global coverage, especially focusing on under-connected areas (e.g., forests, oceans, deserts, and mountains). Integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs) provide the best solution to unravel the unconnected issues of isolated areas not only on the ground but also in the air and on the sea. Despite this premise, the research in ISTNs is still in its infancy with many open problems, associated with long delay communications, large coverage for massive number of devices, and highly demanding real-time services. To alleviate these problems, this article introduces optimal multi-beam design empowered by machine learning techniques for 6G ISTNs, with respect to the real-time constraints of mission-critical services. First, we give an overview of the multibeam design for 6G ISTNs with user clustering approaches, energy-efficiency radio resource allocation, and distributed computing. Then, the frameworks for intelligent multibeam based on machine learning, real-time optimisation, and game theory, are proposed. As case studies, we investigate the performance of machine learning-aided real-time optimisation for 6G ISTNs in disaster relief and real-time optimal multibeam in satellite-terrestrial IoT networks.

However, scaling human activity recognition by the number of devices and users puts additional constraints on the available transmission channel. While transmitting less data saves bandwidth, removing redundant information from the data can also benefit machine learning. This paper addresses the problem of transmitting wearable sensor data for human activity recognition.

To achieve this goal, we design a loss function base on central moment discrepancy and high-temperature softmax. In addition, we conducted experiments on three distinct pairs of datasets and found that our proposed framework outperforms both training the student model from scratch on the target domain and simply fine-tuning the teacher and student models from the source domain to the target domain.

Second, as a vehicle would drive across consecutive edge servers, the offloading strategy needs to consider the overall edge resources along the trip. Third, at each vehicle, the computing tasks arrive continuously when driving. This dictates the offloading strategy to consider not only the current status but also the futuristic computing tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a digital twin (DT) network framework. A DT network maintains DTs in the cyber-space to synchronize the real-world activities of vehicles. Therefore, task offloading decisions can be benefited by combining both the global information aggregated from neighbor twins and historical information uploaded by vehicles. With comprehensive information, the optimal offloading strategy can be determined. We characterize the offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop an A3C-based decision-making algorithm, which can learn optimal offloading actions that minimize the long-term system costs.

Although there are constant attempts for automatic and semi-automatic image segmentation algorithm development, acquiring not only clinically accurate but also precise pixel-level annotations for medical images remains insufficient. This article presents a semi-supervised learning method with a novel fact-forcing process, referred to as FFSS, to reduce the labeling cost while improving the prediction accuracy for medical image segmentation. FFSS includes two components: a pre-trained teacher and a student that would be trained, iteratively. In each iteration, the teacher first generates a pseudo-label for each image in an unlabeled set, the student is then trained on the pseudo-labeled set and sends feedback to update the teacher. A fact-forcing process is designed to improve the quality of the student model using a labeled set. We have comprehensively evaluated our method on both three-dimensional binary segmentation and two-dimensional multi-class segmentation. The evaluation results demonstrate significant accuracy improvements of FFSS compared with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. Due to the fact-forcing process, the proposed method consistently outperforms the other ones under various labeled data ratios for all benchmark datasets, including left atrium MRI, pancreas CT, ACDC MRI, and OCT.

However, clean images are typically not available for most practical uses. To address this issue, we proposed a novel knowledge distillation method without clean images. By leveraging a property of the feature extractor in the classifier that naturally removes unrelated features for classification, we perform a simple training of the teacher model on noisy images, under the assumption that such a teacher can provide pseudo-clean features.

We formulate a multi-tier computation offloading optimization problem to minimize the weighted sum of total system delay and satellite energy consumption, where a LEO-layer problem and a DT-layer problem are involved. The LEO-layer problem optimizes the three-tier computation resource allocation and task splitting ratio. From the multi-satellite network perspective, the DT-layer problem optimizes how many resources will be shared between adjacent satellites.

The proposed MA-DATD3 algorithm is extended to solve the DT-layer problem in a centralized way, and the resource sharing between adjacent satellites is optimized to maximize the time-averaged reward.

But in physical systems, the parameters primarily depend on the state of the system. A mathematical model for a physical system with time-varying characteristics is therefore inappropriate. Simultaneously, based on online identification and prediction, experiments were developed to carry out interdisciplinary comprehensive experimental education and conform with the growth of the engineering disciplines. In this paper, an online DT-based DC motor system is present. A five-dimension model of the DT system is designed and implemented with the physical DC motor system, DT 3D model, mathematical model, real-time data, and the online DT platform. The model parameters can be calculated and the future state can be predicted using the online identification and prediction method. Experiments show the stability of the DT architecture.

Knowledge distillation aims to transfer knowledge from a larger and optimised teacher network to a smaller learnable network and is important for improving the accuracy of student models. Existing KD methods typically consider privileged information about the similarity/consistency between the class distribution or intermediate feature representations of the teacher and student models. However directly driving the student model to simulate the features of the teacher model largely ignores the knowledge/features that are not found in the student model learning the teacher model. In this paper we propose a new inter-channel correlation framework for knowledge extraction (IE-ICKD) that divides the student model into two parts, inheritance and exploration, where the inheritance part has transferred existing learning knowledge from the teacher model to the student model by simulating the feature space of the teacher model, while the exploration part is assigned to learn the feature space not learned by the simulated teacher model. Extensive experiments have shown that our proposed model enables better performance of the student model on the CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10 datasets, and it outperforms many existing methods.

This research presents a novel Respiration DT (ResDT) model based on Wi-Fi Carrier State Information (CSI), improved signal processing, and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for monitoring and classification (binary and multi-class) of patient respiration. A Wi-Fi sensor ESP32 with Wi-Fi CSI was utilized for the collection of respiration data. This provides an added advantage of unobtrusive monitoring of patient vital signs. The Patient’s Breaths Per Minute (BPM) is estimated from raw sensor data through the integration of multiple signal processing methodologies for denoising (smoothing and filtering) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, SVM, EMD, EMD-PCA). Multiple filters and dimensionality reduction methodologies are compared for accurate BPM estimation. The elliptical filter provides a relatively better estimation of the BPM with 87.5% accurate estimation as compared to other bandpass filters such as Butterworth (BF), Chebyshev type 1 Filter (CH1), Chebyshev type 2 Filter (CH2), and wavelet Decomposition (62.5%, 75%, 68.75%, and 75% respectively).

Early detection of pulmonary diseases play a major role in treatment. However, existing diagnostic techniques can be expensive, time-consuming, and require specialized expertise and any misdiagnosis can lead to delayed treatment. Lung auscultation is a widely used diagnostic technique that involves listening to respiratory sounds through a stethoscope which provide valuable information about the respiratory system and help in the identification of pulmonary diseases. However, interpretation of these sounds requires extensive training and experience. In this paper, we present the ”Pulmonet” system, which has been developed to identify pulmonary diseases by analyzing lung auscultation sounds. The methodology employed involves knowledge distillation, where valuable insights from a large and computationally intensive model (referred to as the teacher model) are transferred to a computationally efficient model (referred to as the student model). Our approach involves converting the respiratory sounds into Mel spectrogram images, which can be processed by our system. The model’s task is to make predictions about the presence of pulmonary diseases in a patient and identify the specific disease if any (such as Pneumonia, Upper Respiratory Tract Infection, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Bronchitis, Bronchiolitis) or classify them as healthy if no disease is detected. Following that, the insights acquired by the initial model are conveyed to the student model, which possesses lower computational complexity, making it feasible for deployment on mobile devices. Finding the suitable loss function for student model is crucial and challenging in our work. The loss function should be designed to balance both knowledge transfer and preservation of student model. In our work we have achieved the accuracy of 82% in teacher model and 78% in student model.","","979-8-3503-1821-0","10.1109/ICoAC59537.2023.10250003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10250003","Deep learning;MelSpectrogram;Knowledge distillation;Teacher model;Student Model","Training;Computational modeling;Pulmonary diseases;Lung;Stethoscope;Computational efficiency;Convolutional neural networks","","","","15","IEEE","19 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DTEN mainly collects real-time information of physical objects through edge nodes such as BSs and APs, and builds dynamic models on demand based on these information, which has the ability of description, diagnosis, prediction and decision-making. Aiming at the traffic management and resource allocation in DTEN, a QoE-driven wireless communication resource allocation method based on DTEN is proposed, and the overall architecture design of DTEN system is completed.

Without large labeled samples to support training, general remote sensing object recognition models have limited accuracy. Addressing this issue, this article proposes a weakly correlated distillation learning framework for remote sensing object recognition with a small number of samples. Benefitting from large-scale natural image datasets, many recognition models achieve superior feature extraction capabilities. Thus, we use them as backbones to build teacher models, and then fine-tune the teacher models with a small-scale remote sensing dataset. However, due to the limited number of remote sensing samples, the teacher models may produce noisy features that reduce the performance of the student model. Therefore, we propose a weakly correlated distillation method that selects the weakly correlated features from teacher models to distill the student. Since the weakly correlated features contain different noise distributions that can be mutually suppressed, thereby improving the performance of the student. Extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets of DOTA, HRRSD, and NWPU VHR-10 demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with the state of the arts (SOTA).

Recent studies demonstrate that transfer learning across multiple time series datasets does not always provide promising results, making self-supervised pre-training directly on the downstream dataset a temporarily considered optimal solution. To the best of our knowledge, the only general pre-training task in the time series field is the Masked Autoencoder. However, this approach may lead to redundant representations for downstream forecasting within DT systems. Therefore, we propose three pre-training tasks specially designed for time series forecasting within DT frameworks: Inverse Forecasting (IF), Coarser Forecasting (CF), and Anomaly Forecasting (AF). These tasks are respectively designed to capture bidirectional dependency, reduce noise, and augment data, all crucial aspects in enhancing the predictive capabilities of DT systems. By integrating the three tasks, we obtain a composite pre-training task which generally improves the forecasting results of time series models within DT systems across multiple datasets.

For SSD recognition, the SSD data are often insufficient and labels are scarce, making it hard to train a supervised deep model. In this article, we proposed a novel few-shot SSD recognition method based on self-supervised contrastive learning (self-SCL), which can effectively learn data representation with unlabeled data in the pretraining stage and learn categories from a few labeled samples in the fine-tuning stage. In this method, we proposed an information-guided teacher–student (TS) pretrained model with min–max instances similarity (MMIS) regularization. In the pretraining stage, we utilized the multicrop mechanism to build a teacher encoder (TE) with multiview information and leveraged the TE to guide the student encoder (SE) with information. Meanwhile, the SE also provided the TE with “questions” during the update process, which the SE also shared updated information with the TE for further refinement. Specifically, we introduced MMIS to address the problem of ambiguity between intraclass and interclass distances in SSD data. During the fine-tuning phase, we fine-tuned the pretrained model obtained by teacher–student with min–max instance similarity (TSMMIS) with a few labeled data and tested the SSD recognition accuracy in four SSD datasets. As the experimental results indicate, our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on the four SSD datasets.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2023.3315404","Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515010716,2021A1515011576,2017KCXTD015); Key Research Projects for Universities of Guangdong Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:2020ZDZX3031,2022ZDZX1032); Jiangmen Basic and Applied Basic Research Key Project(grant numbers:2021030103230006670); Jiangmen Science and Technology Plan Project(grant numbers:2220002000246,2022JC01021,2022JC01027); Jiangmen Major Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:202101009002624); Key Laboratory of Public Big Data in Guizhou Province(grant numbers:2019BDKFJJ015); Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macau and the Greater Bay Area International Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Project(grant numbers:2021A0505030080,2021A0505060011); Research on the Scheme of Intelligent Sensing Personnel Entering and Exiting Stations(grant numbers:HX22185); Development of a Container Intelligent Panoramic Trademark Quality Inspection System Based on Machine Vision(grant numbers:HX22105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260313","Deep learning;few-shot;self-supervised contrastive learning (self-SCL);steel surface defect (SSD) recognition","Data models;Task analysis;Steel;Generative adversarial networks;Transforms;Training;Surface treatment","","","","53","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the end energy users (e.g., prosumers) may tamper with their smart meters to mitigate the energy usage record fraudulently so as to reduce their payment, called energy theft. This behavior can result in poor energy management decision-making and economic losses for the power utilities. Therefore, it is pivotally important to take energy theft detection into consideration for ameliorating energy management. To this end, in this paper, an edge-assisted federated contrastive knowledge distillation (EFCKD) approach is proposed for energy management in terms of energy theft detection aspect towards a prosumer-based urban area, where gathering data in the power utility side is not required and the purpose is to achieve the average energy theft detection loss. Concretely, each client located on an edge server contains a local teacher model (LTM) and a local student model (LSM), where the LSM is a copy of the shared global student model (SGSM). The knowledge of each teacher network is distilled to teach the corresponding student network, while LSMs are collaboratively learned to update SGSM. In addition, model-contrastive learning is introduced to ameliorate performance. Experiments show that the proposed EFCKD outperforms the benchmarks since it can achieve the lowest average loss (0.0104).","2576-8565","978-89-950043-9-5","","Kyung Hee University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10258233","Prosumer-based urban area;energy theft detection;model-contrastive learning;knowledge distillation;federated learning","Knowledge engineering;Economics;Energy consumption;Image edge detection;Urban areas;Decision making;Benchmark testing","","","","30","","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Autonomous systems have a wide range of applications in artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, automated control and other fields, which can improve production efficiency, reduce costs, improve safety and reliability. However, most of the existing methods of autonomous systems are based on traditional machine learning or reinforcement learning. This paper proposes an algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to improve the learning efficiency of autonomous systems - LHU algorithm. The simulation dialogue experience is obtained from the interaction between autonomous systems and trainable user models. A posterior-session experience is the synthesis of successful session data by the posterior-module by acting on those failed session fragments and user goals. The dialogue experiences obtained from the user model and the posterior module provide more dialogue examples and positive feedback on dialogue strategy learning respectively.

The C2FR framework utilizes short-term forecasts and incorporates Reinforcement Learning Energy ($A_{E}$), Battery ($A_{BAT}$) and Load-Shifting ($A_{LS}$) agents to optimize and effectively manage the intricate dependencies and information exchange between these individual optimization strategies, thus overcoming the limitations of existing isolated approaches. When compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, the C2FR framework demonstrates its effectiveness across various data center scenarios. The AE agent achieves a 7.9% reduction in pollutant emissions and a 7.8% reduction in energy cost on average. Moreover, the C2FR framework enables further emission reductions through the application of the battery and load-shifting optimization, leading to a total reduction of 10.17% in pollutant emissions on average over different data center configurations.

With the rise of teleoperated manipulators, it is expected that tools that facilitate the interaction of humans with the remote environment will be more prevalent in industry, leading to a greater availability of them. This is the case with Virtual Fixtures (VFs), which are collections of abstract sensory information overlaid on top of reflected sensory feedback from a remote environment. Other ever more prevalent tools are Digital Twins (DTs), virtual representations of systems that facilitate bidirectional communication between the real and the virtual worlds. Being more likely than ever that factories have both an implemented Digital Twin of a system and VFs for a particular manipulation system, we propose a method to leverage both tools. In this paper, methods to integrate already existing VFs in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipeline and to use RL to construct an optimal VF to aid the human user in a telemanipulation task are proposed, tackling the cumbersome problems of reward function and VF design.

Subsequently, countless great people have invested their life in exchange for this enjoyment upon Human taste buds. However, even a three-Michelin-starred chef cannot remember the detailed steps to all the dishes, and ordinary citizens do not have the time or energy to create their recipes. This paper proposes an aid system that uses neural networks to achieve accurate recipe projections to facilitate life. A deep learning system based on Decoder and Encoder is implemented using CNN and Transformer. The CNN reduces the memory cost by transforming the image to a vector, achieving faster processing. The Transformer is used to determine ingredients' presence and combine the information of existing dishes to construct an instruction. Such a network can facilitate food production and research. It is making the creation of unique dishes convenient by revolutionizing the method of recording. After the model is created, the backbone network of CNN layers are manipulated to test for the best result. Backbone network tests include ResNet50, ResNet152 without attention, ResNet152 with attention, Vgg16, and AlexNet. Out of all tested, ResNet152 is resulted with the highest iou (Intersection over Union), and without-attention is chosen as it possesses less complexity than its counterpart. Then, knowledge distillation is applied to decrease the complexity and size of the model. This process used the complex model as a trainer to the student model by basing the student training on the result of the teacher model, achieving a similar level of accuracy with a significantly lower complexity and size. This decrease in complexity increases the portable capability of the model, potentially applying into applications and websites on devices in the future without consuming much memory.","","979-8-3503-1373-4","10.1109/ICSECE58870.2023.10263583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10263583","Neural networks;Ingredient detection;Convolution&max pooling;Recipe creation;Practice developmental;Knowledge Distillation","Knowledge engineering;Training;Taste buds;Neural networks;Production;Transformers;Complexity theory","","","","6","IEEE","29 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The datasets collected from the developed testbed are fed to the CKD framework, which transfers and fuses pose knowledge from a robust “Teacher” model to a parameterized “Student” model and can be a promising technique for obtaining accurate yet lightweight pose estimates. As a result, it becomes possible to identify the current pose of a human body (e.g., an elderly individual in a care home) solely using RF signals (e.g., WiFi signals in a home) without relying on visual signals or video information, meaning that this approach effectively addresses privacy concerns by allowing pose identification without compromising personal privacy. To ensure its efficacy, we implement CKD for distilling logits in our integrated software-defined radio (SDR)-based experimental setup and investigate the RF-visual signal correlation. Our CKD-RF sensing technique is characterized by two modes—a camera-fed teacher class network (e.g., images and videos) with an SDR-fed student class network (e.g., RF signals). Specifically, our CKD model trains a dual multibranch teacher–student network by distilling and fusing knowledge bases. The resulting CKD models are then subsequently used to identify the multimodal correlation and teach the student branch in reverse. Instead of simply aggregating their learnings, CKD training comprises multiple parallel transformations with the two domains, i.e., visual images and RF signals. Once trained, our CKD model efficiently preserves privacy and utilizes the multimodal correlated logits from the two different neural networks (NNs) to estimate poses solely using RF signals.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2023.3320131","School of IT, Deakin University, through the research program, CITECORE-RPI-2023 “Next-Generation IoT Communications Infrastructure, Analytics and Intelligence.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10271124","Body radio reflections;correlation;feature extraction;fusion;knowledge distillation;machine learning (ML);motion detection;pose monitoring;radio frequency (RF);RF-based vision;RF localization;RF sensing;RF signals;sensor phenomena and characterization;software-defined radio (SDR);wireless sensor networks","Chronic kidney disease;Sensors;Radio frequency;Visualization;RF signals;Cameras;Monitoring","","","","51","IEEE","3 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Beside optical component imperfections, eavesdropping and unpredicted environmental events occurred in the quantum channel increase quantum Bit Error Rate (qBER), which leads to further KER reduction. In this paper, we propose DARIUS, a digital twin for polarization encoded QKD systems that bridges the gap between perfect theoretical QKD systems and real implementations to: i) address optical components' non-ideal behavior; ii) discern eavesdropping from high qBER; and iii) dynamically compensate for environmental events. Taking advantage of DARIUS, even moderate eavesdropping rates can be distinguished from qBER.

Typically, FL requires a fixed group of participants that have Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data for accurate and stable model training, which is highly unlikely in real-world mobile network scenarios. In this paper, in order to facilitate the lightweight model training and real-time processing in high-speed mobile networks, we design and introduce an end-edge-cloud structured three-layer Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, incorporated with an edge-cloud structured DT system. A dual-Reinforcement Learning (dual-RL) scheme is devised to support optimizations of client node selection and global aggregation frequency during FL via a cooperative decision-making strategy, which is assisted by a two-layer DT system deployed in the edge-cloud for real-time monitoring of mobile devices and environment changes. A model pruning and federated bidirectional distillation (Bi-distillation) mechanism is then developed locally for the lightweight model training, while a model splitting scheme with a lightweight data augmentation mechanism is developed globally to separately optimize the aggregation weights based on a splitted neural network structure (i.e., the encoder and classifier) in a more targeted manner, which can work together to effectively reduce the overall communication cost and improve the non-IID problem.

At present, majority of Metaverse applications necessitate the manual construction of 3D models which is both time-consuming and costly.

To address this challenge, this PhD Forum paper proposes a novel approach to generate virtual worlds using digital twin (DT) technology and AI through a Text-to-Metaverse pipeline. This pipeline converts natural language input into a scene JSON, which is used to generate a 3D virtual world using two engines: Generative Script Engine (GSE) and Generative Metaverse Engine (GME). GME generates a design script from the JSON file, and then uses it to generate 3D objects in an environment. It aims to use multimodal AI and DT technology to produce realistic and highly detailed virtual environments. The proposed pipeline has potential applications including education, training, architecture, healthcare and entertainment, and could change the way designers and developers create virtual worlds.

However, the training of DRL relies on the frequent interactions between the UAVs and the environment, which consumes lots of energy due to the flying and communication of UAVs in practical experiments. Inspired by the growing digital twin (DT) technology, which can simulate the performance of algorithms in the digital space constructed by coping features of the physical space, the DT is introduced to reduce the costs of practical training, e.g., energy and hardware purchases. Different from previous DT-assisted works with an assumption of perfect reflecting real physics by virtual digital, we consider an imperfect DT model with deviations for assisting the training of multi-UAV networks. Remarkably, to trade off the training cost, DT construction cost, and the impact of deviations of DT on training, the natural and virtually generated UAV mixing deployment method is proposed. Two cascade neural networks (NN) are used to optimize the joint number of virtually generated UAVs, the DT construction cost, and the performance of multi-UAV networks.

When using immersive content utilizing these technologies, various interface methods are employed. Direct contact or wearable devices that can recognize user actions for interaction have physical limitations caused by the difficulty of accurately recognizing user movements and the use of surrounding equipment. Similarly, camera-based interfaces that recognize user actions have physical limitations due to wired connections to the main body and compatibility issues with other operating systems due to noncompliance to any global or national standards.In this paper, we propose a metaverse avatar teleport system based on user pose estimation using AIoT edge devices on the oneM2M IoT platform. The proposed system transmits the final human pose skeleton estimated by PoseNet to the Teleport Information Extractor after receiving the input image from the webcam. The teleport information extractor extracts four keypoints that serve as the basis for posture estimation for teleportation from the transmitted human pose skeleton and estimates one of the three postures for teleportation using those keypoints. The estimated teleport information is then sent from the IoT client M/W to the IoT server M/W.The metaverse interworking module, which is designed for integration with the metaverse, receives the Teleport Information through communication using HTTP and MQTT. And IoT server M/W transmits the teleport command corresponding to the received Teleport Information to the metaverse server, thereby repositioning the user avatar’s position and direction vector in the metaverse. This system is compatible with all devices that comply with the oneM2M standard and does not have spatial constraints when using content due to the use of network-based connections instead of wired connections.","","979-8-3503-3333-6","10.1109/MetaCom57706.2023.00131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10271892","virtual reality;metaverse;artificial intelligence of things;pose estimation;digital twin","Wrist;Metaverse;Avatars;Pose estimation;Teleportation;Skeleton;Digital twins","","","","12","IEEE","6 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a machine learning approach for distributed architectures, federated learning generates a global model for edge devices by only transferring model parameters, and it ensures that the private data of each device is not leaked. This is naturally suitable for solving this problem. Because devices' data cannot be exchanged with other devices, one major challenge is learning an effective model among devices with heterogeneous data. Motivated by this issue, we propose hierarchical federated learning using a hypernetwork (HN) algorithm to alleviate the influence of non-IID data among the devices, including label distribution skew, quantity skew, and feature distribution skew. The lower layer of our method uses hypernetworks to generate the parameters of the local model for the devices, while its upper layer updates hypernetworks by aggregating their model parameters. It decouples the number of parameters transmitted by the upper and lower layers, and it achieves good accuracy while improving communication efficiency and reducing computation costs.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2023.3322701","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171378); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10274139","Digital twin;federated learning;hierarchical architecture;hypernetworks;industrial IoT","Data models;Servers;Industrial Internet of Things;Computational modeling;Costs;Federated learning;Digital twins","","","","","IEEE","9 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) mechanisms have been developed to enable deterministic features in standard Ethernet. 5G and 6G networks are looking forward to integrate TSN and benefit from its ability to ensure determinism. Accommodating the complexity of TSN networks in 6G is not straightforward. In particular, conventional rule-based heuristic algorithms are not optimized for such environments. Therefore, the TSN network management framework should be equipped with the right tools allowing to compute at runtime new TSN configuration for each event (e.g. change in topology, new application, new device, etc.). To address this problem, recent standardization initiatives (IETF and ITU-T) have investigated the opportunities to use Network Digital Twin (NDT) paradigm for these use cases of 6G networks.This paper proposes a framework that puts together the key enablers to support NDT deployment for TSN-based public or private 6G network and to cope with the relevant challenges. In particular, we define a modular and self-learner NDT framework. To construct the DT model, the framework can rely on open source simulators/emulators with predefined models, or in other cases, it may learn the DT model from real infrastructure using Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) techniques trained over collected data.

Most of the advanced self-learning approaches are established based on machine learning and artificial intelligence, including reinforcement learning and game-theoretical method. However, because of the iterative behaviour during the learning processes, the learning processes are almost impossible to be conducted directly in a real-world manufacturing environment. One potential approach is to conduct the learning processes using the digital representation of the systems, e.g. the digital twin or simulation. Nonetheless, such representations in industrial settings are not always available and developing a digital representation of a complex system is immensely challenging. Hence, this problem can be solved through model-based learning, in which deep learning models are trained to predict the dynamics of the systems with a small margin of error. Then, the trained models are deployed as virtual environments for the learning processes of the GT-based control policies, instead of learning in the real world. In this study, we implement MBGT to a bulk good system and thoroughly analyse the performances between training in the real system and virtual environment, which eventually turn out to be positive effects.","1946-0759","979-8-3503-3991-8","10.1109/ETFA54631.2023.10275577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10275577","Model-based learning;smart manufacturing;game theory;industrial control;machine learning","Training;Deep learning;Digital representation;Virtual environments;Games;Reinforcement learning;Predictive models","","","","27","IEEE","12 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More and more organizations are investing in or purchasing insider threat detection systems to prevent insider risks. However, the accurate and timely detection of insider threats faces significant challenges. In this study, we proposed an intelligent insider threat detection framework based on Digital Twins and self-attentions based deep learning models. First, this paper introduces insider threats and the challenges in detecting them. Then this paper presents recent related works on solving insider threat detection problems and their limitations. Next, we propose our solutions to address these challenges: building an innovative intelligent insider threat detection framework based on Digital Twin (DT) and self-attention based deep learning models, performing insight analysis of users’ behavior and entities, adopting contextual word embedding techniques using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model and sentence embedding technique using Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) model to perform data augmentation to overcome significant data imbalance, and adopting temporal semantic representation of users’ behaviors to build user behavior time sequences. Subsequently, this study built self-attention-based deep learning models to quickly detect insider threats. This study proposes a simplified transformer model named DistilledTrans and applies the original transformer model, DistilledTrans, BERT + final layer, Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa) + final layer, and a hybrid method combining pre-trained (BERT, RoBERTa) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network model to detect insider threats. Finally, this paper presents experimental results on a dense dataset CERT r4.2 and augmented sporadic dataset CERT r6.2, evaluates their performance, and performs a comparison analysis with state-of-the-art models. Promising experimental results show that 1) contextual word embedding insert and substitution predicted by the BERT model, and context embedding sentences predicted by the GPT-2 model are effective data augmentation approaches to address high data imbalance; 2) DistilledTrans trained with sporadic dataset CERT r6.2 augmented by the contextual embedding sentence method predicted by GPT-2, outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of all evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Additionally, its structure is much simpler, and thus training time and computing cost are much less than those of recent models; 3) when trained with the dense dataset CERT r4.2, pre-trained models BERT plus a final layer or RoBERTa plus a final layer can achieve significantly higher performance than the current models with a very little sacrifice of precision.

One promising solution is the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which is a commercially attractive fuel cell that can support the implementation of decarbonization techniques for the transport sector. However, the unstable operation and undesired degradation will significantly shorten PEMFC's lifetime, which is a serious barrier to its commercialisation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a digital twin-enabled online remaining useful life prediction method for PEMFC, based on the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network and the quantile Huber loss (QH-loss). Our approach involves using a digital model that can be learned from a short period of online monitoring data and then used to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) for upcoming data.

Accurate determination of the histological type of lung cancer is crucial for developing appropriate treatment strategies. However, traditional medical imaging analysis, such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography (CT), faces challenges due to sensor noise, patient variations, and pathological states, which may lead to misinterpretation and errors. In this regard, deep learning approaches can assist in rapidly distinguishing different types of lung cancer by learning complex patterns and features from medical imaging data, aiding clinicians in precise diagnosis. This research aims to address the limitations of existing lung cancer classification models, including suboptimal accuracy, slow inference speed, high computational and storage requirements, and vulnerability to overfitting. To achieve this, we propose an improved lung cancer classification and detection method based on deep learning.

To enhance task performance and improve user management experience, we introduce optimized task scheduling and virtual object management based on a digital twin concept. Our system incorporates virtualization, synchronization, visualization, and simulation functionalities to provide digital twin capabilities.

In order to meet the demand of the product variety and short product lifecycle, the factory facilities including photogrammetry devices, should be relocated in response to rapid change in mechanical structure and hardware integration. Nevertheless, the camera position of the photogrammetry system is difficult to select to guarantee an optimal field of view (FoV) coverage of retro-reflective targets during the whole production horizon. Especially in a reconfigurable manufacturing work cell, scaling and calibration of a photogrammetry system requires professional skills and these would cost tremendous labour for rapid configuration each time. In this paper, we propose a novel deep optimisation framework for the photogrammetry camera position for the dynamic layout design based on digital twin. The optimisation framework follows an effective coarse-to-fine procedure to evaluate the FoV visibility over the target frame. In addition, the deep Q-learning algorithm is utilised to find the maximum FoV coverage and avoid collision. Three experiments are implemented to verify the application feasibility of the proposed deep camera position optimisation framework. Note to Practitioners—Large-volume in-process metrology is an essential element in flexible manufacturing systems. Quality of large-volume measurement relies heavily on target visibility within its field of view. In a compact industrial robotic cell, this is extremely challenging as the robot would take the primary position and causing view blockage throughout its operation. This makes the simultaneous monitoring of robot head and the work piece key feature extremely difficult. Manual trial-and-error positioning approach is lengthy and requires high level of expertise, due to both safety and spatial concerns. We approached this problem by simulating the camera’s view in a digital twin environment and maximising the target visibility throughout the full operation cycle. The generic framework can provide guidance in metrology setup within automated manufacturing environment, accelerate the system commissioning time, remove dependency of skill level and expand the capability for flexible/reconfigurable manufacturing systems. Although V-STARS camera are used in this application, the framework can be applied for other types of vision systems that requires field of view.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2023.3323088","Innovate U(grant numbers:0000DONOTUSETHIS0000.K,113235); Made Smarter Innovation—Research Centre for Connected Factories(grant numbers:EP/V062123/1); GKN Aerospace Ltd.; Nicolas Tanala; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10287916","Photogrammetry system;field of view;dynamic layout optimization;deep reinforcement learning;digital twin","Cameras;Digital twins;Optimization;Manufacturing;Layout;Production;Position measurement","","","","","IEEE","18 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In AR assisted driving, physical environment scenes are first captured by Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) and are uploaded to the Metaverse. A central Metaverse Map Service Provider (MMSP) will aggregate information from all IoVs to develop a central Metaverse Map. Information from the Metaverse Map can then be downloaded into individual IoVs on demand and be delivered as AR scenes to the driver. However, the growing interest in developing AR assisted driving applications which relies on digital twinning invites adversaries. These adversaries may place physical adversarial patches on physical world objects such as cars, signboards, or on roads, seeking to contort the virtual world digital twin. Hence, there is a need to detect these physical world adversarial patches. Nevertheless, as real-time, accurate detection of adversarial patches is compute-intensive, these physical world scenes have to be offloaded to the Metaverse Map Base Stations (MMBS) for computation. Hence in our work, we considered an environment with moving Internet of Vehicles (IoV), uploading real-time physical world scenes to the MMBSs. We formulated a realistic joint variable optimization problem where the MMSPs' objective is to maximize adversarial patch detection mean average precision (mAP), while minimizing the computed AR scene up-link transmission latency and IoVs' up-link transmission idle count, through optimizing the IoV-MMBS allocation and IoV up-link scene resolution selection. We proposed a Heterogeneous Action Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO) (discrete-continuous) algorithm to tackle the proposed problem. Extensive experiments shows HAPPO outperforms baseline models when compared against key metrics.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-7462-8","10.1109/ICC45041.2023.10279064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10279064","Metaverse;resource allocation;reinforcement learning;multi-agent;augmented reality;digital twin;Internet of Vehicles;adversarial","Measurement;Multi-access edge computing;Metaverse;Roads;Reinforcement learning;Real-time systems;Resource management","","","","31","IEEE","23 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the emergence of DTN mirrors a growing demand for bulk data transfer between geo-distributed DT nodes in the physical network infrastructure. Conventional end-to-end connections are facing a great challenge in the presence of the background traffic fluctuation. In this paper, we propose a graph convolutional network (GCN)-enabled scheduling method to schedule bulk data transfers across the DTN in a store-and-forward (SnF) manner. Instead of solving the complex SnF scheduling problem on the entire network, the proposed method decomposes the problem into multiple sub-problems on different pre-computed routes. Instead of learning the scheduling results directly, the GCN model is used to predict the reachability of DT nodes. These unreachable nodes will be excluded from the scheduling process.

In fact, Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) is a key to leveraging the unlabeled data on the client side while the confirmation bias issue triggered by incorrect predictions in the old-fashion Teacher-Student structure drops the model accuracy significantly. In this paper, we introduce the state-of-the-art SSL technique called Meta Pseudo Labels (MPL), which advocates a feedback strategy in the Teacher-Student architecture to mitigate the performance degradation. Unfortunately, in FL the heterogeneous data without sharing among clients are non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID). The knowledge that shuttles between the Teacher and Student model may be partial and undermine the effectiveness of MPL. To make a performance breakthrough, we proposed a novel FL framework called Federated Meta Learning with Synergetic Strategy (SynFMPL), which combines the advantages of both Teacher and Student models. To our best knowledge, we are the first work that integrates MPL technique in FL. Moreover, we specifically focus on the client side, which fully leverages the unlabeled data for model generalization. The experiment shows that SynFPML outperforms all baselines in various non-IID scenarios.

In this paper, we focus on cross-lightpath and cross-task application of TL for failure localization and failure detection in optical networks. We found that, depending on the number of retrained parameters in the ML model, cross-lightpath TL for failure localization provides satisfactory accuracy (higher than 90%, in some cases) with limited amounts of TD data, and is also convenient in terms of TD retraining duration with respect to cases where TL is not used.

Federated learning (FL) based DT model framework could be seen as an emerging paradigm to avoid large communication loads and high data leakage. However, the current digital twin model constructed scheme based on FL is not suitable for the heterogeneous IIoT scenario.

This, however, is typically associated with high channel acquisition/beam sweeping overhead that scales with the number of antennas. Machine and deep learning represent promising approaches to overcome these challenges thanks to their powerful ability to learn from prior observations and side information. Training machine and deep learning models, however, requires large-scale datasets that are expensive to collect in deployed systems. To address this challenge, we propose a novel direction that utilizes digital replicas of the physical world to reduce or even eliminate the MIMO channel acquisition overhead. In the proposed digital twin aided communication, 3D models that approximate the real-world communication environment are constructed and accurate ray-tracing is utilized to simulate the site-specific channels. These channels can then be used to aid various communication tasks. Further, we propose to use machine learning to approximate the digital replicas and reduce the ray tracing computational cost. To evaluate the proposed digital twin based approach, we conduct a case study focusing on the position-aided beam prediction task. The results show that a learning model trained solely with the data generated by the digital replica can achieve relatively good performance on real-world data. Moreover, a small number of real-world data points can quickly achieve near-optimal performance, overcoming the modeling mismatches between the physical and digital worlds and significantly reducing the data acquisition overhead.","2694-2941","979-8-3503-3307-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops57953.2023.10283592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10283592","Digital twin;MIMO;machine learning;real-world data;transfer learning;beam selection","Training;Deep learning;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Computational modeling;Ray tracing;Data models","","","","9","IEEE","23 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a sample-efficient digital twin-assisted beam pattern design framework that learns how to form the beam pattern to reject the signals from the interfering directions. The proposed approach does not require any explicit channel knowledge or any coordination with the interferers. The adoption of the digital twin improves the sample efficiency by better leveraging the underlying signal relationship and by incorporating a demand-based data acquisition strategy.

Specifically, we study the influence of adversaries on the training and development of federated learning models in digital twin 6G-enabled IoT environments. We demonstrate that attackers can carry out poisoning attacks in two different learning settings, namely: centralized learning and federated learning, and successful attacks can severely reduce the model's accuracy. We comprehensively evaluate the attacks on a new cyber security dataset designed for IoT applications with three deep neural networks under the non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data and the independent and identically distributed (IID) data. The poisoning attacks, on an attack classification problem, can lead to a decrease in accuracy from 94.93% to 85.98% with IID data and from 94.18% to 30.04% with Non-IID.","2694-2941","979-8-3503-3307-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops57953.2023.10283797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10283797","Poisoning attack;Federated Learning;IoT;6G;Security;Digital Twin","6G mobile communication;Training;Federated learning;Conferences;Distributed databases;Radar;Data models","","1","","9","IEEE","23 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these issues, existing model distillation techniques can transfer knowledge from large models to small models, reducing the model size and computational resource consumption while maintaining high performance. However, existing research has overlooked the privacy protection of input data and large models during the distillation process. In practical scenarios, the entities who train student models and own teacher models may be different institutions or countries, and how to protect the privacy of training data and teacher models is a challenge facing cross-institutional distillation learning. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving model distillation method combining random masking and threshold encryption systems. We introduce noise based on random masking into training data and encrypt the output of the teacher model, ensuring the privacy of the input data and teacher model while ensuring the performance of the distilled student model. We rigorously prove the security and correctness of the scheme in theory and validate its effectiveness through experiments. The experimental results show that the student model trained after data protection has a similar classification performance to the student model in the original distillation learning.","","979-8-3503-2738-0","10.1109/NaNA60121.2023.00087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10284816","distillation learning;privacy-preserving;random mask;threshold decryption cryptosystem","Training;Deep learning;Privacy;Costs;Computational modeling;Training data;Data protection","","","","22","IEEE","24 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, some other methods overly pursue the model's lightweight, which significantly decreases the model's precision and affects the experience of practical applications. However, in reality, fast and accurate applications are often more popular, so this area of research is of some practical significance. To achieve lightweight deployment and better practical application, A lightweight human pose estimation model based on knowledge distillation is proposed, which firstly uses group convolution and channel shuffle operation to lighten the HRNet model to obtain the S-HRNet model. Secondly, a response-based knowledge distillation algorithm is proposed to use the pre-trained HRNet as the teacher model and S-HRNet as the student model with the help of an offline knowledge distillation strategy, and the prediction results of the teacher model are used to supervise the learning of the student model together with the real labels. Finally, this paper conducts a large number of experiments on the MS COCO dataset proposed by Microsoft, and the experimental results show that the model in this paper has a higher average precision and lower number of parameters and computations compared to the other models mentioned.","","979-8-3503-2738-0","10.1109/NaNA60121.2023.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10284850","human pose estimation;knowledge distillation;lightweight model","Training;Convolution;Computational modeling;Pose estimation;Channel estimation;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","","","24","IEEE","24 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, many methods based on edge detection or deep learning were proposed for automatic cataract grading. However, these methods suffer a large performance drop in cortical cataract grading due to the more complex cortical opacities and uncertain data. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based Knowledge Distillation Network, called TKD-Net, for cortical cataract grading. To tackle the complex opacity problem, we first devise a zone decomposition strategy to extract more refined features and introduce special sub-scores to consider critical factors of clinical cortical opacity assessment (location, area, density) for comprehensive quantification. Next, we develop a multi-modal mix-attention Transformer to efficiently fuse sub-scores and image modality for complex feature learning. However, obtaining the sub-score modality is a challenge in the clinic, which could cause the modality missing problem instead. To simultaneously alleviate the issues of modality missing and uncertain data, we further design a Transformer-based knowledge distillation method, which uses a teacher model with perfect data to guide a student model with modality-missing and uncertain data. We conduct extensive experiments on a dataset of commonly-used slit-lamp images annotated by the LOCS III grading system to demonstrate that our TKD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, as well as the effectiveness of its key components.

Current available machine-learning solutions are either based on shallow networks unable to capture complex features from input graph data or on deep networks with overshooting complexity in the case of large number of sensors. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new framework for sensor validation based on a deep recurrent graph convolutional architecture which jointly learns a graph structure and models spatio-temporal interdependencies. More specifically, the proposed two-block architecture 1) constructs the virtual sensors in the first block to refurbish anomalous (i.e., faulty) behavior of unreliable sensors and to accommodate the isolated faulty sensors and 2) performs the detection and isolation tasks in the second block by means of a classifier.

However, as with any educational technology, proper handling and well-planned selection are crucial for successful teaching. Correspondingly, the requirements that tasks have to fulfill are wide-ranging: they should promote specific learning outcomes, be appropriate to address desired cognitive dimensions, and be tailored to the student to keep motivation and learning success high. To enable an on-demand, outcome-oriented, and individualized selection of tasks in adaptive learning systems, we need to formalize tasks in all dimensions.

The AI model is partitioned into a large amount of sub-models onto different edge servers (ESs) co-located with access points to simulate every part of the wide-area, which are distributed updated using locally-collected data. To reduce system energy, ESs can choose to become either updating helpers or recipients of their neighboring ESs, based on their available sensors and basic updating convergences. Helpers share their updated parameters with their neighboring recipients to reduce the latter workload. To minimize system energy, the paper further proposes a distributed algorithm to adaptively optimize ESs cooperative identities, data collections and heterogenous resource allocations in the dynamic environment.

In this paper, we introduce a novel microservice offloading algorithm, DTDRLMO, which leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and digital twin technology. Specifically, we employ digital twin techniques to predict and adapt to changing edge node loads and network conditions of CEC in real-time. Furthermore, this approach enables the generation of an efficient offloading plan, selecting the most suitable edge node for each microservice. Simulation results on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DTDRLMO outperforms heuristic and learning-based methods in average service completion time.","2155-6814","979-8-3503-2433-4","10.1109/MASS58611.2023.00012","Impact Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10298284","Microservice offloading;deep reinforcement learning;digital twin;collaborative edge computing","Learning systems;Simulation;Microservice architectures;Reinforcement learning;Channel allocation;Dynamic scheduling;Real-time systems","","","","30","IEEE","1 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The student model learns directly from high-confidence pseudo-labels. By using the confident learning method in low-confidence pseudo-labels, the teacher model corrects the noisy labels in low-confidence voxels to provide positive feature information for the student model.

The 3D point cloud data collected by it contains rich 3D spatial information, and the surface description of objects is also close to reality, which helps people perceive complex scenes. In recent years, the deep learning-based lidar 3D point cloud data processing method has received widespread attention, realizing automatic feature learning from large amounts of data and realizing target detection and semantic segmentation of complex scenes. Among them, most methods need to learn model parameters based on a large amount of labeled data. However, the annotation of 3D point cloud data is more time-consuming and laborious than that of 2D images. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a point cloud data labeling method based on the combination of semi-supervised learning and knowledge distillation. Firstly, the existing point cloud data is denoised by the improved three-dimensional guided filtering method to remove useless noise. Then, the classic Bilateral Augmentation and Adaptive Fusion (BAAF) point cloud semantic segmentation model is used as the teacher model. Moreover, to enhance the point cloud data, the local semantic context of the pyramid is introduced. We further generate high-quality pseudo-labels through the class range balance module. Finally, the rapid training of the student model is completed through the teacher averaging method in knowledge distillation and the obtained pseudo-labels. During the experiment, we discuss the labeling effect on the point cloud data of the public SemanticKITTI dataset and compare it with the scribble-annotated ScribbleKITTI data, to verify the ability of the proposed method.","","979-8-3503-2949-0","10.1109/ICBASE59196.2023.10303071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10303071","3D point cloud;3D guided filtering;point cloud semantic segmentation;semi-supervised learning;knowledge distillation","Point cloud compression;Training;Adaptation models;Three-dimensional displays;Laser radar;Filtering;Semantic segmentation","","","","22","IEEE","3 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, despite the significant potential in agriculture, especially mushroom cultivation, there are still some problems, such as a gap between yields and market demand, because mushroom cultivators cannot produce optimal mushroom production in quality and quantity. Proper and effective cultivation processes must be carried out to produce quality oyster mushroom products in large quantities. Implementing the digital twin concept by utilizing Internet of Things and Machine Learning technology will have many good impacts to make it easier for mushroom cultivators to monitor oyster mushroom cultivation. The digital twin concept will focus on characteristics so it can represent physical objects as closely as possible. IoT will playa massive role in providing data in real-time through sensors so that things that cannot be seen physically can be known based on their data and machine learning will support the virtual modeling process so that monitoring data for mushroom growth will be available in real time according to their respective characteristics. Implementing the digital twin concept in the mushroom cultivation monitoring system requires five stages: creation, communication, aggregation, analysis, and insight. Based on the research, the digital twin concept has a huge opportunity to optimize the mushroom cultivation process because it will help mushroom cultivators know the mushroom's environmental and physical conditions in real time.

In virtue of the flourishing of edge intelligence and abundant IoT data, data-driven modelling facilitates the implementation and maintenance of digital twins, where simulations of physical objects are usually performed based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). A significant advantage of adopting digital twins is to enable decisive prediction on the behaviours of objects in near future without waiting for that really happen. To provide accurate predictions, it is vital to keep each digital twin synchronized with its physical object in real-time. However, it is challenging to maintain the real-time synchronization between a digital twin and its physical object due to the dynamics of physical objects and sensing data drift over time, i.e., the live data from a physical object diverge from the model training data of its digital twin. To address this critical issue, continual learning is a promising solution to retrain models of digital twins incrementally. In this paper, we investigate digital twin synchronization issues via continual learning in an MEC environment, with the aim to maximize the total utility gain, i.e., the enhanced model accuracy. We study two novel optimization problems: the static digital twin synchronization problem per time slot and the dynamic digital twin synchronization problem for a finite time horizon. We first formulate an Integer Linear Program (ILP) solution for the static digital twin synchronization problem when the problem size is small; otherwise, we develop a randomized approximation algorithm at the expense of bounded resource violations for it. We also devise a deterministic approximation algorithm with guaranteed performance for a special case of the static digital twin synchronization problem.

With the rapid increase of DERs, it becomes increasingly important to improve the visibility of the distribution networks to ensure the critical system operating constrains are continuously met. DTs are virtual replicas of physical systems, and with certain live measurement data, they can be used to accurately represent the real-time dynamics of the physical entities.

More recently, balancing the temperature among the cells has become a research topic. In our work, we consider a dual-balancing problem where we aim to balance both the parameters of the state of charge and temperature. We consider a Smart Battery Pack, where individual cells can be bypassed, meaning that no current is going to or from the cell, which allows the cell to cool off while the cell does not charge or discharge. Moreover, a smart battery pack can estimate each cell's characteristics, which, in turn, can be used to define a model of cell and battery pack behavior. We conduct experiments using the model of a battery pack where each cell differs in its configuration as an effect of aging. For such a pack with heterogeneous cells, we use Q- Learning in U ppaal Stratego to synthesize a controller that maximizes the time spent in a balanced state, meaning that all cells' states are within a specific range of each other. We show significant improvements in two aspects compared with two threshold-based controllers that balance either state of charge or temperature. The synthesized controllers are only unbalanced with the state of charge between 1-4% of the time and for temperature between 15-20% of the time. The threshold-based controllers are either unbalanced for the state of charge for as much as 37 % of the time or for temperature for as much as 44 % of the time.

To tackle the formulated non-convex optimization problem, we first model it as a Markov decision process (MDP).

Electric vehicles (EVs) and charging stations (CSs) are essential components of the IoT system, offering business opportunities for companies like the aggregator. The aggregator can maximize profit by implementing various CSs management strategies, such as pricing and charging scheduling. However, managing CSs presents challenges due to irrational human behavior, particularly uncertain CS selections by EV users. To address this issue, we propose a cooperative model for CSs that incorporates the cognitive hierarchy quantum response CS selection model. In this model, EV users are considered to possess k-level rationality, and the charging environment is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) based on this user model. To make optimal decisions for CSs from the MDP, we propose a denoising autoencoder-based deep reinforcement learning (DEEDRL) method. This method learns from the uncertain environment and effectively denoises the state space using a pre-trained autoencoder. In addition, to reduce the computational burden caused by time-varying strategies, we design a discretization strategy for action space based on the current market rule of tiered pricing and CS types. Our experiments with real data demonstrate that our proposed method accurately portrays the CS selection behavior of irrational users in realistic scenarios. Furthermore, our method outperforms non-cooperative modes and benchmark cooperative algorithms regarding profitability, such as DDPG and DQN.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3334027","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:No. 62001412); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10323291","Multiple charging stations;electric vehicles;cognitive hierarchy CS selection;pricing and scheduling","Pricing;Behavioral sciences;Optimal scheduling;Scheduling;Internet of Things;Costs;Decision making","","","","","IEEE","20 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

By training the model based on historical data, the model should be able to predict system behavior based on streaming data inputs. Most models are static, but the streaming data may be non-stationary in the case of relevant factors, and that discretization of numeric data streams is perceived as undesirable. We argue that it can be desirable for a discretization to evolve in synchronization with an evolving data stream. We investigate the discretization of various streaming data from the equipment and implement computationally efficient incremental discretization algorithms. We show that allowing a discretization to drift in synchronization with distribution drift can further identify anomalies, detect potential issues, and predict future behavior based on real-time data. The incorporation of incremental discretization into the model enables continuous updates, leading to a more accurate representation of the renewable integration equipment. This improved accuracy facilitates better decision-making and optimization of renewable integration performance.","","978-1-83953-949-7","10.1049/icp.2023.2239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10324538","","","","","","","","21 Nov 2023","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The age of data, defined as the time difference between the generation time of a dataset and the current time, is widely adopted as a key criterion to evaluate both timeline and quality of training. In this paper, we study the problem of age-aware FCL in a mobile edge computing (MEC) network.

In real application scenarios, there are usually multiple FCL requests that require to train models, and delays in the MEC network are usually uncertain. We then study the problem of age-aware data selection and aggregator placement problem for FCL with uncertain delays and multiple requests, by devising an online learning algorithm with a bounded regret based on contextual bandits. We finally implement a prototype for FCL in an MEC network, with various heterogeneous user equipments (UEs) and cloudlets with different computing capabilities in the network.

E-learning applications present a solution for the continuity of the learning process. Learner models have been intensively applied in the learning system to improve online learning. In order to achieve this objective, it is imperative to use adaptive learning systems because learners do not have the same mental capacities and similar physical characteristics. In fact, each learner has individual features such as knowledge, goals, experiences, interests, backgrounds, personal traits, learning styles, learning activities, and study results. To make the learning content available for all learners, facilitate the learning process, and meet the learner's needs, an adaptive learning system was introduced as an alternative to the standard and traditional ""one-size-fits-all"". The learner model is the pivot of any adaptive learning environment, which permits the improvement of the learning process. This paper introduces a new learner model including 2 dimensions: (1) static dimensions (demographic information, interests, background, experience, learning style preference and learning situation), and (2) dynamic dimensions (Learning materials, emotion, motivation, engagement, and interaction). The developed model is applied to improve the learning process and enhance the learning results in any learning situation. Our approach is a combination of many methods and techniques to initialize and update the learner model for learning personalization.

This paper serves as a snapshot of the current state of the art addressing the pivotal role of point cloud techniques in advancing railway digitalisation and providing valuable pointers for future research directions. Employing a systematic review approach, our study concentrates exclusively on research centred around railway assets and their digitalisation via point cloud data. We have themed the literature into pre-processing, modelling, and digital twinning. Within this review, we analyse diverse modelling and pre-processing techniques and categorise them for clarity. The digital twin techniques are also collected, though these techniques are scarce in the context of railway infrastructure and point clouds. The paper also presents a compilation of dataset statistics highlighting the scarcity of openly available railway-specific datasets. This scarcity considerably hampers the feasibility of research reproducibility and the comparative analysis of different approaches. Our conclusion reflects on the challenges encountered and proposes a course for future research. Particularly, we conclude that hybrid methodologies that combine machine learning with structure-based techniques hold substantial promise toward creating digital twins, considering the intrinsic characteristics of railway infrastructure.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3337049","Tech For Future Grant 2207 “Digital Twinning voor Spoorontwerp” and Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO)(grant numbers:NWA.1160.18.238); University of Twente and the Saxion University of Applied Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10328827","Railways;point clouds;digitalization;infrastructure;deep learning;digital twin","Rail transportation;Point cloud compression;Lasers;Databases;Systematics;Digital twins;Laser radar;Deep learning","","","","102","CCBYNCND","27 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead of determining the collaboration for each DNN inference task only upon its generation, multi-step decision-making is performed during the on-device inference to adapt to the dynamic computing workload status at the device and the edge server. To enhance the adaptivity, a DT is constructed to evaluate all potential offloading decisions for each DNN inference task, which provides augmented training data for a machine learning-assisted decision-making algorithm. Then, another DT is constructed to estimate the inference status at the device to avoid frequently fetching the status information from the device, thus reducing the signaling overhead.

However, the importance of network traffic prediction as an essential prerequisite module for these network tasks has been relatively overlooked. Limited surveys provide insights into the network traffic characteristics and advanced prediction models, resulting in performance degradation and unnecessary resource consumption. Hence, it deserves to explore an efficient data-driven traffic prediction framework that can adapt to different network tasks.

Typically, most existing KD methods work on well-labeled data. Unfortunately, real-world data often inevitably involve noisy labels, thus leading to performance deterioration of these methods. In this article, we study a little-explored but important issue, i.e., KD with noisy labels. To this end, we propose a novel KD method, called ambiguity-guided mutual label refinery KD (AML-KD), to train the student model in the presence of noisy labels. Specifically, based on the pretrained teacher model, a two-stage label refinery framework is innovatively introduced to refine labels gradually. In the first stage, we perform label propagation (LP) with small-loss selection guided by the teacher model, improving the learning capability of the student model. In the second stage, we perform mutual LP between the teacher and student models in a mutual-benefit way. During the label refinery, an ambiguity-aware weight estimation (AWE) module is developed to address the problem of ambiguous samples, avoiding overfitting these samples. One distinct advantage of AML-KD is that it is capable of learning a high-accuracy and low-cost student model with label noise. The experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets show the effectiveness of our AML-KD against state-of-the-art KD methods and label noise learning (LNL) methods.

To circumvent the non-parallelizability of recurrent-based equalizers, we propose, for the first time, knowledge distillation (KD) to recast the biLSTM into a parallelizable feed-forward 1D-convolutional NN structure. In this work, we applied KD to the cross-architecture regression problem, which is still in its infancy.

Additionally, we provide a comparative study of the performance of the NN-based equalizers for both the teacher and the students with different NN architectures. The performance comparison was carried out in terms of the Q-factor, inference speed, and computational complexity. The equalization performance was evaluated using both simulated and experimental data. The 1D-CNN outperformed other NN types as a student model with respect to the Q-factor.

The high mobility in multi-hop IoVs reduces reliability and energy efficiency, and becomes bottleneck for the optimal route solution using classical optimization methods. To a great extent, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method is not applicable in IoVs environment because of the continuously changing topology and space complexity, which grows exponentially with the number of state variables as well as the relaying hops. Usually, in multi-hop scenario, network reliability and latency are affected by mobility as well as average hop count, which limit the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) link connectivity. To cope with this problem, in this paper, we formulate a minimum hop count delay-sensitive buffer-aided optimization problem in a dynamic complex multi-hop vehicular topology using a digital twin-enabled dynamic coordination graph (DCG). Particularly, for the first time, a DCG-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DCG-MADDPG) decentralized algorithm is proposed that combines the advantage of DCG and MADDPG to model continuously changing topology and find the optimal routing solutions by cooperative learning in the aforementioned communications. The proposed DCG-MADDPG coordinated learning trains each agent towards highly reliable and low latency optimal decision-making path solutions while maintaining queue stability and convergence on the way to a desired state. Experimental results reveal that the proposed coordinated learning algorithm outperforms the existing learning in terms of energy consumption and latency at less computational complexity.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3338020","Independent University, Bangladesh; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10335755","Multi-agent learning;IoV;dynamic graph;Stochastic process;MADDPG","Reliability;Network topology;Vehicle dynamics;Delays;Topology;Digital twins;Heuristic algorithms","","","","","IEEE","30 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In order to handle the large amounts of network data based on digital twins (DTs), wireless systems can exploit the paradigm of semantic communication (SC) for facilitating informed decision-making under strict communication constraints by utilizing AI techniques such as causal reasoning. In this paper, a novel framework called causal semantic communication (CSC) is proposed for DT-based wireless systems. The CSC system is posed as an imitation learning (IL) problem, where the transmitter, with access to optimal network control policies using a DT, teaches the receiver using SC over a bandwidth-limited wireless channel how to improve its knowledge to perform optimal control actions. The causal structure in the transmitter’s data is extracted using novel approaches from the framework of deep end-to-end causal inference, thereby enabling the creation of a semantic representation that is causally invariant, which in turn helps generalize the learned knowledge of the system to new and unseen situations. The CSC decoder at the receiver is designed to extract and estimate semantic information while ensuring high semantic reliability. The receiver control policies, semantic decoder, and causal inference are formulated as a bi-level optimization problem within a variational inference framework. This problem is solved using a novel concept called network state models, inspired from world models in generative AI, that faithfully represents the environment dynamics leading to data generation. Furthermore, the proposed framework includes an analytical characterization of the performance gap that results from employing a suboptimal policy learned by the receiver that uses the transmitted semantic information to construct a model of the physical environment. The CSC system utilizes two concepts, namely the integrated information theory principle in the theory of consciousness and the abstract cell complex concept in topology, to precisely express the information content conveyed by the causal states and their relationships. Through this analysis, novel formulations of semantic information, semantic reliability, distortion, and similarity metrics are proposed, which extend beyond Shannon’s concept of uncertainty. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CSC system outperforms conventional wireless and state-of-the-art SC systems by achieving better semantic reliability with reduced bits and enabling better control policies over time thanks to the generative AI architecture.","2641-8770","","10.1109/JSAIT.2023.3336538","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-2210254); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071193); Major Key Project of Peng Cheng Laboratory(grant numbers:PCL2023AS1-2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10335924","Semantic communication;imitation learning;integrated information theory;model-based reinforcement learning;and causal inference","Semantics;Wireless communication;Receivers;Data models;Computational modeling;Transmitters;Artificial intelligence","","","","47","IEEE","30 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In displaying DTs, Holographic-Type Communication (HTC) provides immersive multimedia access for users to interact with Holographic DTs (HDTs) by transmitting holographic data such as Light Field (LF) and other multisensory information. HDT has applications in remote education, work, and social interactions. However, the effective matching of demand and supply between HDT users and providers remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical architecture that integrates the DT and HTC paradigms. This architecture incorporates a marketplace for HDT services, leveraging a formulated Double Dutch Auction (DDA) mechanism to optimize matching and pricing based on user and provider valuation. Furthermore, We employ an actor-critic-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to train a DDA auctioneer that dynamically adjusts auction clocks during the auction process.

However, most traditional deep learning frameworks, such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and multilayer perceptrons, find it difficult to learn continuous-time and nonlinear system models. To address this challenge, in this paper, a novel deep learning method called neural controlled differential equation has been proposed to model the unknown nonlinear dynamics of controlled continuous-time systems seen in Francis hydroturbines of hydropower systems. Following the development of discretized-model structures for the system using the first principles, a detailed learning algorithm is formulated that is integrated with the physical model of the hydroturbine. As a result, a hybrid modeling with effective learning capability is obtained. To test the effectiveness of the proposed learning algorithm, a set of operational data has been collected and used to train the nonlinear dynamics of the Francis hydroturbine, where the learning results of the two nonlinear dynamics, namely the mechanical torque and water flow dynamics, using the real data have indicated that the proposed method can accurately learn these unknown nonlinear dynamics in an online, adaptive way. Moreover, to address the overfitting problem that appears during the online training phase, we propose to apply a meta-learning technique to pre-train a meta-initial value for each parameter of the proposed neural controlled differential equations.

From the perspective of collaborative, secure communication, this paper proposes a secure transmission scheme for power grid CPS based on physical layer security and deep reinforcement learning. Grid transmission nodes select idle trusted devices as relay transmission nodes. Signals are transmitted between nodes through narrow directional beams, which alleviates blocking effects and prevents eavesdroppers from obtaining good eavesdropping capacity.

Precise and real-time estimation of energy consumption for them is imperative for effective itinerary planning and optimizing vehicle systems, which can reduce driving range anxiety and decrease energy costs. As public awareness of data privacy increases, adopting approaches that safeguard data privacy in the context of BEV energy consumption modeling is crucial. Federated Learning (FL) is a promising solution mitigating the risk of exposing sensitive information to third parties by allowing local data to remain on devices and only sharing model updates with a central server. Our work investigates the potential of using FL methods, such as FedAvg, and FedPer, to improve BEV energy consumption prediction while maintaining user privacy. We conducted experiments using data from 10 BEVs under simulated real-world driving conditions. Our results demonstrate that the FedAvg-LSTM model achieved a reduction of up to 67.84% in the MAE value of the prediction results. Furthermore, we explored various real-world scenarios and discussed how FL methods can be employed in those cases.

With the recent advances in modelling tools and diagnostics, there is an opportunity to fuse this knowledge with emerging ML techniques towards creating a battery digital twin. In this paper, we propose a data-driven digital twin of EV batteries in order to support the implementation of predictive analytics algorithms.

Although combinations of distillation techniques and meta-learning paradigms have been acknowledged as the primary strategies for FSOD tasks, the existing distillation methods exhibit inherent biases and sensitivity to novel class variability. A critical hurdle for FSOD distillation is the difficulty in ensuring appropriate knowledge learned from the teacher model during the fine-tuning stage. Furthermore, coarse distillation procedures risk misalignment between the learned and actual distributions. This misalignment could potentially negate the benefits of positive cases and impede the detector’s evolution. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel self-distillation paradigm exclusively for the fine-tuning stage (SD-FSOD). Our methods integrate a Distribution Prototype Extractor (DPE) and Self-Distillation Memory (SDM), promoting feature distribution consistency during distillation. In detail, the DPE module reliably initializes the weights of the detector, ensuring a robust class distribution for the distillation process. Meanwhile, the SDM module utilizes decoupling techniques to divide the distillation tasks into two sub-task branches, allowing the student model to independently learn and share precise features through isolated distillation processes. The synergistic integration of feature calibration techniques and the continuous self-distillation paradigm distinctly enhances the fine-tuning process, which shows the superiority of the FSOD self-distillation methodologies. The extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach produces significant improvements and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2023.3343397","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62162008); Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project for Overseas Educated Talents in Guizhou Province(grant numbers:(2022)-04); Guizhou Provincial Science and Technology Projects(grant numbers:ZK[2022]108); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10361284","Few-Shot Object Detection;Self-Distillation;Distribution Prototype;Decoupled Sub-tasks","Prototypes;Task analysis;Object detection;Feature extraction;Calibration;Predictive models;Detectors","","","","","IEEE","15 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It also creates a potential for attackers to tamper with the data content and conduct different IoV-related attacks. To address these issues, a new framework called “STIoV” has been proposed for secure and trustworthy communication in IoV. The framework includes a mutual authentication scheme to register and exchange session keys among the IoV participants, and a credit-based trust management system to assign reputation scores for the vehicular devices. The latter scheme discards transactions with low credit scores. To overcome the complexity and variability of the IoV network, digital twin technology is used to map Road Side Units (RSU) servers into virtual space, which facilitates constructing the vehicular relation model. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on deep learning techniques is also introduced to detect anomalies in the traffic flow. The legitimate data is further used by the blockchain scheme for transaction verification, block creation and addition. Finally, the proposed framework has been evaluated based on two network intrusion datasets, and the results show the accuracy and efficacy of STIoV in comparison to several recent state-of-the-art solutions.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2023.3342127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10363688","Digital Twin;Deep Learning;Blockchain;Internet of Vehicles (IoV);Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Trustworthiness","Security;Servers;Radio access networks;Cloud computing;Blockchains;Trust management;Digital twins","","","","","IEEE","18 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, the use of low-density EEG montages often leads to a loss in EEG decoding performance due to the reduced number of electrodes and limited coverage of scalp regions. To address this issue, we introduce knowledge distillation (KD), a learning mechanism developed for transferring information between neural network models, to enhance the performance of low-density EEG decoding.

However, as the performance improves, the memory resources and computational requirements of the model also increase, making it difficult to directly apply them to edge computing. Therefore, various model compression and acceleration techniques are desired. This paper proposes a learning method that dynamically uses Knowledge Distillation (KD) to teach a small student model from a large teacher model by considering the learning ratio from the teacher’s output and the real target based on reinforcement learning (RL). During the KD learning process, RL is adopted to estimate the learning ratio by considering the reward favoring the hard target (clean speech) or the soft target (the output of the teacher model) during the training of KD. The proposed method results in a more stable training process for the resulting smaller SE model and yields improved performance. In the experiment, we used the TIMIT and CSTR VCTK datasets and evaluated two representative SE models that employ different loss functions. On the TIMIT dataset, when we reduced the number of parameters in the Wave-U-Net student model from 10.3 million to 2.6 million, our method performed better than non-KD models with improvements of 0.05 in PESQ, 0.1 in STOI, and 0.47 in the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio. Moreover, by utilizing prior knowledge from the pre-trained teacher model, our method effectively guided the learning process of the student model, achieving excellent performance even under low SNR conditions. Furthermore, we use Conv-Tasnet to further validate our proposed method. Finally, for ease of comparison, we conducted a comparison on the VCTK dataset as well.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3343738","National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan(grant numbers:111-2221-E-006-150-MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10363197","Deep learning;speech enhancement;knowledge distillation;reinforcement learning","Training;Speech enhancement;Computational modeling;Signal to noise ratio;Data models;Task analysis;Time-domain analysis;Deep learning;Knowledge discovery;Information filtering;Reinforcement learning","","","","48","CCBYNCND","18 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, traditional student team building methods usually have strong randomness or involve only some first-class students. To choose more suitable students to compose a team and improve students’ abilities overall, a competition-oriented student team building method is proposed. This would not only lead to better competition results by choosing more suitable students and teams but also improve the overall involvement of students in considering education fairness. First, a big data platform is constructed to collect students’ various behavior data. Based on that, a competition with a six-tuple attribute and a student with a six-tuple attribute are modeled. Then, a corresponding utility function is designed for each attribute in the student model to denote the student's utility in this attribute for attending a competition. Furthermore, a team utility function is developed for each team to denote the utilities of all involved students. A team building utility function is also developed to denote the utilities of all involved teams. Second, a multiple-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm with dimension by dimension improvement is proposed to build appropriate teams to optimize team building utility maximization and education fairness simultaneously. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that overall performance, not only our proposed team building method has better performance in terms of team utility and student ability than other current methods, but also our proposed multiple-objective optimization algorithm has better performance in terms of hyper volume and inverted generational distance than other optimization algorithms.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2023.3343525","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB4500800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62032013); Natural Science Basic Research Fund of Liaoning Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:LJC202002); Postgraduate Education Reform Project of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:LNYJG2022012, 2021 Annual Project in 14th Five-Year Plan of Liaoning Provincial Education Science,JG21DB242); Postgraduate Education Reform Project of Liaoning University(grant numbers:YJG202301055); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10364715","Academic competition;collaborative learning;computer uses in education;team building","Buildings;Optimization;Education;Behavioral sciences;Technological innovation;Particle swarm optimization;Sorting","","","","","IEEE","18 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Due to the limited bandwidth, we propose to use semantic extraction algorithms to reduce the delivered data by the sensing IoT devices. Nevertheless, mechanisms to hire sensing IoT devices to share their data with the VSP and then deliver the constructed digital twin to the Metaverse users are vulnerable to adverse selection problem. The adverse selection problem, which is caused by information asymmetry between the system entities, becomes harder to solve when the private information of the different entities are multi-dimensional. We propose a novel iterative contract design and use a new variant of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to solve the modelled multi-dimensional contract problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we conduct extensive simulations and measure several key performance metrics of the contract for the Metaverse. Our results show that our designed iterative contract is able to incentivize the participants to interact truthfully, which maximizes the profit of the VSP with minimal individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC) violation rates.

To reduce the energy costs and carbon footprint of industry, one of the most effective solutions is the use of digital tools enabling businesses to monitor and visualize their energy consumption in real-time. Due to recent advancements in industrial digitalization, many industrial sites already generate data, including energy monitoring data, with varying degrees of digital maturity.

This approach allows the creation of an energy Digital Twin.

This has opened up new possibilities for using cameras to detect fire and smoke for fire warning purposes. However, the high computational demands of deep CNNs make them unsuitable for low computing power devices, which is a challenge for fire detection. A fire detection algorithm based on adaptive region decoupling knowledge distillation has been proposed to address this. Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique that transfers knowledge from a larger, more accurate teacher model to a smaller, less accurate student model. This allows the smaller model to achieve relatively high accuracy using fewer parameters and computational resources. In the proposed approach, the most informative region of the feature map is selected through adaptive region selection, and separate the foreground and background of this region, distilling them with different weights. This approach has been applied to state-of-the-art detectors, and experiments have been conducted on the D-fire dataset. The experiments demonstrate that this approach has improved the AP score from 37.9 to 38.9 for Gfocal with ResNet-50 while training each model for only 12 epochs, especially without incurring any additional cost. Additionally, the proposed approach has achieved similar AP scores as the teacher model but with lower model complexity, fewer parameters, and a faster detection speed of less than 50 milliseconds per image. Specifically, this approach addresses the challenge of deploying such models for fire detection and proposes a promising solution.","","979-8-3503-0900-3","10.1109/CSIS-IAC60628.2023.10364042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10364042","Convolutional Neural Network;Fire detection;Knowledge Distillation","Training;Deep learning;Adaptation models;Costs;Computational modeling;Object detection;Detectors","","","","16","IEEE","27 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The resource allocation of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications for vehicular platoons is studied in this paper. First, a multi-objective function is formulated to jointly optimize sub-band and power allocation to satisfy quality-of-service (QoS) in vehicular networks. With the advantage of dealing with complex decision-making problems in multi-agent systems, distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) stands out for resource allocation of vehicular networks. However, it faces the challenge of cooperation ageing when every agent is only learning from information of others to form a cooperation model in the training process. Considering the random and dynamic combination of vehicles in vehicle platooning, a tactic-interactive MADRL method named as TacNet is then proposed to improve the cooperation efficiency of multiple agents. In TacNet, the tactics of other agents will be encoded and transmitted through interactive communications among agents. In addition, with the development of vehicular edge computing (VEC), digital twin (DT) networks are constructed to assist offloading computation-intensive resource allocation tasks in vehicles to the edge. The superiority of the proposed method is verified through extensive simulation results, which refers to convergence and performance of satisfying diversified QoS requirements compared with state-of-the-art MADRL methods.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3345853","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901191,62001054,62101064,62272053); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10375296","vehicular networks;resource allocation;digital twin;multi-agent deep reinforcement learning","Resource management;Decision making;Quality of service;Training;Task analysis;Vehicle-to-infrastructure;Vehicle dynamics","","","","","IEEE","27 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

As an alternative solution, semi-supervised learning (SSL) can effectively alleviate the dependence on the annotated samples by leveraging abundant unlabeled samples. Among the SSL methods, mean-teacher (MT) is the most popular one. However, in MT, teacher model’s weights are completely determined by student model’s weights, which will lead to the training bottleneck at the late training stages. Besides, only pixel-wise consistency is applied for unlabeled data, which ignores the category information and is susceptible to noise. In this paper, we propose a bilateral supervision network with bilateral exponential moving average (bilateral-EMA), named BSNet to overcome these issues. On the one hand, both the student and teacher models are trained on labeled data, and then their weights are updated with the bilateral-EMA, and thus the two models can learn from each other. On the other hand, pseudo labels are used to perform bilateral supervision for unlabeled data. Moreover, for enhancing the supervision, we adopt adversarial learning to enforce the network generate more reliable pseudo labels for unlabeled data. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets to evaluate the proposed BSNet, and results show that BSNet can improve the semi-supervised segmentation performance by a large margin and surpass other state-of-the-art SSL methods.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2023.3347689","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62272248); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10375506","Semi-supervised Learning;Bilateral-EMA;Bilateral Supervision;Medical Image Segmentation","Image segmentation;Training;Data models;Adversarial machine learning;Task analysis;Uncertainty;Reliability","","","","","IEEE","28 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This paper uses transformer-based encoder-projector-decoder neural network models to study the material characteristics under ideal excitations, which cannot be done with traditional methods.

Moreover, the DT models can support intelligent automation by integrating with the digital foundation and the data analytics provided by the cyber-physical system (CPS) in an industrial environment. To properly model a physical process, a DT model should be updated online to closely and timely model the underlying process and reduce modeling uncertainty in the CPS. However, most DT models are created offline and implemented online, which cannot be easily updated by using online data from heterogeneous product designs or manufacturing processes. This limitation arises from existing online learning methods, which are typically designed for identical structures, while real manufacturing CPS involves personalized designs and diverse processes. More importantly, there are limited samples for the same product design or manufacturing process due to manufacturing personalization, which slows down the online updating of DT models. In this article, the authors investigated online DT model updating based on data collected from different product designs and/or processes. The authors proposed a mutual active learning framework to identify informative samples from different designs or processes for online DT model updating. Specifically, by properly balancing the gradient-based features of the DT models and the similarity among these heterogeneous designs or processes, the proposed method can effectively query the most informative samples among heterogeneous processes to update the corresponding DT model in a timely manner.

Recent advancements in computer modelling, notably the concept of a “digital twin” for printing-imaging channels, allow for enhanced scalability and the optimization of authentication systems. Yet, the development of an accurate digital twin is far from trivial. This paper extends previous research which modelled a printing-imaging channel using a machine learning-based digital twin for CDP. This model, built upon an information-theoretic framework known as “Turbo”, demonstrated superior performance over traditional generative models such as CycleGAN and pix2pix. However, the emerging field of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) presents a potential advancement in generative models due to its ability to stochastically model the inherent randomness of the printing-imaging process, and its impressive performance in image-to-image translation tasks. This study aims at comparing the capabilities of the Turbo framework and DDPM on the same CDP datasets, with the goal of establishing the real-world benefits of DDPM models for digital twin applications in CDP security. Furthermore, the paper seeks to evaluate the generative potential of the studied models in the context of mobile phone data acquisition. Despite the increased complexity of DDPM methods when compared to traditional approaches, our study highlights their advantages and explores their potential for future applications.","2157-4774","979-8-3503-2491-4","10.1109/WIFS58808.2023.10375049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10375049","Copy detection patterns;machine learning;digital twin;denoising diffusion model;TURBO;CycleGAN;pix2pix","Training;Printing;Computational modeling;Scalability;Stochastic processes;Production;Probabilistic logic","","","","14","IEEE","1 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This means that operating minor networks independently at their local domains and allowing separated domains to handle services without centralized management may become more mainstream. AI and ML will become important enablers for future network management and control. This segregation within the mobile network architecture allows AI-driven components to maximally utilize resources at their local domain. In addition, minor domains would be able to decompose service requests to reduce operational cost incurred by the network. This network modeling takes advantage of fully automated elements and services that could be onboarded upon user demand for more efficient networks that fully utilize resources in a cost-efficient manner.

However, with the ever-growing scale of the edge-cloud systems as well as the rapid advances in future 6G technologies, there exists a critical issue that limits the deep penetration of future 6G enabled edge intelligence services, i.e., how to accurately evaluate the performance when leveraging the emerging yet pre-matured technologies, protocols, and algorithms into the existing systems. The recent advanced Digital Twin (DT) has been envisioned to provide a fault-tolerant and low-cost platform for accurately simulating and evaluating the emerging technologies, protocols, and algorithms, without causing any negative influence on the existing systems. The essence of DT aims at enabling a systematic and fully digitalized modeling systems that can produce accurate digital model of the corresponding physical identity in the DT-space. By simulating the digital models in the DT-space, DT can accurately and reliably predict and estimate the dynamics and evolutions of the physical networks during the entire life cycle, thus providing a timely and risk-free methodology for evaluating the performance when adopting the emerging yet pre-matured technologies, protocols, and algorithms for network management. Therefore, DT has been considered as an efficient scheme for addressing the challenging issue to 6G enabled edge intelligence, and thus has attracted lots of interests from both academia and industries. It is observed that DT and edge intelligence can benefit each other, which thus yields a deep convergence of themselves. On the one hand, the increasing network scale, complexity, and security risks of edge intelligence raise more challenges to the security and reliability. DT can accurately simulate and predict the performance of edge intelligence services and thus provide accurate benchmark references for edge services. On the other hand, to enable accurate mapping and real-time synchronization between the physical identifies and their digital models, DT necessitates massive sensing of the targeted physical identifies as well as the consequent data analytics and modeling. Moreover, efficient yet low-latency transmissions of the sensing data and the data analytics (e.g., the inference models) are required. 6G edge intelligence can naturally provide a solution to these requirements. Therefore, this special issue focuses on the convergence of DT and 6G enabled Edge Intelligence, from the perspectives of theories, algorithms, and applications.","1673-5447","","10.23919/JCC.2023.10061658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10061658","","Special issues and sections;Digital twins;Edge computing;6G mobile communication","","","","","","7 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The influx of distributed service nodes and gradually perfected deep learning theories are now pushing the network communication environment into a wave of intelligence. In the 6G era, more emphasis will be placed on the immersive experience of humans in the space where perception, transmission, and computing are integrated. Consequently, this promotes a paradigm shift from traditional sensing devices by enabling non-perceptual devices with the capability of data perception. On the other hand, it also requires researchers to realize the mining and utilization of massive data. In addition, digital twin technology has also gradually merged into traditional application fields and expanded to a wider field of enabling intelligent network services.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2023.10183784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10183784","","Special issues and sections;6G mobile communication;Artificial intelligence;Digital systems;Intelligent networks;Communication networks","","","","0","IEEE","13 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Addressing the challenges on the road towards realizing 6G network requirements in terms of quality of service, user experience, and security, is therefore of utmost importance. The digital twin (DT) technology can potentially improve the efficiency, reliability, and security of 6G networks. Digital twins for mobile networks (DTMNs) are seen as a key factor in harnessing the full benefits of 6G. Using digital twins can help address several problems, including network optimization, fault diagnosis, and fault management. Furthermore, DTMNs can characterize the physical entities in a 6G network and their relationships to each other, build their virtual models, and use simulation, learning, and reasoning capabilities to make predictions and support informed decision-making,","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2023.3313017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10297965","","Special issues and sections;6G mobile communication;Digital twins;Mobile communication","","","","0","IEEE","26 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Call for papers: Special issue on privacy-preserving data mining for artificial intelligence of things","",,"Big Data Mining and Analytics","27 Dec 2021","2022","5","1","80","80","Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is experiencing unimaginable fast booming with the popularization of end devices and advanced machine learning and data processing techniques. An increasing volume of data is being collected every single second to enable Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the Internet of Things (IoT). The explosion of data brings significant benefits to various intelligent industries to provide predictive services and research institutes to advance human knowledge in data-intensive fields. To make the best use of the collected data, various data mining techniques have been deployed to extract data patterns. In classic scenarios, the data collected from IoT devices is directly sent to cloud servers for processing using diverse methods such as training machine learning models. However, the network between cloud servers and massive end devices may not be stable due to irregular bursts of traffic, weather, etc. Therefore, autonomous data mining that is self-organized by a group of local devices to maintain ongoing and robust AI services plays a growing important role for critical IoT infrastructures. Privacy issues become more concerning in this scenario. The data transmitted via autonomous networks are publicly accessible by all internal participants, which increases the risk of exposure. Besides, data mining techniques may reveal sensitive information from the collected data. Various attacks, such as inference attacks, are emerging and evolving to breach sensitive data due to its great financial benefits. Motivated by this, it is essential to devise novel privacy-preserving autonomous data mining solutions for AIoT. In this Special Issue, we aim to gather state-of-art advances in privacy-preserving data mining and autonomous data processing solutions for AIoT. Topics include, but are not limited to, the following: • Privacy-preserving federated learning for AIoT • Differentially private machine learning for AIoT • Personalized privacy-preserving data mining • Decentralized machine learning paradigms for autonomous data mining using blockchain • AI-enhanced edge data mining for AIoT • AI and blockchain empowered privacy-preserving big data analytics for AIoT • Anomaly detection and inference attack defense for AIoT • Privacy protection measurement metrics • Zero trust architectures for privacy protection management • Privacy protection data mining and analysis via blockchain-enabled digital twin.","2096-0654","","10.26599/BDMA.2021.9020026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9663263","","","","","","","","27 Dec 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"
